Itisalways rendered asfine, fairorbeautiful; intheformula under discussion, itisalmost always rendered asfine.Thismayoftensound strange toourears, but itiswell tomaintain thedistinction inthehope ofbecoming aware ofa subtlety inSocrates' style, asubtlety based onaforgotten moral viewpoint. Thepassage towhich thisnote refers isacase inpoint. Foraprecise discus- sionofthedifference inthePlatonic usages ofthese terms, cf.SethBenardete, "The Right, theTrue, andtheBeautiful" [Glotta, XLI (1963), pp.54-62]. 20.Another reading, much lesswellsupported bythemanuscripts, would givethefollowing translation:"'Isn'tPolemarchus theheirofallthat belongs toyou?' Isaid." 21.Theword for"sacrifices" isidentical with thegeneric term forthe "sacred." This isthevery lastword concerning Cephalus. He isintroduced to, andremoved from, thedialogue intheatmosphere ofancestral pietywhich he represents andbywhich hissituation inthis lifeandthenext isprotected. 22.The Greek word istechne, from which theEnglish words "technical" and"technique" arederived. Itdoes notmean artinthepresent- daysense, butrather intheolder sense implied, forexample, bytheword ar- tisan. Itmeans adiscipline operating onthebasis ofprinciples thatcanbe taught. Itis,hence, notopposed toscience butallied with it,and inPlato the terms "art"and"science" areoften indistinguishable; anartisalways amodel ofwhat isrational and intelligible. 23.Theterm isderived from theword koinon, which means "common" or"public." Allthewords forpartner orpartnership usedbySocrates inthis context aredrawn from thisroot; the last,afewlines farther on, iskoinonia which isaclassic term forapolitical community. "Contracts," usedby Polemarchus, implies relations having primarily todowithmoney. Socrates, inintroducing thebroader term, indicates thattheproper context forthesolu- tionoftheproblem ofjustice isthepolitical community. 24.Apparently thiswasagame similar tocheckers. InPlato, itisoften employed asasymbol ofdialectic, justashousebuilding orarchitecture (the nextexample) frequently stands forlawgiving. Indialectic, premises—like pieces—are setdown and arechanged inrelation tothemoves ofone's partners. Thegame canbeplayed over,andone'smoves canbeimproved on thebasis ofexperience with theopponent's moves. Itisafriendly combat and anamusement for itsownsake (cf.487b— c). 25.TheGreek word islogoswhich most simply means "speech" and is derived from theverb "tospeak." Itcanalsomean story, discourse, argument, [443 ] IHEREPUBLIC andreason; itisspeech andwhat speech implies—^human reason asexpressed inspeech. Atthisstage inthediscussion begins the firstreflection onthatac- tivity ofdiscussion inwhich theinterlocutors findthemselves engaged. Inthis edition theword willalways betranslated as"speech" or"argument," except inafewinstances where itmustberendered as"reason." 26.Odyssey, XIX, 395-396. Theother grandfather, previously men- tioned (330b), should notbeforgotten inthiscontext. 27.This isatranslation oftheword arete; itisthetranslation usedby Cicero and allother thinkers inthetradition ofmoral andpolitical thought. Itmeans, broadly stated, "the specific excellence ofathing." "What isvir- tue?" isthetypical Socratic question, andnoanswer canbegiven toitinthe Platonic context unless allthesubtle andvarious usesoftheword itselfbe followed throughout thework. Contemporary usage hasnarrowed thesense of theword, butwe stillcangrasp itsbroader meaning. Ifwe failtorecognize thatourunderstanding ofvirtue isdifferent from theclassical view,wecannot become aware ofthevery great change inmoral understanding thathasoc- curred. Themoral sense ofvirtue canonlybedeveloped inrelation toits larger sense, and, thus, itisnoaccident thatSocrates' firstuseoftheword isin relation tohorses. Arete v/iWalways berendered as"virtue" throughout this translation. Anyother procedure would simply render theproblem posed by theword invisible. 28.Biasand Pittacus wereamong thesemilegendary "Seven Wise Men." Many wise sayings areattributed tothem. Simonides, thesource of Polemarchus' definition ofjustice, wasapoet, aptly described byLessing as "theGreek Voltaire." 29.Periander wasasixth-century tyrant ofCorinth [usually counted among the"Seven WiseMen," butnotbySocrates {Protagoras, 343a)]. Per- diccas IIwaskingofMacedonia, father ofArchelaus {Gorgias, 471b). Xerxes wasthePersian kingwho ledthegreat expedition against Greece.
