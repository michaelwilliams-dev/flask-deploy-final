pe1form its work well? Nobody would want to have a sick body or a horse that could not puH its load. It therefore follows that justice, as the virtue of the soul, is desirable in itself. In addition to its other weaknesses, this argument is purely formal and empty. Everyone wish? es to have a healthy soul. But what it consists in is the question. Above all, it is not clear that the justice spoken of in this third argu? ment is identical with that spoken of in the second one. Is the man who obeys the laws of the community for the sake of ultimate gain precisely the same man as the one who is perfecting his soul? Are there not two definitions of justice implied here that have no necessary connection, so that the man who fulfills the commands. of the one is not necessarily fulfiJling the commands of the other and may even be contradicting them? Thus ends the inconclusive argument with Thrasymachus, and he is shunted aside. But two important objects have been accomplished by the confrontation. The traditional definitions of justice have been reduced to a shambles, revealing the need for a fresh start. Fur? the1more, although, as Socrates �disa1mingly admits, they have not defined justice but have wandered, their wandering has not been pur? poseless-they have not defined justice, but they have succeeded in defining the problem of justice. Justice is either what makes a city prosper or it is a virtue of the sou] and hence necessary to the happiness of the individual. The question is whether the two possibilities are identical, whether devotion to the common good leads to the health of the soul-�o,r_ whether the man with a healthy soul is devoted to the com? mon good. It is left to Glaucon and Adeimantus to pose this question which is the distillation of the arguments of Book I. (357a-367e) With Glaucon and Adeimantus, Socrates becomes a teacher. \Ve watch him educating those Athenian youths he was ac? cused of corn.Jpting. The action of the Republic now becomes a formal response to the charge made in Aristophanes' Clouds which showed Soc? rates leaving the scene and permitting the unjust speech to overcome the just one. Here he becomes the defender of justice; indeed the whole Rep11blic represents the triumph of the just speech. The two youths, brothers of Plato, introduce a new element into the dialogue. (For another account of Socrates' relationship to Glaucon, cf. Xenophon, Mernorabilia, III, vi.) They are pot ntial Athenian statesmen, men whose goals transcend the horizon of sensuality and money which limited the interlocutors of the first book. They are lovers of honor, which lends nobility to their souls, frees them from the goals which ren? dered Thrasymachus' notion of advantage so crude and narrow, and gives them the spiritual substance required for the sublimating ex? perience of Socratic education. They have often heard the arguments of rhetoricians and sophists, all of which, according to Glaucon, propound
