enemy to estimate his whereabouts. This being so, the places that I shall hold are precisely those that the enemy cannot attack."] 8. Hence that general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack. [An aphorism which puts the whole art of war in a nutshell.] CHAPTER 7. WEAK POINTS AND STRONG 55 9. O divine art of subtlety and secrecy! Through you we learn to be invisible, through you inaudible; [Literally, "without form or sound," but it is said of course with reference to the enemy.] and hence we can hold the enemy�s fate in our hands. 10. You may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you make for the en- emy�s weak points; you may retire and be safe from pursuit if your move- ments are more rapid than those of the enemy. 11. If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an engagement even though he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch. All we need do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve. [Tu Mu says: "If the enemy is the invading party, we can cut his line of communications and occupy the roads by which he will have to return; if we are the invaders, we may direct our attack against the sovereign him- self." It is clear that Sun Tzu, unlike certain generals in the late Boer war, was no believer in frontal attacks.] 12. If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy from engaging us even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the ground. All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in his way. [This extremely concise expression is intelligibly paraphrased by Chia Lin: "even though we have constructed neither wall nor ditch." Li Ch�uan says: "we puzzle him by strange and unusual dispositions;" and Tu Mu finally clinches the meaning by three illustrative anecdotes�one of Chu-ko Liang, who when occupying Yang-p�ing and about to be attacked by Ssu- ma I, suddenly struck his colors, stopped the beating of the drums, and flung open the city gates, showing only a few men engaged in sweeping and sprinkling the ground. This unexpected proceeding had the intended effect; for Ssu-ma I, suspecting an ambush, actually drew off his army and retreated. What Sun Tzu is advocating here, therefore, is nothing more nor less than the timely use of "bluff."] 13. By discovering the enemy�s dispositions and remaining invisible ourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated, while the enemy�s must be divided. [The conclusion is perhaps not very obvious, but Chang Yu (after Mei Yao- ch�en) rightly explains it thus: "If the enemy�s dispositions are visible, we can make for him in one body; whereas, our own dispositions being kept secret, the enemy will be obliged to divide his forces in order to guard
