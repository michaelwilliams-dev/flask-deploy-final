than many, but the true virtue of the single-minded and har? ï¿½.monized soul would escape far from him." "That's my opinion." , "Furthermore, the stingy man is a poor contestant when with his private means he competes for some victory or any other noble object of ambition in a city; he's not willing to spend money for the sake of good reputation or any such contests. Afraid to awaken the spendthrift desires and to summon them to an alliance and a love of victory, he makes war like an oligarch, with a few of his troops, is defeated most of the time, and stays rich." "Quite so," he said. "Do we then still doubt," I said, "that the stingy, money-making man, in virtue of his likeness, corresponds to the oligarchic city?" "Not at all," he said. "Then, democracy, must, as it seems, be considered next-in what way it comes into being and, once come into being, what it is like-so that when we know the character of such a man in his tum, we can bring him forward for judgment." "In that," he said, "we would at least be proceeding just as we were." "Doesn't," I said, "the transformation from an oligarchy to a democracy take place in something like the following way, as a result of the insatiable character of the good that oligarchy proposes for it? self-the necessity of becoming as rich as possible?"

"Then, by their neglect and encouragement of licentiousness in oligarchies, they have sometimes compelled human beings who are not ignoble to become poor." \ 555d e 556a b C d "Quite so." "Then I suppose these men sit idly in the city, fitted out With stings and fully armed, some owing debts-, some dishonored, and some both, hating and plotting against those who acquired what belongs to them and all the rest too, gripped by a love of change." "That's so." "And these money-makers, with heads bent down, not seeming to see these men, wound with injections of silver any man among the re? mainder who yields; and carrying off from the father a multiple off? spring in interest,15 they make the drone and the beggar great in the city." "Very great indeed," he said. "And, at all events," I said, "they aren't willing to quench this kind of evil-as it is
