Ji was that half of good advice is knowing when to take it. As he said to the emperor of Ming China, �Why worry that there is no talent in the country? Just let an enlightened leadership seek it wholeheartedly.� Liu Ji is famous not only as a warrior, strategist, and statesman, but also as a poet and writer. One of his early works, entitled The Cultured One, written during his first retirement, illustrates his philosophy of life, society, and government. In a passage on conflict avoidance, Liu demonstrates his understanding of the Taoist attitude characteristic of the higher strategy extolled in Sun Tzu�s classic The Art of War: Good warriors lessen opponents, bad warriors increase opponents. Those who decrease opponents flourish thereby, those who increase opponents perish. If you want to take other people�s nations, then the people of those nations are all your opponents. Therefore those who are good at lessening opponents do not cause people to oppose them. The reason wise leaders of old had no opponents was that they used their opponents to oppose opponents. Only the most humane people in the world can use their opponents to oppose opponents; for this reason opponents did not oppose them, and everyone capitulated. Further insights into Liu�s political and practical thinking can be gleaned from his poetry. Several of his verses show his profound grasp of the contradictions of historical processes and the paradoxical strategy of The Art of War at its best: A nation does not prosper itself; If its people have enough, it is prosperous. Rulers are not powerful themselves; When they have many knights they are strong. So when those full of envy are in office, Knights retire to private life, And rulers just bleed them with taxes. When bureaucrats advance, people get hurt, And then the nation is wounded. When force brings loss of freedom, A little flexibility can overcome a great power. When there is stasis in formation, Even the mighty and ferocious Cannot conquer the small but secure. Thus a man-eating tiger cannot swallow a single porcupine, But a goat leash may be used to harness nine gelded bulls. There are impasses and successes As a matter of course: One cannot prevail just by wits. Fame may be gained or lost, And cannot be achieved by force. So even if you have no worldly ambitions, You won�t necessarily escape slander. Even if you seek nothing from others, Your advice won�t necessarily be put into effect. Those who save the world from chaos Are not occupied with petty matters; Those who accomplish the ongoing evolution of the world Are not conceited over small accomplishments. So that which cuts rotting flesh Is not to be considered a sharp sword, And that which penetrates a naked body Is not to be considered a good bow. Liu Ji�s philosophy of war is epitomized in certain chapters from his neoclassic Extraordinary Strategies of a Hundred Battles. This book, based mainly on The Art of War and its
