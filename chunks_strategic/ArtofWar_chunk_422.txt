the four seasons, wind and clouds, and other phenomena.] 7. EARTH comprises distances, great and small; danger and security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death. 8. The COMMANDER stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerely, benevol- ence, courage and strictness. [The five cardinal virtues of the Chinese are (1) humanity or benevolence; (2) uprightness of mind; (3) self-respect, self- control, or "proper feeling;" (4) wisdom; (5) sincerity or good faith. Here "wisdom" and "sincerity" are put before "humanity or benevolence," and the two military virtues of "courage" and "strictness" substituted for "uprightness of mind" and "self- respect, self-control, or �proper feeling.�"] 7. By METHOD AND DISCIPLINE are to be understood the marshaling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military expenditure. 8. These five heads should be familiar to every general: he who knows them will be victorious; he who knows them not will fail. 9. Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the military conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in this wise: 10. (1) Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral law? [I.e., "is in harmony with his subjects." Cf. ss. 5.] 2. Which of the two generals has most ability? 3. With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth? [See ss. 7,8] 4. On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced? [Tu Mu alludes to the remarkable story of Ts�ao Ts�ao (A.D. 155-220), who was such a strict disciplinarian that once, in accordance with his own severe regulations against injury to standing crops, he condemned himself to death for having allowed him horse to shy into a field of corn! However, in lieu of losing his head, he was persuaded to satisfy his sense of justice by cutting off his hair. Ts�ao Ts�ao�s own comment on the present passage is characteristically curt: "when you lay down a law, see that it is not disobeyed; if it is disobeyed the offender must be put to death."] 2. Which army is stronger? CHAPTER 2. LAYING PLANS 31 [Morally as well as physically. As Mei Yao-ch�en puts it, freely rendered, "ESPIRIT DE CORPS and �big battalions.�"] 2. On which side are officers and men more highly trained? [Tu Yu quotes Wang Tzu as saying: "Without constant practice, the officers will be nervous and undecided when mustering for battle; without constant practice, the general will be wavering and irresolute when the crisis is at hand."] 2. In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and pun- ishment? [On which side is there the most absolute certainty that merit will be prop- erly rewarded and misdeeds summarily punished?] 7. By means of these seven considerations I can forecast victory or defeat. 8. The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon it, will con- quer: �let such a one be retained
