ForRikyu,the secret ofsuccess consisted inappearing natural, concealingtheeffort behind one’s work. OnedayRikyuand his son went toanacquaintance’s house for atea ceremony. Ontheway in,the sonremarked that thelovely antique—look~ inggateattheir host’s housegaveitanevocatively lonely appearance. “I don’t think so,”repliedhisfather, “itlooks asthoughithad beenbrought from some mountain temple along way off,and asifthelabor requiredto importitmust have cost alotofmoney.” Ifthe owner ofthehouse hadput this much effort into onegate,itwould show inhisteaceremony-—-and in- deed Sen noRikyuhad toleave theceremony early, unable toendure the affectation and effort itinadvertentlyrevealed. Onanother evening,while havingtea atafriend’s house, Rikyusaw hishost gooutside, hold upalantem inthedarkness, cut alemon offatree, andbring itin.This charmed Rikyu--thehost needed a.relish forthedish hewasserving, and hadspontaneously goneoutside togetone. Butwhen the man offered thelemon with some Osaka ricecake, Rikyu realized that hehadplanned thecuttingofthelemon allalong,togowith thisexpensive delicacy. The gesturenolonger seemed spontane0us—~itwas awayforthe host toprovehiscleverness. Hehadaccidentally revealed how hard he wastrying. Havingseen enough, Rikyu politelydeclined thecake, excused himself, and left. Emperor Hideyoshionce planned tovisitRikyu for a.teaceremony. Onthenight before hewas tocome, snow begantofall.Thinking quickly, Rikyulaid round cushions that fitexactlyoneach ofthesteppingvstones that ledthrough thegardentohishouse. Just before dawn, herose, saw that ithadstopped snowing,andcarefullyremoved thecushions. When Hideyoshi arrived, hemarveled atthesimple beautyofthesight-—tl1e per- fectlyround stepping stones, unencumbered bysnow——-and noticed how it called noattention tothe manner inwhich Rikyuhadaccomplished it,but onlytothepolite gesture itself. After Sen noRikyu died, hisideas had aprofound influence onthe practiceofthe teaceremony. TheTokugawa shogun Yorinobu, sonofthe great Emperor Ieyasu,was astudent ofRikyu's teachings.Inhisgarden he had astone lantern made byafamous master, and Lord Sakai Tadakatsu asked ifhecould come byoneday toseeit.Yoriuobu repliedthat hewould behonored, and commanded hisgardenerstoputeverythinginorder for the visit. These gardeners, unfamiliar with thepreceptsofCha-no~yu, thought the stone lantern misshapen,itswindows being toosmall forthe presenttaste. Theyhad alocal workman enlarge thewindows. Afewdays before Lord Sakai’s visit, Yorinobu toured thegarden. ‘When hesaw theal- tered windows heexploded with rage, readytoimpaleonhissword the foolwho had mined thelantern, upsettingitsnaturalgraceanddestroying thewholepurposeofLord Sakafs visit. When Yorinobu calmed down, however, heremembered that hehad originally boughttwoofthelanterns, and that thesecond was inhisgarden ontheisland ofKishu. Atgreat expense, hehired awhale boat and the finest rowers hecould find, orderingthem tobringthelantern tohim within twodays—adifficult feat atbest, But the sailors roweddayand night, and with theluck ofagoodwind they arrived justintime. To‘[011- nobu’s delight, this stone lantern was more magnificentthan thefirst, forit had stood untouched fortwenty yearsinabamboo thicket, acquiring2-1 brilliant antique appearanceand adelicate coveringofmoss. When Lord Sakai arrived, later that same day, hewas awed bythelantern, which was more magnificentthan hehad imag1'ned———so gracefuland atonewith the elements. Fortunately hehad noidea what time and effort ithad cost Yori- nobu tocreate thissublime
