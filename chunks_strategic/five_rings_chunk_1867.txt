"However, Adeimantus, themanwho ismixed ispleasing; and byfarthemost pleasing toboysandtheir teachers, andtothegreatmob too, isthemanopposed totheoneyouchoose." "Yes," hesaid,"he isthemost pleasing." "But," Isaid, "perhaps youwould sayhedoesn't harmonize with eourregime because there's nodouble manamong us,noramanifold one, since eachmandoesonething." "No,hedoesn't harmonize." "Isn't itforthisreason that it'sonly insuch acitythat we'll find theshoemaker ashoemaker, andnotapilot along with hisshoemaking, andthefarmer afarmer, andnotajudge along with hisfarming, and theskilled warrior askilled warrior, andnotamoneymaker along with his warmaking, andsoonwiththem all?" "True," hesaid. 398a "Now, asitseems, ifamanwho isablebywisdom tobecome every sortofthing andtoimitate allthings should come toour city, wishing tomake adisplay ofhimself andhispoems, wewould fallon ourknees before him asaman sacred, wonderful, andpleasing; butwe would saythatthere isnosuchmanamong usinthe city,nor isit lawful^ forsuch aman tobebom there.Wewould sendhim toan- other city, withmyrrh poured over hishead andcrowned with wool, whileweourselves would useamore austere andlesspleasing poetand b teller oftales forthesake ofbenefit, onewhowould imitate the style ofthedecent manandwould saywhathesays inthose models thatwesetdown aslaws atthebeginning, whenweundertook toedu- catethesoldiers." "Indeed that iswhatwewould do,"hesaid, "ifitwereuptous." "Now, myfriend," Isaid, "it's likelywearecompletely finished with thatpartofmusic thatconcerns speeches and tales.What mustbe toldandhow itmustbetoldhavebeen stated." "That's myopinion too,"hesaid. c "After that," Isaid, "doesn't what concerns themanner ofsong andmelody remain?" "Plainly."

"At allevents," Isaid,"you are, inthe firstplace, surely capable d ofsaying thatmelody iscomposed ofthree things—speech, harmonic mode, andrhythm." "Yes," hesaid, "that Icando." "What's speech initsurely doesn't differ from thespeech that isn'tsung insofar asitmust bespoken according tothesame models weprescribed awhile agoandinthesameway." "True," hesaid. "And, further, theharmonic mode andtherhythm must follow thespeech." "Ofcourse." "Moreover, wesaidthere isnofurther need ofwailing andlainen- tations inspeeches." "No, there isn't." "What arethewailing modes? Tellme,foryou're musical." e "The mixed Lydian," hesaid, "and the 'tight' Lydian andsome similar ones." "Aren't they tobeexcluded?" Isaid. "They're useless even for women whoaretobedecent, letalone formen." "Certainly." "Then again, drunkenness, softness, and idleness aremost un- seemly forguardians.' "Ofcourse." "What modes aresoftandsuitable forsymposia?"^^ "There aresome Ionian, "hesaid, "andsome Lydian, too,which arecalled 'slack.'" "Could you,myfriend, usethem forwar-making men?" 399a "Not atall,"hesaid. "So,you've probably gottheDorian andthe Phrygian left." "Idon'tknow themodes," Isaid. "Just leave thatmode which would appropriately imitate thesounds andaccents ofamanwho is courageous inwarlike deeds andevery violent work, andwho infailure orwhen going tofacewounds ordeath orfalling intosome other b disaster, inthefaceofallthese things stands upfirmly andpatiently against chance.
