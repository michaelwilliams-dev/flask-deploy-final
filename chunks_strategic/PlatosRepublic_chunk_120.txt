things of friends will be in common."3 449 a b C SOCRATES/ADEIMANTUS/GLAUCONfTHRASYMACHUS THE REPUBLIC 449 cï¿½ d 450a b C d "Isn't that right, Adeimantus?" I said. "Yes," he said, "but this 'right,' like the rest, is in need of argu? ment as to what the manner of the community is. There could be many ways. So don't pass over the particular one you mean, since we've been waiting all this time supposing you would surely mention begetting of children-how they'll be begotten and, once born, how they'll be reared-and that whole community of women and children of which you speak. We think it makes a big difference, or rather, the whole dif? ference, in a regime's being right or not right. Now, since you're taking on another regime before having adequately treated these things, we've resolved what you heard-not to release you before you've gone through all this just as you did the rest." "Include me too as a partner in this vote," said Glaucon. "In fact," said Thrasymachus, "you cari take this as a resolution approved by all of us, Socrates."4 "What a thing you've done in arresting me," I said. "How much discussion you've set in motion, from the beginning again as it were, about the regime I was delighted to think I had already described, content if one were to leave it at accepting these things as they were stated then. You don't know how great a swarm of arguments you're stirring up with what you are now summoning to the bar. I saw it then and passed by so as not to cause a lot of trouble." "What," said Thrasymachus, "do you suppose these men have come here now to look for fool's gold5 and not to listen to argu? ments?" "Yes," I said, "but in due measure." "For intelligent men, Socrates," said Glaucon, "the proper measure of listening to such arguments is a whole life. Never mind about us. And as for you, don't weary in going through your opinion about the things we ask: what the community of children and women wi1l be among our guardians, and their rearing when they are still young, in the time between birth and education, which seems to be the most trying. Attempt to say what the manner of it must be." "It's not easy to go through, you happy man," I said. "Even more than what we went through before, it admits of many doubts. For, it could be doubted that the things said are possible; and, even if, in the best possible conditions, they could come into being, that they would be what is best will also be doubted. So that is why there's a certain hestitation about getting involved in it, for fear that the argument might seem to be a prayer, my dear comrade." "Don't hesitate," he said. "Your audience won't be hard-hearted, or distrustful, or il1-wi1led." Book V I 449c-451 d SOCRATESfGLAUCON And I said, "Best of men, presumably you're saying that
