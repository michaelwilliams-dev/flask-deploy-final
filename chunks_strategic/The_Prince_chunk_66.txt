although now the Prince is replaced in title by a president, prime minister, premier, or dictator. The rules are often the same, al.though the democratic means of coming to power are changed and tempered. The psychological, social, and political dynamics are often similar, viz. Kissinger, viz. Clinton. Further, The Prince still serves as a realistic primer to school, college, and university civics and political science studies.
