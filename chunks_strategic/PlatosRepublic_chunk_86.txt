in them? His medicine is for these men and this condition; with drugs and cut? ting to drive out the diseases, he prescribed their customary regimen so as not to harm the city's affairs. But with bodies diseased through and through, he made no attempt by regimens-drawing off a bit at one time, pouring in a bit at another-to make a lengthy and bryd life for a human being and have him produce offspring likely to be such as he; he didn't think he should care for the man who's not able to live in his established round, on the grounds that he's of no profit to himself or to the city." "You speak," he said, "of a statesmanlike Asclepius."58 "Plainly," I said. "And don't you see that his sons, because he was like that, both showed themselves to be good men in the war at Troy and made use of the art of medicine in the way I say? Or don't you re? member that as well from the wound Pandarus inflicted on Menelaus, They sucked out the blood and sprinkled gentle drugs on it59 and that after this they didn't prescribe what he must drink or eat any more than with Eurypylus, believing the drugs to be sufficient to cure men who before their wounds were healthy and orderly in their regimen, even if they should happen to take a drink mixed with barley, cheese, and wine right away? And, as for those with a naturally sickly and licentious body, they thought that living is of no profit either to themselves or others, that the art shouldn't be applied to them, and that they mustn't be treated-not even if they were richer than Midas." "You speak," he said, "of quite subtle sons of Asclepius." "It's appropriate," I said. "And yet it's in just this that the tragic poets as well as Pindar60 don't obey us. Although they claim Ascle? pius was the son of Apollo, they also say he was persuaded by gold to cure a rich man who was as good as dead and it's for this that he was struck with a thunderbolt. But we, in accord with what was said before, won't believe both things from them; rather if he was a god's son, we'll say he wasn't basely greedy, and if he was basely greedy, he wasn't a god's son." "Quite right in that," he said. "But what do you say about this, Socrates? Won't we need to get good doctors in the city? And, of course, those who have handled the most healthy men and the most sick ones would be the best, and the best judges, similarly, would be those who have been familiar with all sorts of natures." "Yes indeed, I mean good ones," I said. "But do you knowï¿½ whom I consider to be such?" "I would, if you'd tell me," he said. "We11, I'll try," I said. "However you asked about dissimilar mat? ters in the same speech." "How's
