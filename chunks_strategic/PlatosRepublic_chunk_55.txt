"So, on this basis each thing becomes more plentiful, finer, and easier, when one man, exempt from other tasks, does one thing accord? ing to nature and at the crucial moment." "That's entirely certain." "Now, then, Adeimantus, there's need of more citizens than four for the provisions of which we were speaking. For the farmer, as it seems, won't make his own plow himself, if it's going to be a fine one, or his hoe, or the rest of the tools for farming; and the housebuilder won't either-and he needs many too. And it will be the same with the weaver and the shoemaker, won't it?" "True." "So, carpenters, smiths, and many other craftsmen of this sort be? come partners in our little city, making it into a throng." "Most certainly." "But it wouldn't be very big yet, if we added cowherds, shepherds, and the other kinds of herdsmen, so that the farmers would have oxen 370 b C d for plowing, the housebuilders teams to use with the farmers for e ha1.1ling, and the weavers and cobblers hides and wool." "Nor would it be a little city," he said, "when it has all this." "And, further," I said, "just to found the city itself in the sort of place where there will be no need of imports is pretty nearly impossi? ble." "Yes, it is impossible." "Then, there will also be a need for still other men who will bring to it what's needed from another city." "Yes, they will be needed." "Now, if the agent comes empty-handed, bringing nothing needed by those from whom they take what they themselves need, he'll go 371 a away empty-handed, won't he?" "It seems so to me." "Then they must produce at home not only enough for themselves but also the sort of thing and in the quantity needed by these others of whom they have need." ADEIMANTUS/ SOCRATES THE REPUBLIC 371 a "Yes, they must." "So our city needs more farmers and other craftsmen." "It does need more." "And similarly, surely, other agents as well, who will import and export the various products. They. are merchants, aren't they?" "Yes.ï¿½ "Then, we'll need merchants too." "Certainly." "And if the commerce is carried on by sea, there will also be need b. of throngs of other men who know the business of the sea." "Throngs, indeed." "Now what about this? In the city itself, how will they exchange what they have produced with one another? It was for just this that we made a partnership and founded the city." "Plainly," he said, "by buying and selling." "Out of this we'll get a market28 and an established currency29 as a token for exchange." "Most certainly." C "If the farmer or any other craftsman brings what he has pro? duced to the market, and he doesn't arrive at the same time as those who need what he has to exchange, will he sit in the market idle, his craft unattended?" "Not at all," he said.
