study of the good. ï¿½ Glaucon insists that Socrates tell more of the idea of the good, and again takes his brother's place in the discussion. He was the first to ask for an account of justice in terms of the good, and his eroticism impels him to possess the good things. Socrates formulates his account of the good in such a way as to appeal to Glaucon's interest and passion. Glaucon is informed of a good which makes questionable all the good things of which he spoke in his original attack on justice, and the at? tainment of which requires a way of life very different from the tyrant's way of life. Socrates leads Glaucon toward the apprehension of the good by means of the things which Glaucon knows and of which he has already spoken. He agrees that all action is directed toward the attain? ment of some good and that none of the things he desires is unam? biguously good. There are many good things, but none of them are the good. The discussion at the end of Book V concluded that where there is a many to which we give a name, there must also be a one which is the cause of the particulars that constitute that many, which is the thing in itself without qualification. Hence there must be a good in itself, an idea of the good in which the good things participate. A man does not desire those things, but desires the good, which is somehow in them but is not them. The good, however, must also be a super idea, an idea of ideas, for the other ideas, for example, justice, man, beauty, are also good. Therefore these other ideas, the many ideas, are participations in the one idea of the good. _Since the ideas are, the good, then, is the source of being, but beyond being, in the sense that it exists in a way different from the other beings. The good is the transcendent principle of the whole, the cause of the being of things and of the apprehension of being, uniting knower and known, the lover of the good and the good things. As experienced by man, the good is an overpowering combina? tion of pleasure and knowledge. Socrates tells Glaucon that an account of the good cannot be given to him, because he, Socrates, is incapable of giving it and Glaucon is incapable of understanding it. But he agrees to give him an account of the offspring of the good, the sun. The sun is the cause both of things being seeable and their being seen, and is also the cause of the existence of living things. What the sun is in the visible world, the good is in the intelligible world. On the basis of what we know of the visible world with its sun, we can conjecture about the intelligible world with its idea of the good. This Socrates does by drawing the divided line
