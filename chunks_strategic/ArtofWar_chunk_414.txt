The list closes with a commentator of no great originality perhaps, but gifted with admirable powers of lucid exposition. His commentator is based on that of Ts�ao Kung, whose terse sentences he contrives to expand and develop in masterly fashion. Without Chang Yu, it is safe to say that much of Ts�ao Kung�s commentary would have remained cloaked in its pristine obscurity and therefore valueless. His work is not mentioned in the Sung history, the T�UNG K�AO, or the YU HAI, but it finds a niche in the T�UNG CHIH, which also names him as the author of the "Lives of Famous Generals."45 It is rather remarkable that the last-named four should all have flourished within so short a space of time. Ch�ao Kung-wu accounts for it by saying: "During the early years of the Sung dynasty the Empire enjoyed a long spell of peace, and men ceased to practice the art of war. but when [Chao] Yuan-hao�s rebellion came [1038-42] and the frontier generals were defeated time after time, the Court made strenuous inquiry for men skilled in war, and military topics became the 44T�UNG K�AO, ch. 221. 45This appears to be still extant. See Wylie�s "Notes," p. 91 (new edition). CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 21 vogue amongst all the high officials. Hence it is that the commentators of Sun Tzu in our dynasty belong mainly to that period.46 Besides these eleven commentators, there are several others whose work has not come down to us. The SUI SHU mentions four, namely Wang Ling (often quoted by Tu Yu as Wang Tzu); Chang Tzu- shang; Chia Hsu of Wei;47 and Shen Yu of Wu. The T�ANG SHU adds Sun Hao, and the T�UNG CHIH Hsiao Chi, while the T�U SHU mentions a Ming commentator, Huang Jun-yu. It is possible that some of these may have been merely collectors and editors of other commentaries, like Chi T�ien-pao and Chi Hsieh, mentioned above. 1. Appreciations of Sun Tzu Sun Tzu has exercised a potent fascination over the minds of some of China�s greatest men. Among the famous generals who are known to have studied his pages with en- thusiasm may be mentioned Han Hsin (d. 196 B.C.),48 Feng I (d. 34 A.D.),49 Lu Meng (d. 219),50 and Yo Fei (1103-1141).51 The opinion of Ts�ao Kung, who disputes with Han Hsin the highest place in Chinese military annals, has already been recorded.52 Still more remarkable, in one way, is the testimony of purely literary men, such as Su Hsun (the father of Su Tung-p�o), who wrote several essays on military topics, all of which owe their chief inspiration to Sun Tzu. The following short passage by him is preserved in the YU HAI:53 Sun Wu�s saying, that in war one cannot make certain of conquering,54 is very different indeed from what other books tell us.55 Wu Ch�i was a man of the same stamp as Sun Wu: they both
