refuted orthat thisdiscussion hasproved thatthere is sufficient reason todevote oneself tothecommon good.Thediscussion hasonlyserved toheighten thesense ofthedisproportion between the private andthepublic good, tomake justice more problematic than ever. Instead ofabandoning orattempting toimprove Thrasymachus' definition ofjustice, theconversation curiQiisljL.Â£hanges itstheme. Without having established what justice is,Socrates turns totheques- tionofwhether itisgood ornot.It_isinost_ unusual toattempt todeter- mine thedesirability ofathingwhose character onedoesnotknga^.Soc- rates' reason forthisprocedure isthat this iswhat interests theother men present whose attention heistiying toattract andwho believe theyhave afairsense ofwhat justice is.They arenotparticularly in- terested inaphilosophic investigation ofthenature ofjustice, butin howthey will liveprofitably orwell.Thrasymachus hastoldthem that they wi]]dosobybecoming tyrants, bydisregarding thelaws. Socrates appears todisagree. Theywant toknow whether Thrasymachus' ruler I.3.34 ] interpretive Essay lives agood life.Thrasymachus hasstated that itisbad tobejust, in thesense ofcaring forothers, orobeying thelaw,orbeing dedicated to thecommon good. Socrates until now, along with Cephalus and Polemarchus, hasseemed tobelieve thatonemustbejust, thattheonly problem istodefine more precisely what justice is.Now, following Thrasymachus, hemakes thewhole discussion much more radical in permitting thegoodness ofjustice andthejust lifetobecome doubtful. Although justice hasnotbeen defined, anexample ofithasbeen pres- entinthediscussion andthemembers ofthegroup look tothat.That example isthedeposit. Cephalus says that,though itmaybeadesirable object, onemust return itforfearofdivine punishment fornotdoing so.Polemarchus says thatonemust not,indeciding whether toreturn it,consider whether itisdesirable foroneself ornot, inthecaseofa friend, butonlywhether itwilldothefriend good. Thrasymachus says, thatsince thegodsdonotpunish andthere isnocommon good, one should keep deposits andtrytogetasmuchmore aspossible, theonly consideration being one'sown advantage. Glaucon andAdeimantus whoareabout toenter thediscussion understand quite wellwhatThra- symachus istelling them; andSocrates seems tobesaying that itisbad tokeep deposits andbreak faith. This iswhat draws their attention, andSocrates makes them anxious toknowwhyhethinks itisbadtobe- come atyrant. Thequestion ofthegoodness ofjustice, thenature of which they think theyknow, willbethespur totheir quest forthe discovery ofitstrue nature. Torefute Thrasymachus' contention that itisdisadvantageous to bejust, Socrates makes three arguments. First, heestablishes thatThrasymachus holds theunconventional position that injustice isavirtue, meaning byinjustice getting thebet- terof,ormore than, others. Life, inhisview, isacompetition, andhe who ismost talented atthestruggle possesses thegreatest virtue. Atthe endofacomplicated, specious, andamusing chain ofreasoning, Soc- ratesmakes injustice appear tobeavicebecause itiscontrary to wisdom, which isavirtue. Thewiseman,understood againbySocrates asthepossessor ofanart,does notseek towinoutover other possessors ofthesame art.Asamatter offactthey are,assuch, infun- damental haimony, accepting thesame general rules, atone,thesame aseach other. Mathematicians are allseeking thesame result tothe same problem, and, asmathematicians, there isnocompetition among them.The justman ismore likethewiseman inthisthan istheunjust man.Hence justice isvirtue and injustice vice. Now thiswould onlybeconvincing ifjustice werewisdom and if, therefore, theobjects ofhuman action could begained without taking themaway from others. This isbynomeans evident. The result ofthe [335 ] THEREPUBLIC argument serves topoint toward arealm ofnoblehuman activity which isnotessentially competitive, andtoshow thatthedesire tohavemore foroneself isagoalwhich contradicts thecharacter ofartorscience which, likelaw, deals notwith theindividual, butrather with the universal. But thisargument doesnotsuffice toconvince anyone that it ispossible tolivewellwithout being asturdy competitor and re- enforces thedoubt about thedesirability ofbeing devoted toartor wisdom. Socrates onlysucceeded inthisdiscussion because ofThrasyma- chus' incapacity tomake theproper distinctions andtoseetheproblem intheanalogy tothe arts. Surely, itisimpossible tohold that life is simply getting more; butinthecharacter ofcivil society andthepre- cariousness ofhuman lifeandproperty there isasubstantial basis for Thrasymachus' observations which hehasbeenunable todefend. Soc- rates, rather than refuting him, humiliates andpunishes him.Atthe endofthisargument heissho^vn tobeunjust butunwise, discredited before anaudience inhisclaim towsdom,
