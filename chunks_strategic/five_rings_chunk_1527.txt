<,‘()UR’l’ mrris‘i‘. MARTIN VVARNKE. l993 LAW6.147 LAW 6The court ofLouis XIV containedmany talented writers, artists, great beauties, and men and women ofimpeccable virtue, but noone was more talked about than thesingular Due deLauzun. The duke wasshort, almost dwarfish, and he waspronetothe most insolent kinds ofbehavior-—he sleptwith theking’s mistress, andopenly insulted notonly other courtiers butthekinghimself. Louis, however, was sobeguiled bytheduke’s eccen~ tricities that hecould notbeat hisabsences from the court. Itwassimple: The strangeness oftheduke’s character attracted attention. Oncepeople were enthralled byhim, they wanted him around atanycost. Societycraves larger-than-life figures, peoplewho stand above the general mediocrity.Never beafraid, then, ofthequalities that setyouapart and draw attention toyou.Court controversy,even scandal. Itisbetter to beattacked, even slandered, than ignored. Allprofessionsareruled bythis law, and allprofessionalsmust have abitoftheshowman about them. The greatscientist Thomas Edison knew that toraise money hehad to remain inthepublic eyeatanycost. Almost asimportantastheinventions themselves was how hepresented them tothepublicand courted attention. Edison would design w'sual1y dazzling experimentstodisplay hisdis~ coveries with electricity.Hewould talk offuture inventions that seemed fantastic atthe time-—robots, and machines that could photograph thought—-and that hehad nointention ofwasting hisenergy on,butthat made thepublictalk about him. Hedideverythinghecould tomake sure that hereceived more attention than hisgreat rival Nikola Tesla, who may actually have been more brilliant than hewasbutwhose name was farless known. In1915, itwas rumored that Edison and Tesla would bejoint recip- ients ofthatyear’sNobel Prize inphysics.Theprizewaseventually givento apairofEnglish physicists; only later was itdiscovered that theprizecom- mittee hadactually approached Edison, buthehad turned them down, re-v fusingtoshare theprizewith Tesla. Bythat time hisfame was more secure than Tesla’s, and hethoughtitbetter torefuse thehonor than toallow his rival theattention that would have come even from sharing theprize. Ifyoufindyourselfinalowly positionthat offers little opportunityfor youtodraw attention, aneffective trick istoattack the most visible, most famous, most powerful person youcanfind. When Pietro Aretino, ayoung Roman servant boyoftheearly sixteenth century, wanted togetattention asawriter ofverses, hedecided topublishaseries ofsatiricalpoems rid} culing thepopeand hisaffection for apetelephant.The attack putAretino inthepublic eyeimmediately.Aslanderous attack on apersoninaposi- tionofpowerwould have asimilar effect. Remember, however, tousesuch tactics sparinglyafteryouhave thepublic’s attention, when the act can wear thin. Once inthelimelight youmust constantlyrenew itbyadaptingand varying your method ofcourtingattention. Ifyou don’t, thepublic will grow tired, will takeyouforgranted, andwill move ontoanewer star. The game requiresconstant vigilance and creativity. Pablo Picasso never al lowed himself tofade into thebackground;ifhis name became tooat tached toaparticular style,hewould deliberately upsetthepublic with a new series ofpaintingsthat went againstallexpectations.Better tocreate something uglyanddisturbing,hebelieved, than toletviewersgrowtoo fa- miliar with hiswork. Understand: Peoplefeelsuperiortotheperson whose actions theycanpredict. Ifyoushow them who isincontrol byplaying againsttheir expectations, youboth gain their respectandlighten yourhold ondreir fleetingattention. Image: The Limelight.
