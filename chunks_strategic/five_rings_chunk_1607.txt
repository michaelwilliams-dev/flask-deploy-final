MEMOIRS, GIOVANNI CASANOVA, 17254798 192 LAW 25OBSERVANCE OFTHE LAW I JuliusCaesar made hisfirstsignificant mark onRomansocietyin65B.C., when heassumed thepost ofaedile, theofficial incharge ofgraindistribu- tion andpublic games.Hebeganhisentrance into thepublic eyebyorga~ nizingaseries ofcarefullycrafted and well~timedspectac|es——wi1d—beast hunts, extravagant gladiator shows, theatrical contests. On several occa- sions, hepaidforthesespectaclesoutofhis own pocket.Tothe common man, JuliusCaesar became indeliblyassociated with these muclrloved events. Asheslowlyrose toattain theposition ofconsul, hispopularity amongthe masses served asthefoundation ofhispower. Hehad created animageofhimself asagreat publicshowman. In49B.C., Rome was onthebrink ofacivil war between rival leaders, Caesar andPompey. Attheheight ofthetension, Caesar, anaddict ofthe stage,attended atheatrical performance,andafterward, lostinthought, he wandered inthedarkness back tohiscampattheRubicon, therivet that divides Italyfrom Gaul, where hehad been campaigning.Tomarch his armyback intoItalyacross theRubicon would mean thebeginning ofa war withPompey. Before hisstaff Caesar argued both sides, formingtheoptions like an actor onstage,a.precursor ofHamlet. Finally,toputhissoliloquytoan end, hepointedtoaseemingly innocent appaxitionattheedge ofthe river——a verytallsoldier blastingacall on atrumpet,then goingacross a bridgeover the Rubicon————a.nd pronounced, “Let usacceptthis asasign from theGods andfollow where they beckon, invengeanceonourdouble» dealingenemies. The dieiscast.” Allofthishespoke portentouslyand dra- matically, gesturing toward theriver andlookinghisgeneralsintheeye. Heknew that these generalswere uncertain intheirsupport,but his ora- tory overwhelmed them with asense ofthedrama ofthemoment, and of theneed toseize thetime. Amore prosaic speech would never have had the same effect. The generalsrallied tohis cause; Caesar and hisarmy crossed theRubicon andbythefollowing yearhadvanquished Pompey, making Caesar dictator ofRome. Inwarfare, Caesar always playedtheleadingman with gusto.He was asskilled ahorseman asany ofhissoldiers, and took prideinoutdoing them infeats ofbraveryand endurance, Heentered battle astzide the strongest mount, sothat hissoldiers would seehim inthethick ofbattle, urging them on,always positioning himself inthecenter, agodlike symbol ofpowerand amodel forthem tofollow, Ofallthearmies inRome, Cae- sar’s was themost devoted andloyal.Hissoldiers, likethe common people who had attended hisentertainments, had come toidentifywith him and with his cause. After thedefeat ofPompey,theentertainmentsgrewinscale. Nothing like them had ever been seen inRome. The chariot races became more spectacular,thegladiator fightsmore dramatic, asCaesar staged fightsto thedeathamongtheRoman nobility.Heorganizedenormous mock naval battles onanartificial lake. Playswere performedineveryRoman ward. A giantnew theater was built thatsloped dramatically down theTarpeian Rock. Crowds from allover theempireflocked tothese events, theroads to Rome lined with visitors’ tents. And in45B.C.,timing hisentry into thecity formaximum effect andsurprise,Caesar brought Cleopatraback toRome after hisEgyptian campaign,and staged even more extravagant public spectacles. These events were more than devices todivert the masses; theydra~ maticallyenhanced thepublic’ssense ofCaesar’s character, and made him seem larger than life. Caesar was the master ofhispublic image, ofwhich hewasforever aware. When heappearedbefore crowds hewore themost spectacular purplerobes. Hewould beupstaged byno one. He was notori- ouslyvain about hisappearance—itwas said that one reason heenjoyed being honored bytheSenate andpeoplewas that onthese occasions he could wear alaurel wreath, hiding hisbaldness. Caesar was amasterful or- ator. Heknew how tosayalotbysayingalittle, intuited the moment to end aspeechformaximum effect. He never failed toincorporateasurprise into hispublic appearances—a startlingannouncement that would heightentheir drama. Immensely popular among theRoman people,Caesar was hated and
