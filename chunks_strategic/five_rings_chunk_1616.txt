DBSERVANCE OFTHE LAW 11 Inthelate 1920s, civil warbroke outinChina astheNationalist andCom munist parties battled forcontrol ofthecountry. In1927 Chiang Kai—shek, theNationalist leader, vowed tokilleverylastCommunist, and over the next fewyears henearly accomplishedhistask, pushinghisenemies hard until, in1934-1935, heforced them into theLong March, asix-thousand mile retreat from thesoutheast totheremote northwest, throughharsh ter- rain, inwhich most oftheir ranks were decimated. Inlate 1936 Chiang plannedone lastoffensive towipethem out, buthewascaught inamutiny: His own soldiers capturedhim and turned him over totheCommunists. Now hecould only expecttheworst. Meanwhile, however, theJapanese begananinvasion ofChina, and much toChiang’s surprise,instead ofkillinghim theCommunist leader, Mao Tse~tung, proposedadeal: The Communists would lethimgo,and would recognizehim ascommander oftheir forces aswell ashis,ifhe would agreetofight alongsidethem against their commonenemy. Chiang hadexpectedtorture and execution; now hecould not believe hisluck. How soit these Reds had become. Without havingtofightarearguardac- tion against theCommunists, heknew hecould beat theJapanese,and then afewyearsdown theline hewould turn around anddestroytheReds with ease, Hehadnothingtolose andeverythingtogain byagreeingto their terms. The Communists proceededtofight theJapaneseintheir usual fash~ ion, with hit»and-run guerrilla tactics, while theNationalists foughtamore conventional war. Together,alter several years, theysucceeded inevicting theJapanese. Now, however, Chiang finally understood what Mao had re- allyplanned.His ownarmyhad met thebnmt oftheJapanese artillery, wasgreatly weakened, and would take afewyearstorecover. The Com~ munists, meanwhile, had notonly avoided anydirect hits from thejapa~ nese, they had used thetime torecoup their strength,and tospreadout andgainpocketsofinfluence allover China. Assoon asthe waragainstthe Japanese ended, thecivil war started aga.in—but this time theCommunists envelopedtheweakened Nationalists andslowlybeat them into submis- sion. TheJapanese had served asMao’s cat’s-paw, inadvertently ploughing thefields fortheCommunists andmaking possibletheir victoryover Chi- angKai~shel<.
