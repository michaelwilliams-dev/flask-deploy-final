notentirely without foundation in ourunderstanding ofhuman nature. Ifthefamily, which issurely somehow natural, remains theonly object ofloyalty, theclanortribe cannever besurpassed. Tobecome either amember ofacity—ora philosopher— onemustbreak with one'sprimary loyalty. Thebodily or blood tiesarenottheonlything that isnatural toman; noraretheythe most important thing.Mendonotonly lovemembers oftheir family, butalsothosewhom theybelieve tobegood. Nevertheless, amanwho loved thebetter children ofothers more than hisown inferior children would beconsidered monstrous. Theblood tiesbind andhave a morality oftheirownwhich keeps themind fromwandering freely over theworld; theystand inthewayofnatural fulfillment. Men areusually tornbetween duty totheirownandduty tothegood.Thecommunism ofwomen andchildren, bysuppressing family ties, serves toeman- cipate men's loveofthegood. Ifthefamily istobecome thecity,andthecity istobeself- sufficient, themost sacred andawesome ofprohibitions mustbedefied. There mustbeincest inthis city.Bylaw allmembers ofthecityarethe closest ofrelatives, andthey willnotknow their natural relatives. To mostmennothing could seemmore terrible than incest; sopowerful is [385 ] THEREPUBLIC theprohibition against incest that itevenremoves desire where objects ofsatisfaction areclosest athand; itisaccepted without question and hardly needs tobetaught. Thecrime ofOedipus andhistragedy, the archetype oftragedy, concerns thisprohibition. When asked about the problem, Socrates treats itasthough hewere speaking ofregulations no more controversial than those concerning rivers andharbors. Hethus justifies theaccusation ofAristophanes: heistheenemy ofthefamily and itsfundamental principle. Theparticular crime ofOedipus isin- deed prohibited here, butonlybecause heandJocasta would notbeof theproper age forbreeding. When Socrates says that inspecial instances, and iftheDelphic oracle permits, brothers and sisters can wed, heunderstates the case. AsGlaucon sees (463c), Socrates' prescriptions about thefamily actually mean thateverybody inthecity isclosely related; there arenocousins; everyone isatleast thebrother orsister ofeveryone else.Examination ofthemarriage regulations would suggest that itisunlikely thatevenmore serious breaches ofthe incest prohibition canbeavoided inthis city.Therelationships inthe entire citywillbeastangled asthose inthefamily ofOedipus. AndSoc- rates asks fordivine sanction forsuch incestuous loves. Given that there willbemany erotic improprieties inthiscity— asAristotle makes clear {Politics 11,iv)— itseems thatSocrates' approach tothematter is quite light-hearted. What, then, isthisradical policy meant toachieve? Socrates argues thatthecitywillbeone,andthedemon ofprivate, selfish in- terest willbeexorcised. Hecompares thecitytoabody allparts of which share thesame pleasures andpains. This citydoes notattain to thatdegree ofunity, however, foronething cannot bemade public: the body. Everyone's body ishisown.Theminds could conceivably be made tothink similar thoughts (apossibility notsoobnoxious asit sounds; forminds contemplating thesame truths are,forthatmoment andinthatway, thesame). But ifamanstubs histoe,noothermancan share hispain.Thus theunity ofthecitydepends onthatsame forget- tingofthebodywhich hasbeen agolden thread running through the whole discourse. Thebody iswhat stands inthewayofdevotion tothe common good; itisthesource ofthedesire andtheneed forprivacy. Theproblem isthatthebody's demands lead totheestablishment ofan entirewayoflifeandasetofbeliefs contrary tothosewhich would be mostconducive totheperfection ofaman's soulorthepursuit oftruth. Thewayoflifebased onthebody isdirected toacquisition ofthe means ofpreserving andgratifying thebody.The setofbeliefs which protects thatwayoflifeconcerns private property, thefamily, thecivil order, andeven thegods. Although these beliefs onlyserve theselfish [386 ] Interpretive Essay interests related tothebodyanddonotexpress thetruth about nature, they areenormously respectable. Menhold strongly tothem, and it seems very important thattheybemaintained. These beliefs fetter men's minds; they aretheconventions which veilnature. Socrates ishere trying toconstruct apolitical regime which isnot dominated bysuchconventions, oneinwhich philosophy doesnothave tobeaprivate, hidden activity because itcontradicts theauthoritative prejudices. Aristophanes canhelp ustounderstand thecharacter of these prejudices. IntheClouds, Strepsiades bums Socrates' dwelling when hediscovers thatSocrates hadtaught hissonthings which threat- enthesanctity ofthefamily. Only amanwhodidnotcare toomuch about thefamily would beprepared totolerate Socrates' teaching. Soc- rates haselaborated aregime inwhich nocitizen hasafamily and thusnoonecanbeunreasonable inthename ofthefamily.
