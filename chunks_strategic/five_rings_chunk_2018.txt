which showshowthephilosopher appears tothecity.Socrates stays in histhink-tank discussing thenature oftheheavens withunhealthy men. He isgraceless andunprepossessing, aridiculous personage inthe eyesofanyman oftheworld. Hisexperiments innatural philosophy allowhimtobebesmirched bylizards, andhespends histimelooking atgnats, athing nogentleman would do;these insects even infest his clothes. Hedoes notbelieve inthegods ofAthens andhasother ex- traordinary divinities ofhisown;hedraws promising youngmenaway from thepolitical lifeinto hisunusual researches. He isamarginal figurewhoseems bothoddandcorrupt, utterly without common sense. With thispicture ofhimself inmind, Socrates seems tosayhere, "All right, this isthemanwhoshould rule."Heisridiculous inhispretensions andsubversive inhisintentions, thusprovoking reactions oflaughter and anger. Atthispoint inthediscussion, Socrates argues thatphilosophy is needed inthiscity;hedoesnotargue thatphilosophy isthebesthuman activity. Philosophy isnotthetheme ofthediscussion, butjustice, and particularly ajust city. Nevertheless, themostcomprehensive discus- sion ofthecityleads— against thewillofSocrates, asitwere— toa discussion ofphilosophy. Beginning from thecommon sense of political menandmaintaining their perspective throughout, Socrates demonstrates thattheymust tolerate andencourage philosophy. This constitutes adefense ofphilosophy from thepolitical point ofview. Philosophy isnecessary tothisregime, tothebestregime, because without philosophy theregime cannot findimpartial rulerswhohave considered theproper distribution ofthegood things. Inother words, thephilosopher istheonlykind ofknower whose attention isdevoted tothewhole. Statesmen arealways preoccupied withthehere-and-now, buttheinterpretation ofthehere-and-now depends onsomeknowledge ofthewhole. Ifjustice means giving eachmanwhat isfitting forhim, a statesman mustknowwhatman isandhisrelation totheother beings. Inasserting thatphilosophers should rule, Socrates formulates a view oftherelation between wisdom andpower opposed tothatofthe Enlightenment. Beginning from thecommon assumption that knowledge oftheendsofmanand civil society isnecessary tocivil so- ciety, orthatwisdom should rule, thetwoteachings differ astowhether theruleofwisdom requires thatthewise rule.The thinkers ofthe Enlightenment teach thatwisdom canrulewithout philosophers having totake political power; that is,they teach thatthedissemination of knowledge willinevitably lead totheestablishment ofgood regimes. [391 ] THEREPUBLIC Socrates teaches thatwisdom and political power aredistinct. Their coming together canonlybeduetothecoincidence thatamanwho is wisehappens also tobearuler, thusuniting thetwothings; nothing in theirtwonatures leads theonetotheother. Political power serves the passions ordesires ofthemembers ofacity,andamultitude cannot philosophize. Itmayusetheresults ofscience orphilosophy, but itwill usethem toitsownendsandwillthereby distort them. Moreover, the wisemanbyhimself ismore ofathreat toaregime than ahelper. In- tellectual progress isnotthesame aspolitical progress, and,because there isnotasimple harmony between theworks ofthemindandthe works ofthecity, thephilosopher without power must remain inan uneasy relationship with thecityand itsbeliefs. Enlightenment en- dangers philosophy because ittempts philosophers tosacrifice their quest forthetruth infavor ofattempting toedify thepublic; inan "enlightened" world, philosophy risksbeingmade atoolofunwise and even tyrannical regimes, thusgiving those regimes thecolor ofreason andlosing itsfunction asthestandard forcriticism ofthem. Enlighten- ment alsoendangers thecitybypublicly calling intoquestion itsuntrue butessential beliefs. Ifphilosophers cannot rule,philosophy must be disproportionate tothe city.Thismeans that itstruths must remain fundamentally private, andthatthephilosopher, forhisowngoodand thatofthecity,must hide himself. Hemust adapt hispublic teachings tohisparticular situation while keeping histhought free ofits influence. Thephilosopher's public speech mustbeguided byprudence rather than loveofthetruth; hisphilosophic activity seems essentially private. Philosopher-kings are,therefore, truly aparadox. Theformula- tion points upthesalutary effect ofphilosophy inacityandthe necessity ofthecityforphilosophy, hence justifying each totheother; butthehighdegree ofimprobability ofactualization ofthecoincidence ofphilosophers andkings alsopoints uptheenduring tension between philosophy andthecity.The citycannot dowithout philosophy, but it alsocannot quite tolerate philosophy. Socrates expects aspirited attack onhisposition byhisoppo- nents, sohemustprepare hisdefenses. Hebegins bydistinguishing the philosophers from thenonphilosophers. This distinction ismade by referring totwosalient aspects ofthephilosopher. Inthe firstplace, he hasavoracious appetite foralllearning. Hiscuriosity isnotlikethatof acraftsman who learns onlywhat isuseful inthenarrow sense and whose interest islimited byhiscraft.Thephilosopher learns asother menlove— simply because itseems goodandanendinitself; asamat- teroffact, learning isanerotic
