reputation for cruelty. Without this reputation, it is impossible to keep the army united and prevent them from turn.ing to some other faction. Among the noteworthy deeds of Han.nibal (247-183 B.C.), having a large army at his command, should be noted that he never let dissension surface even through he commanded men of very different ages on alien terrain. They didn't bicker among themselves or against their Prince either in THE PRINCE � 95 good or bad fortune. This made him venerated and terrible in the eyes of his soldiers. Without this fear, his other virtues would not have been enough. Historians don't realize this, and while they praise his virtues, they wrongly condemn the source of his strength. That his other virtues would not have sufficed, can be shown by considering Scipio (236-183 B.C., victor over Hannibal), a rare figure in his own times and an exception in all times. In Spain, his army rebelled against him. This came from nothing other than his excessive compassion, which gave his troops more license than military discipline. For this Fabio Massimo reproved him in the Senate and called him a corruptor of the Roman mili.tia. When his Locrensi were destroyed by a false legate and not it vindicated by Scipio or the legate chastised, was because of Scipio's easy nature. So much so that in the Senate some defend.ers who really should have known better, but wanting to excuse him, said he should correct his ways. This nature his would of have in time wrecked Scipio's reputation if he had aspired to be Emperor, but, since he remained loyal under the senate, this dan.gerous virtue of his not only didn't harm him but also added to his glory. I conclude that as being feared loved that being loved to or makes you depend on others while being feared helps you depend on on yourself so that a Prince should rely himself, and not on others. All he needs to do is avoid being hated. HOW A PRINCE SHOULD UPHOLD FAITH E veryone feels that a Prince should keep the Faith and live by honesty and not by astuteness. Nevertheless, one sees that Princes who have done great things in our times have in held the Faith low regard. They have rather by their wits known how to get around men. In the end, they overcame men who remained loyal. There are two ways to fight: with laws, and with force. The first is rightly the man's way; the second is the way of beasts. Of.ten the first way is not enough and it is necessary to resort to the second. A Prince has to know how to manage beasts and men. The ancient writers deal this with Indirectly. They say that Achil.les and many other ancient Princes were given to feeding Chiron the Centaur, whom they kept watch over. This means they held up Chiron as an example of nature, half human and half beast� one without the other was not
