remarks: �To face confusion with composure and face clamor with calm is mastery of heart.� By remaining calm yet alert, uncaptivated and unperturbed, the leader can concentrate mental energies on essential tasks, and not be sidetracked by ambient unrest. Conversely, skillful focus also enables the leader to be that much less distracted and so much the more serene and unruffled. Sun Bin says, �When articulating direction and establishing a standard of measure, only focus on what is appropriate.� This helps to alleviate internal unrest in the ranks by relieving the minds of subordinates from unnecessary concerns; and it also serves to help maintain security by having people usefully occupied while keeping future plans in reserve, to be revealed only at the appropriate time. As Sun Wu describes it, �The affairs of military commanders are kept inscrutable by quiet calm.� The inner inaccessibility of the leader is, of course, strategic, and must not translate into aloofness and unconcern, for then it would endanger rather than safeguard the security of an organization or an operation. As Sun Bin says, �When you know soldiers are trustworthy, don�t let others alienate them.� Even while maintaining a hidden secrecy, the leadership must be intimately acquainted with conditions within and without the organization, as illustrated in the often quoted dictum of Sun Wu, so simple yet so telling: �Knowing others and knowing yourself, victory will not be imperiled.� The meaning of �knowing,� so complex and so critical in the context of strategic thinking, may refer or allude in a given case to any one or more of numerous diverse yet more or less indirectly related phenomena, including information, misinformation, disinformation, and censorship�and, in addition, understanding, misunderstanding, illusion, and deception. The whole science of deliberate construction of these forms and shadows of �knowledge,� and the manipulation of their specific interrelationships, is crucial to tactical action at its most sophisticated level. This is the underlying fact that has given rise to the famous dictum of Sun Wu, which is itself so often misrepresented, misconstrued, and misunderstood, that �Warfare is a path of subterfuge.� Whenever either of the masters Sun involved himself in a discussion of concrete tactics in actual situations, it becomes clear that the notion of warfare as a path of subterfuge, the practice of seizing control of the opponent�s very thoughts and perceptions, underlies the whole science of situational mastery and effective surprise. Sun Wu says, �Make a show of incompetence when you are actually competent, make a show ineffectiveness when you are in fact effective.� Sun Bin elucidates, Let them think you lack resolve, feign lack of ability, and appear to have a defeatist attitude, so as to seduce them into arrogance and laziness, making sure they do not recognize the real facts. Then, on this basis, strike where they are unprepared, attack where they are not defending, pressure those who have slacked off, and attack those who are uncertain or confused. One reason for the use of surprise tactics is that they are ordinarily
