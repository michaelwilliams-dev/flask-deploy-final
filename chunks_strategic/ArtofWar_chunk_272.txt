will be ready and will not suffer harm. The rule is �Once you have prevailed, be as if you had not� (�Sima�s Art of War�). The brief but momentous Qin dynasty (246�207 B.C.E.) put an end to centuries of civil war and unified China for the first time in more than five hundred years. The founder of Qin supplanted the self-cannibalizing feudalism of ancient China with civil bureaucracy and rule of law, unifying both material and intellectual culture in China to an unprecedented degree. The Qin also expanded its influence beyond the realm of ancient China and established the first Chinese empire. The second emperor, who did not have all of his father�s qualities, exhausted the new empire very rapidly with his imperial schemes. Thus there was intense discontent in many parts of China, and the Qin dynasty was overthrown in its second generation by widespread rebellions. One of the leaders of a major peasant uprising sent two of his most powerful allies against strategic Qin positions, and they scored a series of victories over the imperial armies. As a result, the rebel leader began to take the Qin armies lightly, and he became somewhat haughty. Someone advised the rebel leader, �Having prevailed in battle, if the commanders become haughty and the soldiers become lax, they will inevitably suffer defeat. Now your soldiers are getting a bit lazy, while the Qin forces grow by the day. I fear them for your sake.� The rebel leader, however, would not listen. He sent this advisor as an emissary to another state. On the way, this emissary met an ambassador from that very state, and asked him if he were going to see the rebel leader. When the ambassador replied in the affirmative, the emissary of the rebel leader said, �Our leader�s army is now headed for certain defeat; if you go slowly you will escape death, but if you go quickly you will meet disaster.� As it turned out, the imperial Qin forces launched a total assault on the peasant army, inflicting a crushing defeat on the rebels. The leader of the uprising lost his life. Defeat in Battle Liu Ji said: When you are defeated by enemies in battle, do not fear. You should think of how to find benefit in having suffered harm: service your equipment, rouse your soldiers, and watch for the enemy to slack off so that you can attack. Then you will prevail. The rule is �Through injury trouble can be resolved� (Sun Tzu, The Art of War, �Adaptations,� Liu Ji�s own paraphrase). In the early fourth century, there took place the infamous �Riots of the Eight Kings,� civil wars among feudal kings of the Chinese empire under the Jin dynasty. At one point, the king of Hojian sent one of his generals to attack the king of Changsha. The emperor of the Jin dynasty personally sent a force to oppose the Hojian army, but a division of Hojian guerrilla fighters broke through the imperial army. Then
