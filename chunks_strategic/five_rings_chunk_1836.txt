asthey think; rather, thesaying ofThemistocles holds good.When aSeriphian abused him—saying thathewas illustrious notthanks tohimself but 330a thanks tothecity—heanswered that ifhehimself hadbeen aSeriphian hewould nothavemade aname, norwould thatmanhavemade one [5] CEPHALUS/SOCRATIES THEREPUBLIC 330ahadhebeen anAthenian. Andthesame argument alsoholds good for thosewho arenotwealthy andbear oldagewith difficulty: thedecent manwould notbear oldagewithpoverty very easily, norwould theone who isnotadecent sorteverbecontent withhimself even ifhewere wealthy." "Cephalus," Isaid, "didyouinherit ordidyouearnmost ofwhat youpossess?" b "What doyoumean, earned, Socrates!" hesaid. "Asamoney- maker, Iwas asortofmean between mygrandfather andmyfather. Formygrandfather, whose namesake Iam,inherited pretty nearly as much substance asInow possess, andheincreased itmany times over. Lysanias, myfather, used ittoapointwhere itwas still lessthan itis now. Iamsatisfied ifIleave not less, butrather abitmore than I inherited, tomysonshere." "The reason Iasked, yousee," Isaid, "isthat tomeyou didn't cseem overly fond ofmoney. Forthemost part, thosewhodonotmake money themselves arethatway.Thosewhodomake itaretwice asat- tached toitastheothers. Forjust aspoets arefond oftheirpoems and fathers oftheir children, somoney-makers tooare serious about money—astheirownproduct; andthey alsoareserious about itforthe same reason othermen are—foritsuse.They are,therefore, hardeven tobewithbecause they arewilling topraise nothing butwealth." "What yousay istrue," hesaid. d "Indeed itis," Isaid."But tellmesomething more. What doyou suppose isthegreatest good thatyouhave enjoyed from possessing great wealth?" "What Isaywouldn't persuade many perhaps. Forknow well, Socrates," hesaid, "thatwhen amancomes near tothe realiza- tionthathewillbemaking anend, fearandcareenterhim forthings to which hegave nothought before.

Italsohasmany other uses. But, still,onething reckoned against another, Iwouldn't count thisastheleast thing, Socrates, forwhich wealth isvery useful toanin- telligent man." "What yousay isvery fine'^ indeed, Cephalus," Isaid. "But as c tothisvery thing, justice, shallwesosimply assert that itisthetruth andgiving backwhat amanhastaken from another, oristodothese very things sometimes justandsometimes unjust? Take thiscase asan example ofwhat Imean: everyone would surely saythat ifaman takes weapons from afriend when thelatter isofsound mind, andthefriend demands them backwhen he ismad, oneshouldn't giveback such things, andthemanwho gavethem backwould notbejust, and moreover, oneshould notbewilling totellsomeone inthis state the whole truth." "What yousay isright," hesaid. d "Then this isn'tthedefinition ofjustice, speaking thetruth and giving backwhatonetakes." "Itmost certainly is,Socrates," interrupted Polemarchus, "atleast ifSimonides should bebelieved atall." "Well, then,"saidCephalus, "Ihanddown theargument toyou, forit'salready time formetolook afterthesacrifices." "Am Inottheheir ofwhat belongs toyou?" saidPolemarchus.20 "Certainly," hesaidandlaughed.
