were disorderly, he allowed his soldiers to attack, appointing one of his best commanders to lead the vanguard. The enemy troops were routed. A number of tribal leaders were killed, and many thousand mounted warriors surrendered to the Han Chinese. Battling on Good Faith Liu Ji said: In any battle with an opponent, when soldiers face almost certain death without regret or fear, it is trust that makes them that way. When the leadership is trustworthy and honest, followers are earnest and free from doubt; so there is certain victory in battle. The rule is �The trustworthy do not cheat� (�Six Secrets,� �On Generalship�). During the Three Kingdoms era, the king of Wei personally directed an expedition against the kingdom of Shu. He sent a huge force of light troops under cover to proceed in stealth toward Shu. Now Zhuge Liang, minister and general of Shu, had taken up a position in the mountains, guarding the passes with well-equipped troops. He had the troops replaced regularly, keeping a contingent of about one-half to one-third the size of the strike force now advancing from Wei to Shu. The Wei army arrived and set up battle lines just as the Shu guard was in the process of changing. Zhuge�s aides urged him to keep the departing troops there for another month to add their strength to the replacements in face of such a powerful enemy force. Zhuge said, �My command of the military is based on trust and good faith. To lose trust by trying to gain an advantage is a mistake made by men of old. Those who are due to leave pack their gear quickly, waiting for their time to come, while their wives and children stand in their doorways back home, counting the days. Although we are facing a crisis, it will not do to abandon what is right and just.� Thus General Zhuge Liang urged all those whose tour of duty was done to leave the front and return home. Now those who were scheduled to leave were all so pleased by this announcement that they asked to be allowed to stay for one more battle. They stirred up their courage, determined to fight to the death, saying to each other, �Even if we die, that is still not enough to repay the kindness of Master Zhuge.� On the day of battle, everyone in Zhuge�s army rushed forward with drawn sword, each soldier taking on ten of the enemy. They killed one of the Wei leaders, drove off another, and won a great victory in a single battle. This was because of trust and good faith. Instruction and Warfare Liu Ji said: Whenever you want to raise an army, it is necessary first to instruct it in warfare. When the soldiers are trained in ways of scattering and massing, and are thoroughly familiar with the signals for passivity and action, advance and retreat, then when they meet opponents they respond to direction by signals. Then you can do
