it was not.� The fifth element represents the civil leadership, whose authority is the source of the military�s mandate. Since this serves as a general representation of delegation of authority for special purposes, the civil leadership is behind the scenes in �The Army.� The I Ching�s statement, which simply summarizes the logic and ethic of warfare, begins, �When there are vermin in the fields, it is advantageous to denounce them; then there will be no fault.� Cheng Yi understands this to mean eradicating active menaces to society, distinguishing this from acts of tyrannical aggression and paranoia: �The army should be mustered only when aggressors are hurting the people. . . . If it is a case like when vermin get into the fields and damage the crops, and it is justly appropriate to hunt them down, then hunt them down; act in this way and there will be no fault. Act at whim, thus harming the world, and the fault is great indeed. To �denounce� means to make clear what has been done wrong, in order to stop it. Some martial tyrants have scoured the very mountains and forests for those whom they considered �vermin,� but it was not that there were vermin in their own fields.� The I Ching�s statement concludes, �A mature person leads the army; there will be bad luck if there are many immature bosses, even if they are dedicated.� This is a recapitulation of the general doctrine of the I Ching on the importance of wisdom in leadership and unity in organization. Cheng Yi says, �The way to mandate a general to direct an army calls for having a mature person lead the force If a group of immature people boss the army, then even if what they do is right, it will turn out badly.� The need for certain qualities in military leadership and unity in organization is among the first premises of The Art of War, and is a central theme of Zhuge Liang�s writings on generalship. In his essay �Capacities of Commanders,� Zhuge describes the greatest of military leaders in grandiose terms thoroughly consistent with I Ching idealism: �One whose humanitarian care extends to all under his command, whose trustworthiness and justice win the allegiance of neighboring nations, who understands the signs of the sky above, the patterns of the earth below, and the affairs of humanity in between, and who regards all people as his family, is a world-class leader, one who cannot be opposed.� The sixth and final element of the hexagram for �The Army� represents the end of the mission of the armed forces and the reintegration of warriors into civilian society. This can stand symbolically for the absorption of the results of any specialization into the whole body of society. In the context of civil or international warfare, here the I Ching reaffirms both the parallel and the contrast between martial and civil matters, as defined throughout its treatment of this theme. Here, at the end of �The
