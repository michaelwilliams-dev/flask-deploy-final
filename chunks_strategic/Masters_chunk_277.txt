Institute of Languages (SIL)�a Christian organization that trains future missionaries in the linguistic skills that will enable them to translate the Bible into indigenous languages and help spread the Gospel. Everett himself was an ordained minister. The directors at SIL considered Pirah� one of the last frontiers in their quest to translate the Bible into all languages; it represented perhaps the most challenging language for any outsider to learn. The Pirah� had lived for centuries in the same Amazonian basin, resisting all attempts to assimilate or learn Portuguese. Living in such isolation, a point was reached in which no one outside of the Pirah� could speak or understand their language. Several missionaries had been sent there after World War II, and all had failed to make much progress; despite their training and linguistic talents, they found the language maddeningly elusive. Daniel Everett was one of the most promising linguists the SIL had seen in a long time, and when the institute presented him with the challenge of the Pirah� he was more than excited. His wife�s parents had been missionaries stationed in Brazil, and Keren had grown up in an environment not too dissimilar to a Pirah� village. It seemed the family was up to the task, and in his first months there Everett made good progress. He attacked the Pirah� language with great energy. Everett made good progress. He attacked the Pirah� language with great energy. Using the methods he had learned at SIL, he slowly built up a vocabulary and the ability to speak some rudimentary sentences. He copied everything down on index cards and carried them in his belt loop. He was a tireless researcher. Although life in the village presented some challenges for him and his family, he was comfortable with the Pirah� and hoped they had accepted his presence. But soon he began to feel that all was not right. Part of the SIL method was to encourage immersion in the indigenous culture as the best means for learning the language. Missionaries are essentially abandoned to their fate, to sink or swim in the local culture without any crutches to lean on. Perhaps unconsciously, however, Everett could not help but keep some distance and feel ever so slightly superior to the backward culture of the Pirah�. He became aware of this inner distance after several incidents that occurred in the village. First, several months into their stay, his wife and daughter nearly died from malaria. He was rather perturbed by the lack of empathy from the Pirah� about this. A little later, Everett and his wife tried desperately to nurse back to health a Pirah� infant that was gravely ill. The Pirah� were certain the baby would die, and seemed bothered by the missionaries� efforts. Then one day, Everett and his wife discovered the baby was dead; the Pirah� had forced alcohol down its throat to kill it. Although he tried to rationalize this event to himself, he could not help but feel some disgust.
