alive. PART II ORGANIZATIONAL (TEAM) WARFARE5AVOID THE SNARES OF GROUPTHINK: THE COMMAND-AND-CONTROL STRATEGYThe problem in leading any group is that people inevitably have their ownagendas. You have to create a chain of command in which they do not feelconstrained by your influence yet follow your lead. Create a sense ofparticipation, but do not fall into groupthink--the irrationality of collectivedecision making.6SEGMENT YOUR FORCES: THE CONTROLLED-CHAOS STRATEGYThe critical elements in war are speed and adaptability--the ability to move andmake decisions faster than the enemy. Break your forces into independentgroups that can operate on their own. Make your forces elusive andunstoppable by infusing them with the spirit of the campaign, giving them amission to accomplish, and then letting them run.7TRANSFORM YOUR WAR INTO A CRUSADE: MORALESTRATEGIESThe secret to motivating people and maintaining their morale is to get them tothink less about themselves and more about the group.

Sometimes youcan accomplish most by doing nothing.PART IV OFFENSIVE WARFARE12LOSE BATTLES BUT WIN THE WAR: GRAND STRATEGYGrand strategy is the art of looking beyond the battle and calculating ahead.
