Nicwlfr llv1(l(’/ll(l‘U!.‘ll2, 1469 I527 OBSERVANCF. OFTHE LAW Alexander theGreat had adominant passionasayoungman—~an intense dislike forhisfather, King PhilipofMacedonia. Hehated Philip’s cunning, cautious styleofruling,hisbombastic speeches,hisdrinking andwhoring, and hislove ofwrestlingand ofother wastes oftime. Alexander knew he had tomake himself thevery oppositeofhisdomineeringfather: Hewould force himself tobebold andreckless, hewould control histongueand bea man offewwords, and hewould notlose precious time inpursuitofplea- sures thatbroughtnoglory.Alexander also resented thefact thatPhilip hadconqueredmost ofGreece: “Myfather willgoonconqueringtillthere isnothing extraonhnaryleftfor me todo,” he once complained.Vllhile other sons ofpowerfulmen were content toinherit wealth and live alifeof leisure, Alexander wanted onlytooutdo hisfather, toobliterate Philip’s name from history bysurpassinghisaccomplishments. Alexander itched toshow others how superior hewas tohisfather. A Thessalian h0rse»dealer once broughtaprizehorse named Bucephalusto sell toPhilip. None oftheking’s grooms could getnear thehorse—it was fartoosavage——a.nd Philipberated themerchant forbringinghim such a useless beast. Watchingthewhole affair, Alexander scowled and com- mented, “What ahorse theyarelosing forwant ofskill andspirittoman‘ agehim!” When hehad said this several times, Philiphadfinallyhad enough,andchallengedhim totake onthehorse. Hecalled themerchant back, secretly hopinghis sonwould have anastyfa.lland learn abitter les- son. ButAlexander was the one toteach thelesson: Notonlydidhemount Bucephalus,hemanagedtoride him atfullgallop, tamingthehorse that would latercarryhim allthewaytoIndia. The courtiers applauded wildly, butPhilip seethed inside, seeing not asonbut arival tohispower. Alexander’s defiance ofhisfather grew bolder. One daythe two men had aheated argument before theentire court, andPhilip drew hissword asiftostrike his son; havingdrunk too much wine, however, theking stumbled. Alexander pointedathisfather andjeered,“Men ofMacedonia, seethere the man who ispreparingtopass from EuropetoAsia. Hecannot passfrom one table toanother without falling.” When Alexander was eighteen,adisgruntled courtier murdered Philip.Asword oftheregicide spread through Greece, city after cityrose upinrebellion against their Macedonian rulers. Philip’sadvisers counseled Alexander, now theking,toproceed cautiously,todo asPhiliphad done andconquer through cunning.ButAlexander would dothings hisway:He marched tothefurthest reaches ofthekingdom, suppressed therebellious towns, and reunited theempire with brutal efficiency. As ayoungrebelgrows older, hisstruggle against thefather often wanes, and hegraduallycomes toresemble theveryman hehad wanted to defy.ButAlexandefs loathing ofhisfather did notendwith Phi.lip’s death. Once hehad consolidated Greece, hesethiseyesonPersia, theprize that hadeluded hisfather, who had dreamed ofconqueringAsia. Ifhedefeated thePersians, Alexander would finally surpass Philipingloryand fame. Alexander crossed into Asia with anarmy of35,000 toface 3.Persian force numberingover amillion. Before engaging thePersians inbattle he passed throughthe town ofGordium. Here, inthetown’s main temple, there stood anancient chariot tied with cords made oftherind ofthe cor- neltree.
