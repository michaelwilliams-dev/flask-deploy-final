depend upon his, how can you expect me to tell you what mine are?" 1] 7. All warfare is based on deception. 1[1] "Words on Wellington," by Sir. W. Fraser. CHAPTER 2. LAYING PLANS 32 [The truth of this pithy and profound saying will be admitted by every soldier. Col. Henderson tells us that Wellington, great in so many milit- ary qualities, was especially distinguished by "the extraordinary skill with which he concealed his movements and deceived both friend and foe."] 7. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy be- lieve we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near. 8. Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him. [All commentators, except Chang Yu, say, "When he is in disorder, crush him." It is more natural to suppose that Sun Tzu is still illustrating the uses of deception in war.] 7. If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him. 8. If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant. [Wang Tzu, quoted by Tu Yu, says that the good tactician plays with his adversary as a cat plays with a mouse, first feigning weakness and immob- ility, and then suddenly pouncing upon him.] 7. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. [This is probably the meaning though Mei Yao-ch�en has the note: "while we are taking our ease, wait for the enemy to tire himself out." The YU LAN has "Lure him on and tire him out."] If his forces are united, separate them. [Less plausible is the interpretation favored by most of the commentators: "If sovereign and subject are in accord, put division between them."] 7. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected. 8. These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged before- hand. 9. Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought. [Chang Yu tells us that in ancient times it was customary for a temple to be set apart for the use of a general who was about to take the field, in order that he might there elaborate his plan of campaign.] The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand. Thus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: how much more no calcu- lation at all! It is by attention to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose. Chapter 3 WAGING WAR [Ts�ao Kung has the note: "He who wishes to fight must first count the cost," which prepares us for the discovery that the subject of the chapter is not what we might expect from the title, but is primarily a
