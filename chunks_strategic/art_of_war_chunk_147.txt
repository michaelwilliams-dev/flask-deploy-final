advantage of your debility and rise up. Then even if you have wise advisers you cannot make things turn out well in the end. LI QUAN A large-scale operation involves enormous expense, which not only breaks you down in the field, but also exhausts you at home. Therefore a wise government does not keep its army in the field. Master Sun Therefore I have heard of military operations that were clumsy but swift, but I have never seen one that was skillful and lasted a long time. It is never beneficial to a nation to have a military operation continue for a long time. CAO CAO Some win through speed, even if they are clumsy. DU MU Some may be clumsy in attack, but they get the upper hand through extraordinary swiftness, because they are not subject to the problems of wearing out their forces and using up their resources. CHEN HAO As it is said, be swift as the thunder that peals before you have a chance to cover your ears, fast as the lightning that flashes before you can blink your eyes. Master Sun Therefore, those who are not thoroughly aware of the disadvantages in the use of arms cannot be thoroughly aware of the advantages in the use of arms. LI QUAN Advantages and disadvantages are interdependent�first know the disadvantages, then you know the advantages. JIA LIN When the generals are haughty and the soldiers are lazy, in their greed for gain they forget that there may be an unexpected turn of events�this is the greatest disadvantage. DU YOU This means that if you are planning to mobilize your forces and embark upon a campaign, if you do not first think about the calamities of danger and destruction, you will not be able to reap any advantage. Master Sun Those who use the military skillfully do not raise troops twice and do not provide food three times. CAO CAO This means you draft people into service once and then immediately seize victory�you do not go back to your country a second time to raise more troops. At first you provide food, after that you feed off the enemy; and then when your soldiers return to your country, you do not greet them with yet more free food. DU MU Determine whether the enemy can be successfully attacked, determine whether you can do battle, and only afterward raise troops�then you can overcome the enemy and return home. LI QUAN Do not raise troops twice, lest the citizenry become wearied and bitterness arise. Master Sun By taking equipment from your own country but feeding off the enemy you can be sufficient in both arms and provisions. CAO CAO When you are going to go to war, first you must calculate your expenses, and strive to feed off the opponent. LI QUAN If you have your own arms and take food from the enemy, then even if the campaign takes you far afield you will not lack for anything. CAO
