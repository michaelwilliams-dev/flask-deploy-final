whereupon shehadtothrow herself onthe mercy oftheKing ofAragon. True, theVenetians andFlorentines expanded their territory with mercenary arms, andtheir captains didnotbecome Princes, butdefended them —but,inthese cases, they were favored by fate. Some valorous captains, whom theymight fear, didnotwin, THE PRINCE —77 others hadopposition, andstill others directed their ambitions elsewhere. Giovanni Acuto (John Hawkwood, 1320-1394) was notawinner —sohewasnever tested. Buteveryone saidthatif hehadwon hecould have hadFlorence. Sforza inMilan always hadAndrea Fortebracci (1368-1424) against him, holding back each other. Francesco Sforza cast hislotwith Lombardy, while Braccio went against theChurch andtheKingdom ofNaples. Let's look atwhat happened recently. Florence made Paul Vitelli captain, amost prudent man who made abigreputation outofaprivate fortune. Ifhehadsucceeded inPisa, hecould have done thesame inFlorence. Ifhehadbecome their soldier, soldier oftheenemy, Florence would have hadtoobey himtoo. Look atVenice andtheir success. Atfirst, theyadvanced their interests surely andgloriously with their own tactics until they campaigned ontheground. Atseatheysucceeded with their own leaders andpeople, butwhen they launched aground campaign they adopted theItalian useofmercenaries. Atfirst, asagreat citywith little territory, they’d didn't have much tofearfrom their captains. Butinthesecond warwith Milan under Francesco Bur- rone, Count ofCarmagnola, they learned theerror oftheir ways. Lauding himasvirtuous because atfirsthehaddefeated theDuke ofMilan, butknowing how hehadturned, they sawthey could notwinwith Count ofPitigliano andothers who allrisked losing, ashappened atVaila (1509) when Venice lostinonedaygains of eight hundred years. Such arms make gains slowly, late, andfee- bly,andthey aresoon lost. There areexamples from Italy, gov- erned foralong time bymercenary troops, andIdiscuss them at length todefine theorigins andprogress oftheir cases sothat things canbeimproved. Itistobeunderstood, then, how inrecent times with thede- cline ofimperial power inItaly andtheincrease inthetemporal power ofthepapacy, Italy divided intomany states. Many great cities took arms against thenobles who were formerly favored by theEmperor. Thechurch favored thecities because itincreased their own temporal power. Many citizens became Princes. With theChurch rising andsome republics, things were headed by 78— Niccolò Machiavelli priests andcitizens notaccustomed toarms —andthey began to useforeign troops. The first toresort tothissortofmilitia was Alberigo ofConio, from Romagna, who founded in1409 the Company ofSt.George. From hisexample Braccio andSforza followed, both intheir times arbiters ofItaly. After them came theothers who into ourtimes have commanded mercenary ar- mies. Theoutcome ofthiswasthedescent ofCharles ofFrance intoItaly, Louis theXII, andFerdinand ofAragon, allhelped by theSwiss. Their tactic wastoreduce theinfantry. Without astate andin thebusiness ofwar, theinfantry burdened them andwere hard to provide for.Sothey built upthecavalry which were lessnumer- ousbuteasier tosupport. Finally, inanarmy of20,000 soldiers, there were only twothousand infantry. Everything wasdone to reduce thework andfears ofthesoldiers, notmassacring each other buttaking prisoners. They didn't assault cities atnight and thecities didnotlaunch surprise attacks onthetents. There was nocampaigning inwinter. Allthiswaspermitted inthemilitary toescape burdens andhardships tillfinally theItalian military wasweakened andvitiated.
