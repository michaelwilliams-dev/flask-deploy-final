that his alleged introduction to that monarch had already taken place, and of course the 13 chapters must have been written earlier still. But at that time, and for several years after, down to the capture of Ying in 506, Ch�u and not Yueh, was the great hereditary enemy of Wu. The two states, Ch�u and Wu, had been constantly at war for over half a century, 30 whereas the first war between Wu and Yueh was waged only in 510, 31 and even then was no more than a short interlude sandwiched in the midst of the fierce struggle with Ch�u. Now Ch�u is not mentioned in the 13 chapters at all. The natural inference is that they were written at a time when Yueh had become the prime antagonist of Wu, that is, after Ch�u had suffered the great humiliation of 506. At this point, a table of dates may be found useful. 30When Wu first appears in the CH�UN CH�IU in 584, it is already at variance with its powerful neighbor. The CH�UN CH�IU first mentions Yueh in 537, the TSO CHUAN in 601. 31This is explicitly stated in the TSO CHUAN, XXXII, 2. CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 14 B.C. 514 Accession of Ho Lu. 512 Ho Lu attacks Ch�u, but is dissuaded from entering Ying, | the capital. SHI CHI m 511 Another attack on Ch�u. 510 Wu makes a successful attack on Yueh. This is the first war between 508 or 509 Ch�u invades Wu, but is signally defeated at Yu-chang 506 Ho Lu attacks Ch�u with the aid of T�ang and Ts�ai. Decisive battle of Po-chu, and capture of Yi 505 Yueh makes a raid on Wu in the absence of its army. Wu is beaten by Ch�in 504 Ho Lu sends Fu Ch�ai to attack Ch�u. 497 Kou Chien becomes King of Yueh. 496 Wu attacks Yueh, but is defeated by Kou Chien at Tsui-li. Ho L 494 Fu Ch�ai defeats Kou Chien in the great battle of Fuchaio, and enters th 485 or 484 Kou Chien renders homage to Wu. Death of Wu Tzu-hs 482 Kou Chien invades Wu in the absence of Fu Ch�ai. 478 to 476 Further attacks by Yueh on Wu. 475 Kou Chien lays siege to the capital of Wu. 473 Final defeat and extinction of Wu. The sentence quoted above from VI. ss. 21 hardly strikes me as one that could have been written in the full flush of victory. It seems rather to imply that, for the moment at least, the tide had turned against Wu, and that she was getting the worst of the struggle. Hence we may conclude that our treatise was not in existence in 505, before which date Yueh does not appear to have scored any notable success against Wu. Ho Lu died in 496, so that if the book was written for him, it must have been during the period 505-496, when there was a lull in the hostilities, Wu having presumably
