should have gone with the Cardinal Rouen and not he of Rovere. Whoever believes that in great personages new benefices make them forget old injuries is deceived. The Duke made a mis.take in this election and it led to his ruin. OF THOSE WHO COME TO POWER THROUGH VILLAINY us one of hLetizenryare two reinways neithto rise cases,fortune norcedom from the private ci re no neglect these to a Pri virtue them T wh r although plays a part. � the civic Prince � belongs more to a discussion of Republics. I refer here to cases where a man rises to Princedom by nefarious or villainous means, or in the case of the civic Prince, treated in to the next chapter, when a citizen rises power with the help of his fellow citizenry. But speaking of those who rise by nefarious or villainous means, I will show two examples, one ancient, one modern, without arguing the merits of the cases, because in cases of necessity, I judge it simply expedient to imitate them. The Sicilian Agatocle (Tyrant of Syracuse, 317-289 B.C.) not only rose from the citizenry but from infamous and abject fortune to become King of Syracuse. Born of a potter, he lived a bad life. Notwithstanding, he lived his wicked ways with such vigor and fitness that, after joining the militia, he rose Commander to in Chief. Having reached this position, and having decided be- to come Prince by violence and without obligation others to who would block him, and keeping in mind the presence of the Car.thaginian Hamilcar � whose army was in Sicily � he convened the people and senators one morning of Syracuse as if he wanted to consult them about affairs of state. At the sign, his army killed the senators and the richest citizens, clearing his way to take the Principality without civil opposition. Although he was twice de.feated by the Carthaginians and city was assaulted, not only did he succeed in defending the city but, leaving part of his army to hold the fort, with the rest he attacked Hamilcar and in a short time not only liberated Syracuse but chased the Africans out and 60� Niccol� Machiavelli they had to rest content with African bases and leave Syracuse to Agatocle. Whoever considers this life, and Agatocle's actions, will not find much left to fortune; not anyone's favor was Agatocle by helped, but by military intervention beset by many inconven.iences and dangers. This was brought him to power and main.tained his Principality. Nor can one say it was virtue when he killed citizens, betrayed friends, walked without faith, without pi.ety, and without religion. By this means, he could achieve power but not glory. Still, if you consider Agatocle's virtue in facing and overcoming danger, and his greatness in facing and overcoming obstacles, there is nothing by which to judge him worse than any good Captain. Despite his extreme cruelty and inhumanity and his wickedness, he stands among great-celebrated men. But this cannot
