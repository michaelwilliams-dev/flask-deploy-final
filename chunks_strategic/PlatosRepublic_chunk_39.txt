right, let that be settled for us; but we did say that injustice is mighty as well. Or don't you remember, Thrasymachus?" "I remember," he said. "But even what you're saying now doesn't satisfy me, and I have something to say about it. But if I should speak, I know well that you would say that I am making a public harangue. So then, either let me say as much as I want; or, if you want to keep on questioning, go ahead and question, and, just as with old wives who tell tales, I shall say to you, 'All right,' and I shall nod and shake my head." "Not, in any case, contrary to your own opinion," I said. "To satisfy you," he said, "since you won't Jet me speak. What else do you want?" "Nothing, by Zeus," I said, "but if that's what you are going to do, go ahead and do it. And I'll ask questions." "Then ask." "I ask what I asked a moment ago so that we can in an orderly fashion make a thorough consideration of the argument about the 35,1 character of justice as compared to injustice. Surely it was said that in- justice is more powerful and mightier than justice. But now," I said, 345. a b C d e "if justice is indeed both wisdom and virtue, I believe it will easily come to light that it is also mightier than injustice, since injustice is lack of learning-no one could still be ignorant of that. But, Thrasy? machus, I do not desire it to be so simply considered, but in this way: would you say that a city is unjust that tries to enslave other cities unjustly, and has reduced them to slavery, and keeps many enslaved to itself?" "Of course," he said. "And it's this the best city will most do, the one that is most perfectly unjust." "I understand," I said, "that this argument was yours, but I am considering this aspect of it: will the city that becomes stronger than another have this power without justice, or is it necessary for it to have this power with justice?" "If," he said, "it's as you said a moment ago, that justice is wisdom-with justice. But if it's as I said-with injustice." "I am full of wonder, Thrasymachus," I said, "because you not only nod and shake your head, but also give very fine answers." "It's because I am gratifying you," he said. "Ifs good of you to do so. But gratify me this much more and t ll me: do you believe that either a city, or an army, or pirates, or robbers, or any other tribe which has some common unjust enterprise would be able to accomplish anything, if its members acted unjustly to one another?" "Surely not," he said. "And what if they didn't act unjustly? Wouldn't they be more able to accomplish something?" ï¿½ "Certainly," he said. "For surely, Thrasymachus, it's injustice that produces factions, hatreds,
