"I,too,joinyou insupposing that," hesaid, "atleast intheway I can." "Come, then," Isaid, "and joinmeinsupposing this, too,and don'tbesurprised thatthemenwho gettothatpoint aren't v^dlling to mind thebusiness ofhuman beings, butrather that their souls are al- dways eager tospend their timeabove. Surely that's likely, ifindeed this, too,follows theimage ofwhich Itoldbefore." "Ofcourse it'slikely," hesaid. "Andwhat about this?Doyousuppose itisanything surprising," Isaid, "ifaman,come from actsofdivine contemplation tothehuman evils, isgraceless andlooks quite ridiculous when—with hissight still dimandbefore hehasgotten sufficiently accustomed tothesurround- ingdarkness—heiscompelled incourts orelsewhere tocontest about theshadows ofthejust ortherepresentations ofwhich they arethe eshadows, and todispute about thewaythese things areunderstood by menwhohavenever seen justice itself?" "It'snotatallsurprising," hesaid. 518a "But ifamanwere intelligent," 1said,"hewould remember that there aretwokinds ofdisturbances oftheeyes, stemming from two sources—^when theyhavebeen transferred from light todarkness and when theyhavebeen transferred from darkness tolight.And ifheheld thatthesesame things happen toasoul too,whenever hesawone that isconfused andunable tomake anything out,hewouldn't laugh [196 ] BookVU /517a-519b socrates/glaucon without reasoning butwould goontoconsider whether, come from a 518a brighter life, itisindarkness forwant ofbeing accustomed, orwhether, going from greater lackoflearning togreater brightness, itisdazzled bythegreater brilliance.

"What yousay isquite sensible," hesaid. "Then, ifthis istrue," Isaid,"wemust hold thefollowing about :these things: education isnotwhat theprofessions ofcertain men assert ittobe.They presumably assert thattheyputintothesoulknowledge that isn't init,asthough theywere putting sight intoblind eyes." c "Yes," hesaid,"they doindeed assert that." "But thepresent argument, ontheother hand," Isaid, "indicates that thispower isinthesoulofeach,^ andthattheinstrument with which each learns—just asaneye isnotable toturntoward thelight from thedarkwithout thewhole body—must beturned around from thatwhich iscoming intobeing together with thewhole soul until itis able toendure looking atthatwhich isandthebrightest partofthat which is.Andweaffirm that this isthegood, don'twe?" d "Yes." "There would, therefore," Isaid, "beanartofthis turning around, concerned with theway inwhich thispower canmost easily and efficiently beturned around, notanartofproducing sight in it. Rather, this arttakes asgiven that sight isthere, butnotrightly turned norlooking atwhat itought tolook at,andaccomplishes thisobject." "So itseems," hesaid. "Therefore, theother virtues ofasoul, asthey arecalled, areprob- ablysomewhat close tothose ofthebody.
