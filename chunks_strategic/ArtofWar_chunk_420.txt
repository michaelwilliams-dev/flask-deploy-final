Wei Liao (4th cent. B.C.), who stud- ied under the famous Kuei-ku Tzu. The work appears to have been originally in 31 chapters, whereas the text we possess contains only 24. Its matter is sound enough in the main, though the strategical devices differ considerably from those of the Warring States period. It is been furnished with a commentary by the well-known Sung philosopher Chang Tsai. 5. SAN LUEH, in 3 CHUAN. Attributed to Huang-shih Kung, a legendary personage who is said to have bestowed it on Chang Liang (d. 187 B.C.) in an interview on a bridge. But here again, the style is not that of works dating from the Ch�in or Han period. The Han Emperor Kuang Wu [25-57 A.D.] apparently quotes from it in one of his proclamations; but the passage in question may have been inserted later on, 73See XIII. ss. 27, note. Further details on T�ai Kung will be found in the SHIH CHI, ch. 32 ad init. Besides the tradition which makes him a former minister of Chou Hsin, two other accounts of him are there given, according to which he would appear to have been first raised from a humble private station by Wen Wang. 26 BIBLIOGRAPHY 27 in order to prove the genuineness of the work. We shall not be far out if we refer it to the Northern Sung period [420-478 A.D.], or somewhat earlier. 1. LI WEI KUNG WEN TUI, in 3 sections. Written in the form of a dialogue between T�ai Tsung and his great general Li Ching, it is usually ascribed to the latter. Com- petent authorities consider it a forgery, though the author was evidently well versed in the art of war. 2. LI CHING PING FA (not to be confounded with the foregoing) is a short treatise in 8 chapters, preserved in the T�ung Tien, but not published separately. This fact explains its omission from the SSU K�U CH�UAN SHU. 3. WU CH�I CHING, in 1 CHUAN. Attributed to the legendary minister Feng Hou, with exegetical notes by Kung-sun Hung of the Han dynasty (d. 121 B.C.), and said to have been eulogized by the celebrated general Ma Lung (d. 300 A.D.). Yet the earliest mention of it is in the SUNG CHIH. Although a forgery, the work is well put together. Considering the high popular estimation in which Chu-ko Liang has always been held, it is not surprising to find more than one work on war ascribed to his pen. Such are (1) the SHIH LIU TS�E (1 CHUAN), preserved in the YUNG LO TA TIEN; (2) CHIANG YUAN (1 CHUAN); and (3) HSIN SHU (1 CHUAN), which steals wholesale from Sun Tzu. None of these has the slightest claim to be considered genuine. Most of the large Chinese encyclopedias contain extensive sections devoted to the literature of war. The following references may be found useful: T�UNG TIEN (circa 800 A.D.), ch. 148-162. T�AI P�ING YU LAN (983), ch. 270-359. WEN HSIEN TUNG K�AO (13th
