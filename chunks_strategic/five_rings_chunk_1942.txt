wasn't it?" "Yes." "And thenthegreediness forwealth andtheneglect oftherest for thesake ofmoney-making destroyed it." "True," hesaid. "And does thegreediness forwhatdemocracy defines asgood also dissolve it?" "What doy6usay itdefines thatgood tobe?" "Freedom," Isaid."For surely inacityunder ademocracy you c would hear that this isthefinest thing ithas,andthat forthis rea- son itistheonlyregime worth living inforanyone who isbynature free." "Yes indeed," hesaid, "that's anoften repeated phrase." [240 ] BookVIII /561c-563c socrates/adeimantus "Then," Isaid, "asIwasgoing tosayjustnow, does theinsatiable 562c desire ofthisandtheneglect oftherestchange thisregime andprepare aneed fortyranny?" "How?" hesaid. "Isuppose thatwhen ademocratic city,once it'sthirsted forfree- dom, getsbadwinebearers asitsleaders andgetsmore drunk than it d should onthisunmixed draught, then, unless therulers arevery gentle andprovide agreat dealoffreedom, itpunishes them, charging them withbeing polluted andoligarchs." "Yes," hesaid, "that's what they do." "And itspatters withmud thosewho areobedient, alleging that they arewilling slaves oftherulers andnothings," Isaid, "while it praises andhonors— both inprivate andinpublic— therulerswho are liketheruledandtheruledwho areliketherulers. Isn't itnecessary in such acitythatfreedom spread toeverything?" e "How could itbeotherwise?" "And,myfriend," Isaid, "for ittofilterdown totheprivate houses andendupbyanarchy's being planted inthevery beasts?" "How dowemean that?" hesaid. "That afather," Isaid, "habituates himself tobelikehischildand fear hissons,andasonhabituates himself tobelikehisfather andto havenoshame before orfearofhisparents— that's sohemaybefree; andmetic isonanequal level withtownsman andtownsman with metic, andsimilarly with theforeigner."^^ 563a "Yes," hesaid, "that's what happens." "These andother small things ofthefollowing kindcome to pass," Isaid."Astheteacher insuch asituation isfrightened ofthe pupils andfawns onthem, sothestudents make light oftheir teachers, aswell asoftheir attendants. And, generally, theyoung copy their el- dersandcompete withthem inspeeches anddeeds while theoldcome down tothelevel oftheyoung; imitating theyoung, they areoverflow- ingwith facility andcharm, and that's sothattheywon't seem tobe b unpleasant ordespotic." "Most certainly," hesaid. "And theultimate inthefreedom ofthemultitude, myfriend," I said, "occurs insuch acitywhen thepurchased slaves, male and female, arenolessfreethan thosewhohavebought them.Andweal- most forgot tomention theextent ofthelawofequality andoffreedom intherelations ofwomen withmenandmenwithwomen." "Won't we,"hesaid, "with Aeschylus, 'saywhatever justcame to c our lips'?"24 "Certainly," 1said, "Ishalldojust that.Amanwho didn't have [241 ] socrates/adeimantus therepublic 563c theexperience couldn't bepersuaded oftheextent towhich beasts sub- ject tohuman beings arefreer herethan inanother city.Thebitches follow theproverb exactly andbecome like their mistresses;^^ and ofcourse, therecome tobehorses andasseswhohave gotten thehabit ofmaking theirwayquite freely andsolemnly, bumping intowhomever theyhappen tomeetontheroads, ifhedoesn't stand aside, and allelse d issimilarly fulloffreedom." "You're telling memyown dream," hesaid. "I,myself, re- peatedly suffer thatvery thingwhen journeying tothecountry." "Then, summing upallofthese things together," Isaid,"doyou noticehowtender theymake thecitizens' soul, sothat ifsomeone pro- poses anything thatsmacks inanywayofslavery, they areirritated and can't stand it?Andtheyendup,asyouwellknow, bypaying noatten- tiontothelaws, written orunwritten, inorder thattheymayavoid hav- e inganymaster atall." "Ofcourse, Iknow it,"hesaid. "Well, then,myfriend," Isaid, "this isthebeginning, sofairand heady, fromwhich tyranny inmyopinion naturally grows." "Itsurely isaheady beginning," hesaid, "but what's next?" "Thesame disease," Isaid, "asthatwhich arose intheoligarchy anddestroyed it,arises alsointhisregime—^butbigger andstronger as aresult ofthelicense—andenslaves democracy. And, really, anything that isdone toexcess islikely toprovoke acorrespondingly great change intheopposite direction— inseasons, inplants, inbodies, and, 564a inparticular, notleast inregimes." "That's probable," hesaid. "Toomuch freedom seems tochange intonothing buttoomuch slavery, both forprivate manand city." "Yes, that's probable." "Well, then," Isaid, "tyranny isprobably established outofno other regime thandemocracy, Isuppose— thegreatest andmost savage slavery outoftheextreme offreedom." "Yes," hesaid, "that's reasonable." "But Isuppose youweren't asking that," Isaid, "but rather
