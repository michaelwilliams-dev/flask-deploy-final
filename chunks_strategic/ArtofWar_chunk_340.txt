purpose of this selectivity, of course, is not to fulfill the ambitions of individuals irrespective of the welfare of the group, but to enhance the internal harmony and therefore survival value of the organization, as Sun Bin explains: On the one hand, �If their orders are not carried out and their troops are not unified, commanders can be beaten�; while on the other hand, Sun Bin also adds, When flowing water finds a course, it can even wash away boulders and snap boats in two; when people are employed in a manner consistent with their nature, then orders are carried out like a flowing current. The qualifications of leadership and the requirements of order apply, moreover, to every step on the chain of command, from the top commander in charge of the whole group to the individual in charge of personal performance. Sun Wu said, Those who press forward without ambition for fame and retreat without trying to avoid blame, who only care for the security of the people and thus are in harmony with the interests of the social order, they are treasures of the nation. Subordination of selfish ambition or personal vanity to the welfare of the group does not deny but rather affirms the worth of the individual, because the proper combination of teamwork and individual responsibility is what gets the job done. The same basic principles are also echoed by Sun Bin: Acting with integrity is a rich resource for warriors. Trust is a distinguished reward for warriors. Those who despise violence are warriors fit to work for kings. In addition to character and organizational ability, the capacity for intelligent planning is essential to leadership. In the words of Sun Wu: �Those who do not know the plans of competitors cannot enter capably into preliminary negotiations.� Skill in tactical thinking is considered normal for leaders�not a product of cunning artifice, but a natural application of intelligence to the realities of life as it is. Sun Bin explains it this way: Fangs and horns, claws and spurs, harmonizing when pleased, fighting when angry�these are in the course of nature, and cannot be stopped. Therefore those who have no natural defenses plan strategically for themselves; this is the business of wise leaders. The essence of strategic thinking, the pivot on which tactical action revolves, is situational adaptation, as indicated by the elder master, Sun Wu: �Leaders who have mastered the advantages of comprehensive adaptation to changes are those who know how to command militias.� It is this ability to adapt to changes, furthermore, that allows the warrior to remain unruffled in the midst of chaotic upheaval, as Sun Wu observes: �Masters of military affairs move without confusion, mobilize without exhaustion.� In this way the actions and measures taken by the leader can be based on objective response to the situation, unaffected by subjective emotions, unfazed by the pressures of the moment, as Sun Bin says: �Let nothing seduce you, let nothing anger you.� The elder master, Sun Wu,
