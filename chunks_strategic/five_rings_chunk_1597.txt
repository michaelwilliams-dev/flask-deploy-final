Ofthefivebrothers, Nathan hadalready opened upshop inLon- don. In1813 Jamesmoved toParis. Amschel remained inFrankfurt, Salomon established himself inVienna, andKarl, theyoungest son, went toNaples. With each sphereofinfluence covered, theycould tightentheir hold onEurope’sfinancial markets. This widespread network, ofcourse, openedtheRothschilds tothe verydangerofwhich their father had warned them: diliusion, division, dis- sension. Theyavoided thisdanger, and established themselves asthemost powerfulforce inEuropeanfinance andpolitics, byonce again resortingto thestrategyoftheghetto-——excluding outsiders, concentrating their forces. The Rothschiids established thefastest couriersysteminEurope, allowing them togetnews ofevents before alltheircompetitors. Theyheld avirtual monopolyoninformation.
