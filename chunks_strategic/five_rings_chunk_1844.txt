"ByZeus, Idon't think it,"hesaid. "Iknow itwell." "But, Thrasymachus," Isaid,"what about theother kinds ofrule? Don't younotice thatnoonewishes torule voluntarily, butthey de- mand wages asthough thebenefit from ruling were notforthembutfor thosewho areruled?Now tellmethismuch: don'twe,atallevents, al- 346a ways saythateach ofthearts isdifferent onthebasis ofhaving adif- ferent capacity? And don't answer contrary toyour opinion, you blessed man, sothatwecanreach aconclusion." "Yes," hesaid, "this isthewaythey differ." "And doeseach ofthem provide uswithsome peculiar^J benefit andnotacommon one, asthemedical artfurnishes uswith health, the pilot's artwith safety insailing, andsoforth with theothers?" "Certainly." "And does thewage-earner's artfurnish wages? For this isits b power. Ordoyou callthemedical artthesame asthepilot's art?Or, if youwish tomake precise distinctions according totheprinciple youset down, even ifamanwho isapilotbecomes healthy because sailing on thesea isadvantageous tohim, nonetheless youdon't forthatreason callwhat hedoes themedical art?" "Surely not,"hesaid. [23 ] socrates/thrasymachus/glaucon therepublic 346b "Nordoyou, Isuppose, callthewage-earner's artthemedical art, even ifamanwho isearning wages should behealthy?" "Surely not,"hesaid. "And, what about this?Doyou callthemedical artthewage- earner's art,even ifaman practicing medicine should earnwages?" c Hesaidthathedidnot. "Andwedidagree thatthebenefit ofeach art ispeculiar?" "Let itbe,"hesaid. "Then whatever benefit allthecraftsmen derive incommon is plainly derived from their additional useofsome onecommon thing that isthesame forall." "Itseems so,"hesaid. "Andwesaythatthebenefit thecraftsmen derive from receiving wages comes tothem from their useofthewage-earner's artinaddi- tion." Heassented with resistance. d "Then thisbenefit, getting wages, isforeach notaresult ofhis ov^Ti art;but, ifitmustbeconsidered precisely, themedical artpro- duces health, andthewage-earner's artwages; thehousebuilder sart produces ahouse and thewage-earner's art,following upon it, wages; and soitiswith alltheothers; each accomplishes itsown work andbenefits thatwhich ithasbeen setover.And ifpaywere notattached toit,would thecraftsman derive benefit from theart?" e "Itdoesn't look like it,"hesaid- "Does hethenproduce nobenefit when heworks fornothing?" "Isuppose hedoes." "Therefore, Thrasymachus, itisplainbynow thatnoartorkind ofruleprovides for itsown benefit, but, aswehavebeen saying all along, itprovides forandcommands theonewho isruled, considering hisadvantage —thatoftheweaker—andnotthatofthestronger. Itis forjust thisreason, mydearThrasymachus, that 1saidamoment ago thatnoonewillingly chooses toruleandgetmixed upinstraightening outother people's troubles; butheasks forwages, because theman 347awho istodoanything finebyartnever doeswhat isbest forhimself nor doeshecommand it,insofar asheiscommanding byart,butrather what isbest forthemanwho isruled. Itisforjust thisreason, asit seems, thattheremustbewages forthosewhoaregoing tobewilling to rule—either money, orhonor, orapenalty ifheshould notrule." "What doyoumean bythat, Socrates?" saidGlaucon. "The first twokinds ofwages Iknow, but Idon't understand what penalty you mean andhowyoucansay itisakind ofwage." [24 ] Book I/346b-348a socrates/glaucoi "Then youdon't understand thewages ofthebestmen," Isaid, 3471 "onaccount ofwhich themost decent men rule,when they arewilHng torule.Ordon'tyouknow thatlove ofhonor andlove ofmoney are said tobe,and are,reproaches?" "Idoindeed," hesaid. "For thisreason, therefore," Isaid, "thegood aren't willing to rule forthesake ofmoney orhonor. Forthey don't wishopenly toex- actwages forruling andgetcalled hirelings, norontheirown secretly totake aprofit from their ruling andgetcalled thieves. Nor, again, will they rule forthesake ofhonor. Forthey arenotlovers ofhonor. Hence, necessity andapenalty mustbethere inaddition forthem, if theyaregoing tobewilling torule— itislikely that this isthesource of itsbeing held tobeshameful toseek toruleandnottoawait necessity— andthegreatest ofpenalties isbeing ruledbyaworseman ifone isnotwilling torule oneself.
