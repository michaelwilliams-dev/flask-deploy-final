There were tyrannies among them, some last- ing to the end, others ruined midway, ending both in poverty and exile and in beggary. And there were lives of men of repute-some for their forms and beauty and for strength in general as well as capacity in cont sts; others for their birth and the virtues of their ancestors-and b there were some for men without repute in these things; and the same was the case for women, too. An ordering of the soul was not in them, due to the necessity that a soul become different according to the life it chooses.
