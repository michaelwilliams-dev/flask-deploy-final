Inthedecoyand redherringdevices discussed in Part I,youactively distract people;inthesmoke screen, youlullyourvic- tims, drawingthem intoyour web. Because itissohypnotic,this isoften thebestway ofconcealing yourintentions. Thesimplest form ofsmoke screen isfacial expression. Behind abland, unreadable exterior, allsorts ofmayhemcanbeplanned,without detection. This isaweaponthat themost powerfulmen inhistoryhave learned toper- fect. Itwas said that noone could read Franklin D.Roosevelfs face. Baron jamesRothschild made alifelong practice ofdisguisinghisrealthoughts be hind bland smiles andnondescriptlooks. Stendhal wrote ofTalleyrand, “Never was aface lessofabarometer.” Henry Kissinger would bore hisop— ponentsaround thenegotiating table totears with hismonotonous voice, hisblank look, hisendless recitations ofdetails; then, astheireyes glazed over, hewould suddenlyhitthem with alistofbold terms. Caughtoff» guard, theywould beeasily intimidated. As onepokermanual explains it, “While playinghishand, thegood playerisseldom anactor. Instead he practicesabland behavior that minimizes readable patterns,frustrates and confuses opponents, permits greaterconcentration,” Anadaptable concept,thesmoke screen can bepracticedon anum- beroflevels, allplayingonthepsychological principlesofdistraction and misdirection. One ofthe most effective smoke screens isthe noblegesture. Peoplewant tobelieve apparently noble gesturesaregenuine, forthebelief ispleasant. They rarely notice how deceptivethese gesturescan be. The artdealerjoseph Duveen was once confronted with aterrible prob- lem. The millionaires who hadpaidsodearlyforDuveen’s paintingswere runningoutofwall space, andwith inheritance taxes gettingever higher,it seemed unlikelythatthey would keep buying. The solution wastheNational Gallery ofArtinWashington, D.C., which Duveen helpedcreate in1937by getting Andrew Mellon todonate hiscollection toit.The National Gallery was theperfect front forDuveen. Inone gesture, hisclients avoided taxes, cleared wallspacefor new purchases,and reduced thenumber ofpaintings onthemarket, maintaining theupward pressureontheir prices. Allthis while thedonors created theappearance ofbeing publicbenefactors. Another effective smoke screen isthepattern, theestablishment ofase riesofactions that seduce thevictim intobelieving youwill continue inthe same way. Thepattern playsonthepsychology ofanticipation: Our behav~ iorconforms topatterns,orsowelike tothink. In1878 theAmerican robber baronjay Gould created acompanythat began tothreaten themonopoly ofthetelegraph companyWestern Union. The directors ofWestern Union decided tobuy Gould’scompany up- theyhad tospendahefty sum, butthey figured theyhadmanagedtorid themselves ofanirritating competitor.Afewmonths later, though,Gould wasitatagain, complaininghehad been treated unfairly. Hestartedupa second companytocompetewith Western Union and itsnew acquisition. The same thing happened again:Western Union bought him out toshut himup.Soon thepattern began forthethird time, but now Gould went for thejugular: Hesuddenly stagedabloodytakeover struggleandmanaged togain complete control ofWestern Union. Hehad established apattern that had tricked thecompany’sdirectors intothinking hisgoalwas tobe boughtout atahandsome rate. Once theypaidhim off,they relaxed and failed tonotice that hewasactually playing forhigher stakes. The patternis powerfulinthat itdeceives theotherpersonintoexpecting theopposite of whatyouarereally doing. Anotlier psychologicalweakness onwhich toconstruct asmoke screen isthetendencytomistakeappearances forreality-——the feeling thatifsome- one seems tobelongtoyour group,their belongingmust bereal. This habit makes theseamless blend averyeffective front. The trick issimple:You sim« plyblend inwith those aroundyou.The betteryoublend, the lesssuspi- cious youbecome. DuringtheCold War ofthe 1950s and ’60s, asisnow notorious, aslew ofBritish civil servants passedsecrets totheSoviets.
