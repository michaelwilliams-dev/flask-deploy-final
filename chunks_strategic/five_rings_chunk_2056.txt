"Inodheradistant greeting because I ampure." 23.Theword for"obey" means "to listen to";here theScholiast remarks thatnowthecitywill"listen instead ofbeing listened to."Thiscon- stitutes anadditional condition tothepossibility ofthegood citythathadnot previously beenmentioned; forthisreason some scholars havebeen ledtoal- terthepassage, but itpoints toanimportant difficulty (cf473c-d). 24.Theword isdynasteia, derived from thewordmeaning "power." It isused here incontrast tokingship, which implies alegitimate exercise of political rule.Dynasteia isachiefdom, freefromanyofthelimitations orad- vantages oflegitimacy. Itisclassed byAristotle with tyranny orunlimited democracy, regimes without laws inwhich thesovereign candoasitwishes {Politics, 1242b). In473d theword translated bychiefwasdynastes. (Cf. Laws, 680a— b,where theregime oftheCyclopes iscalled adynasteia.) 25.Or,"their arguments arealways adhominem." Literally, "about hu- man beings." 26.Demotike, belonging tothedemos, thepeople atlarge, the citizen body inademocracy. 27.Theword andreikelon alsomeans "aflesh-colored pigment." 28.Another possible reading would betranslated asfollows: "Or will someone assert thatthosemenwhomweexcluded aremore so?" 29.Cf341b. 30.Ourword "narcotic" comes from therootoftheGreek word (cf Meno, 80b). 31.Inthepreceding passage theword for"interest," tokos, alsomeans "offspring." Hence there isanurbane playonmoney andreproduction, natural andconventional. Aristotle explains thedouble sense oftokos asfollows: Usury ishated withgood reason because ofitsbeing acquisition from currency itselfandnotfrom that forwhich currency ispro- vided. Forcurrency came intobeing forthesake ofexchange. The tokosmakes itmore.And itisfrom thatthat itgot itsname. Foras [463 ] inn. n 11.jfu£>L,1Li theoffspring areliketheparents, sotokos breeds currency from currency. And inthisway itisofthekinds ofmoneymaking the most contrary tonature. {Politics, 1258b.) 32.Literally, "themost sun-formed." 33.TheGreek means, literally, "tosaysomething good" or"touse words ofgoodomen." Itisprimarily aword appropriate toreligious observ- ance; itsopposite is,literally, "blasphemy," andthat iswhat istobeavoided. Itisbetter tosaynothing, rather than touseunpropitious expressions. 34.TheGreek wordmeans "age," and itgetsthesense "dignity" be- cause ofthehonor orright belonging toage. 35.Thegenitive forrri oftheword forvisible, horatou, is,intheGreek orthography, very close tothat forheaven, ouranou. The lastsyllable of ouranou isidentical with thegenitive oftheword forintelligence (nous), which istherootoftheword forintelligible {noeton). (Cf.494dandnote 13; 614bandnote 13).There is,hence, aplayonthewords forheaven" and visi- ble;and, inaddition, thequestion israised, onthebasis ofthewords, astothe relation oftheheavens totheintelligible world (cf.528e ff.).According to CratyUis (396c), theastronomers saythatoiiranos received itsname from in- telligence, andrightly so. 36.Theword translated as"beginning" can alsoberendered as "starting-point," "principle" or"cause"; similarly, "end" canbe"conclusion" or"result." 37.Anhypothesis is,literally, "aplacing under," andshould perhaps be rendered as"supposition" (cf.Meno, 86 ff.,andPhaedo, 99d ff.). 38.Or,another possible rendering:".. .thebeginning which isthe whole." 39.Theword iseikasia, derived from theverbmeaning "tomake an image." "Imagination" waschosen inorder topreserve itsrelation to"image" (eikon), which plays suchanimportant role intheRepublic andonalllevels ofthedivided line.Theimportance ofthisfaculty would beobscured ifthis connection were notobvious. Forthebest discussion ofeikasia, andofthe divided lineasawhole, cf.Jacob Klein,ACommentary onPlato's Meno (Uni- versity ofNorth Carolina Press, 1965), pp.115 ff.
