each group had spent seven days in the plain, on the eighth they were made to depart from there and continue their journey. In four days they arrived at a place from which they could see a straight light, like a column, stretched from above through all of heaven and earth, most of all resembling the rainbow but brighter and purer. They came to it after having moved forward a day's journey. And there, at the middle of the light, they saw the extremities of its bonds stretched from heaven; for this light is that which binds heaven, like the undergirders of triremes, thus holding the entire revolution together. From the extremities stretched the spindle of Necessity, by which a1l the revolutions are turned. Its stem and hook are of adamant, and its whorl is a mixture of this and other kinds. The nature of the whorl is like this: its shape is like those we have here; but, from what he said, it must be conceived as if in one great hollow whorl, completely scooped out, lay another like it, but smaller, fitting into each other as bowls fit into each other; and there is a third one like these and a fourth, and four others. For there are eight whorls in all, lying in one another with their rims showing as circles from above, while from the back they 615 C d e 616 a b C d e 16. e form one continuous whorl around the stem, which is driven right ï¿½ through the middle of the eighth.15 Now the circle formed by the lip of the first and outermost whorl is the broadest; that of the sixth, sec? ond; that of the fourth, third; that of the eighth, fourth; that of the sev? enth, fifth; that of the fifth, sixth; that of the.third, seventh; and that of the second, eighth. And the lip of the largest whorl is multicolored; that 17. a of the seventh, brightest; that of the eighth gets its color from the sev? enth's shining on it; that of the second and the fifth are like each other, yellower than these others; the third has the whitest color; the fourth is reddish; and the sixth is second in whiteness. The whole spindle is turned in a circle with the same motion, but within the revolving whole the seven inner circles revolve gently in the opposite direction from the whole; of them, the eighth goes most quickly, second b. and together with one another are the seventh, sixth and fifth. Third in swiftness, as it looked to them, the fourth circled about; fourth, the third; and fifth, the second. And the spindle turned in the lap of Necessity. Above, on each of its circles, is perched a Siren, accompany? ing its revolution, uttering a single sound, one note; from all eight is produced the accord of a single harmony. Three others are seated c. round about at equal distances, each on a throne. Daughters
