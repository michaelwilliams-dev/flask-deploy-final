THE PRINCE � 85 in two ways: he gets to know his own country the better to defend it, but also gets to know terrain and what to expect about other and new places. The lakes, valleys, plains, and rivers and swamps of Tuscany are similar to those of other places. What one learns in one province applies to another. A Prince who lacks this skill lacks the first thing needing in a Captain. All this helps in finding the enemy, pitching camp, leading the troops, settling the order of the day, and staking sites to your advantage. Pelopomene, Prince of the Acheans, among virtues attributed to of him by writers, was that of thinking nothing but war in times of peace. Often if he was the country with friends he in would stop them and say; "If the enemy were on that hill, and we were here with the army, who would have the advantage? How would we advance meet the enemy? If we wanted retreat to to which way would we go? They would go over all the possibili.ties, hear opinions, express their own, then test them. So it was by continued practice that the Prince, when leading the army, never lacked a solution in any circumstance. As to mental preparation, a Prince must ever read history and examine the records of excellent men, the reasons for victory and defeat � to better achieve the one and avoid the other. He should study some excellent man to imitate those who have been praised and glorified, borrowing his gestures and actions, as Alexander the Great imitated Achilles, Ceasar imitated Alexander, and Scipio imitated Cyrus. Whoever reads the life of Cyrus written by Xenofantes (430-354 B.C.) realizes how much in life Scipio owed to imitation � chastity, affability, humanity, and liberality. In all this Scipio followed what Xenofantes writes about Cyrus. A wise Prince will do likewise. He will never be lazy in peacetime but will be industrious in preparing to have all ready in times of adversity so that, when fortune changes, he can meet it and resist. CONCERNING MEN'S PRAISE, ITS CAUSES, ESPECIALLY FOR PRINCES, AND THEIR CONDEMNATION W needwrithis consider of a Perstillincehavewith toen the mode governing of subjects and friends. I know many oth. a lot about this, so I fear I will be held presumptuous by departing from what others have said about the matter. But since my intent is write something useful to to the reader, I plan to go behind appearances and posturing and deal with the effective reality of things. Many states have pretended to be Republics or Principalities that were nothing of sort. the There's a big difference between how one actually lives and how one should ideally live. Often one who strays from what he actu.ally does and what he should ideally do risks ruin. He who wants always to do good often wrecks himself among those who are not good. Wherefore it behooves a Prince who wants to maintain
