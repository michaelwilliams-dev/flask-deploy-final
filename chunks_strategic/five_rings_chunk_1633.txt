Attheage ofeight,Ivan was now adespised orphan,andanyboyarorfamilymem- berwho took aninterest inhim wasimmediately banished orkilled. And soIvan roamed thepalace, hungry,illclothed, and often inbid ingfrom theShuiskys,who treated himroughlywhen theysaw him. On some days theywould search him out, clothe him inroyal robes, hand him a.scepter,and sethim onthethrone——a kind ofmock ritual inwhich they lampoonedhisroyal pretensions.Then theywould shoo himaway. One eveningseveral ofthem chased theMetropolitan———thehead oftheRussian chu;rch—through thepalace,and hesought refugeinIvan’s room; theboy watched inhorror astheShuiskys entered, hurled insults, and beat the Metropolitan mercilessly.

Then they banished Vorontsov from Moscow. Throughoutallthis Ivan maintained astrict silence.

But ontheevening ofDecember 29,I543, Ivan, now thirteen, asked Prince Andrei Shuiskytocome tohis room. When theprince arrived, the room was filled with palace guards. YoungIvan then pointedhisfingerat Andrei and ordered theguardstoarrest him, have him killed, and throw hisbodytothebloodhounds intheroyalkennel.
