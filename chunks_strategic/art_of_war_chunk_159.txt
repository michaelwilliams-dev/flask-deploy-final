you can, falling back when you know there is an impasse. To talk about government orders for all this is like going to announce to your superiors that you want to put out a fire�by the time you get back with an order, there is nothing left but the ashes. DU MU Du Mu quoted Wei Liaozi, saying, �The general is not controlled by heaven above, is not controlled by earth below, is not controlled by humanity in between. This is why �the military is an instrument of ill omen.� The general is an officer of death.� Master Sun So it is said that if you know others and know yourself, you will not be imperiled in a hundred battles; if you do not know others but know yourself, you win one and lose one; if you do not know others and do not know yourself, you will be imperiled in every single battle. LI QUAN If you assess your strength and can fend off opponents, what danger is there? If because of your own strength you fail to measure opponents, then victory is uncertain. DU MU Compare your government to that of the enemy; compare your military leadership to that of the enemy; compare your logistics to that of your enemy; compare your ground to that of your enemy. Having established these comparisons, you will have a preview of superiorities and inferiorities, weaknesses and strengths; this will enable you to prevail every time in subsequent military operations. ZHANG YU When you know others, then you are able to attack them. When you know yourself, you are able to protect yourself. Attack is the time for defense, defense is a strategy of attack. If you know this, you will not be in danger even if you fight a hundred battles. When you only know yourself, this means guarding your energy and waiting. This is why knowing defense but not offense means half victory and half defeat. When you know neither the arts of defense nor the arts of attack, you will lose in battle. [ 4 ] Formation DU MU You see the inner conditions of opponents by means of their external formations. The inner condition of the formless is inscrutable, whereas that of those who have adopted a specific form is obvious. The inscrutable win, the obvious lose. WANG XI Those skilled in military operations are able to change their formations in such a way as to ensure victory based on the actions of opponents. ZHANG YU This means the offensive and defensive formations used by two armies. When they are hidden within, they cannot be known to others; when they are visible without, opponents can come in through the chinks. Formation is revealed by attack and defense, so discussion of formation follows the discussion of planning a siege. Master Sun In ancient times skillful warriors first made themselves invincible, and then watched for vulnerability in their opponents. ZHANG YU Making yourself invincible means knowing yourself; waiting for vulnerability
