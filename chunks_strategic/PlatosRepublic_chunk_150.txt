other leaders of cities than these." "How shall we do it?" "About philosophic natures, let's agree that they are always in love with that learning which discloses to them something of the being that is always and does not wander about, driven by generation and de? cay." "Yes, let's agree to that." "And, further," I said, "that just like the lovers of honor and the erotic men we described before, they love aU of it and don't willingly let any part go, whether smaller or bigger, more honorable or more contemptible." "What you say is right," he said. "WeU, next consider whether it is necessary in addition that those who are going to be such as we were saying have this further charac? teristic in their nature." "What?" "No taste for falsehood; that is, they are completely unwilling to admit what's false but hate it, while cherishing the truth." "It's likely," he said. "It's not only likely, my friend, but also entirely necessary that a Book VI I 484c-486b SOCRATES/GLAUCON man who is by nature erotically disposed toward someone care for everything related and akin to his boy."1 "Right," he said.

"So, when in someone they have flowed toward learning and all that's like it, I suppose they would be concerned with the pleasure of the soul itself with respect to itself and would forsake those pleasures that come through the body-if he isn't a counterfeit but a true philosopher." ''That is most necessary." "Such a man is, further, moderate and in no way a lover of mon? . ey. Money and the great expense that accompanies it are pursued for the sake of things that any other man rather than this one is likely to take seriously." "That's so." "And you too must of course also consider something else when you're going to judge whether a nature is philosophic or not." "What?" "You mustn't let its partaking in illiberality get by yott unnoticed. For petty speech is of course most opposite to a soul that is always going to reach out for the whole and for everything divine and hu? man." "Very true," he said. "To an understanding endowed with magnificence2 and the con? templation of all time and all being, do you think it possible that hu? � �. man life seem anything great?"
