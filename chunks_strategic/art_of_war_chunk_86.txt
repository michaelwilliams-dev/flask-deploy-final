the former was sent to attempt the life of the King of Ch�in (afterwards First Emperor) in 227 B.C. The tears of all flowed down like rain as he bade them farewell and uttered the following lines: "The shrill blast is blowing, Chilly the burn; Your champion is going�Not to return." 1 ] But let them once be brought to bay, and they will display the courage of a Chu or a Kuei. [Chu was the personal name of Chuan Chu, a native of the Wu State and contemporary with Sun Tzu himself, who was employed by Kung-tzu Kuang, better known as Ho Lu Wang, to assassinate his sovereign Wang Liao with a dagger which he secreted in the belly of a fish served up at a banquet. He succeeded in his attempt, but was immediately hacked to pieced by the king�s bodyguard. This was in 515 B.C. The other hero referred to, Ts�ao Kuei (or Ts�ao Mo), performed the exploit which has made his name famous 166 years earlier, in 681 B.C. Lu had been thrice defeated by Ch�i, and was just about to conclude a treaty surrendering a large slice of territory, when Ts�ao Kuei suddenly seized Huan Kung, the Duke of Ch�i, as he stood on the altar steps and held a dagger against his chest.

Huan Kung, in peril of his life, was obliged to consent, whereupon Ts�ao Kuei flung away his dagger and quietly resumed his place amid the terrified assemblage without having so much as changed color. As was to be expected, the Duke wanted afterwards to repudiate the bargain, but his wise old coun- selor Kuan Chung pointed out to him the impolicy of breaking his word, and the upshot was that this bold stroke regained for Lu the whole of what she had lost in three pitched battles.] 29. The skillful tactician may be likened to the SHUAI-JAN. Now the SHUAI- JAN is a snake that is found in the Ch�ang mountains. 1Giles� Biographical Dictionary, no. 399. CHAPTER 12. THE NINE SITUATIONS 102 ["Shuai-jan" means "suddenly" or "rapidly," and the snake in question was doubtless so called owing to the rapidity of its movements. Through this passage, the term in the Chinese has now come to be used in the sense of "military maneuvers."] Strike at its head, and you will be attacked by its tail; strike at its tail, and you will be attacked by its head; strike at its middle, and you will be attacked by head and tail both. 30. Asked if an army can be made to imitate the SHUAI-JAN, [That is, as Mei Yao-ch�en says, "Is it possible to make the front and rear of an army each swiftly responsive to attack on the other, just as though they were part of
