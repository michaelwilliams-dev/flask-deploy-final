change what we set down at the beginning. For I'm afraid we didn't set down the definition of friend and enemy correctly." "How did we do it, Polemarchus?" "We set down that the man who seems good is a friend." "Now," I said, "how shall we change it?" "The man who seems to be, and is, good, is a friend," he said, "while the man who seems good and is not, seems to be but is not a friend. And we'll take the same position about the enemy." 334 b C d e 335 a 335 a "Then the good man, as it seems, will by this argument be a friend, and the good-for-nothing man an enemy?" "Yes " "you order us to add something to what we said at first about the just. Then we said that it is just to do good to the friend and bad to the enemy, while now we are to say in addition that it is just to do good to the friend, if he is good, and harm to the enemy, ifhe is bad." b. "Most certainly," he said. "Said in that way it would be fine in my opinion." "Is it, then," I said, "the part of a just man to harm any human � being whatsoever?"

"Impossible." � "Are men skilled in horsemanship able to make men incompetent riders by horsemanship?" "That can't be." "But are just men able to make others unjust by justice, of all b. things? Or, in sum, are good men able to make other men bad by vir? tue?" "Impossible." "For I suppose that cooling is not the work of heat, but of its op- posite." "Yes." "Nor wetting the work of dryness but of its opposite." "Certainly." "Nor is harming, in fact, the work of the good but of its opposite." "It looks like it." "And it's the just man who is good?" "Certainly." "Then it is not the work of the just man to harm either a friend or anyone else, Polemarchus, but of his opposite, the unjust man." "In my opinion, Socrates," he said, "what you say is entirely true." "Then if someone. asserts that it's just to give what is owed to each man-and he understands by
