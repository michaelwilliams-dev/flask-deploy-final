well therefore, even at the cost of our pride, to have such a scapegoat, such a target for unlucky undertakings. cl Know to get your Price for Things. Their intrinsic value is not su.cient; for all do not bite at the kernel or look into the interior. Most go with the crowd, and go because they see others go. It is a great stroke of art to bring things into repute; at times by praising them, for praise arouses desire at times by giving them a striking name, which is very useful for putting things at a premium, provided it is done without a.ectation. Again, it is generally an inducement to profess to supply only connoisseurs, for all think themselves such, and if not, the sense of want arouses the desire. Never call things easy or common: that makes them depreciated rather than made accessible. All rush after the unusual, which is more appetising both for the taste and for the intelligence. Think beforehand. To-day for to-morrow, and even for many days hence. The greatest foresight consists in determining beforehand the time of trouble. For the provident there are no mischances and for the careful no narrow escapes. We must not put o. thought till we are up to the chin in mire.

The more he does so, the less desirable a companion he is. The more he excels in quality the more in repute: he will always play �rst �ddle and you second. If you get any consideration, it is only his leavings. The moon shines bright alone among the stars: when the sun rises she becomes either invisible or imperceptible. Never join one that eclipses you, but rather one who sets you in a brighter light. By this means the cunning Fabula in Martial was able to appear beautiful and brilliant, owing to the ugliness and disorder of her companions. But one should as little imperil oneself by an evil companion as pay honour to another at the cost of one's own credit. When you are on the way to fortune associate with the eminent; when arrived, with the mediocre. Beware of entering where there is a great Gap to be �lled. But if you do it be sure to surpass your predecessor; merely to equal him requires twice his worth. As it is a �ne stroke to arrange that our successor shall cause us to be wished back, so it is policy to see that our predecessor
