ANAPPEAL TOTAKE BACK ITALY AAND LIBERATE HER FROM THE BARBARIANS llsaidanddone, andthinking about anew Prince forIt- alymanandcouldifmattersdohonorresttonowhimselfsothatandaprudentpopulace andofvirtuous Italy, it seems tomethatthetimes areright foranew Prince —infact, I know ofnobetter time. AsIsaid, thetimes areripe. One need only think ofMoses during thesubjection ofhispeople inEgypt; ofCyrus, when theMedes enslaved thePersians; andofTheseus, when Athens wasweak —soitisnow, ripeforthevirtue ofan Italian spirit. Italy toohasfallen intohercurrent piteous state — more abject than theHebrews, more enslaved than thePersians, more strung outthan theAthenians, without aleader, without or- der, conquered, exploited, wounded, weakened, andvisited by every sortofdevastation. Although wehave seen some sparks here andthere seemingly favored byGod forItaly's redemption. Inthecourse ofevents, we have seen thatsuch hopes were damned byfortune. Without life, Italy awaits someone tohealherwounds, toputanendtotheran- sacking ofLombardy, totheFrench partitioning ofthekingdom andrape ofTuscany, andtoheal thelong festering wounds. See how Italy prays toGod forsomeone tostaunch thecruelty and theInsolence ofthebarbarians. You seehow Italy isready tofol- lowanyflagthat' willsave her. Nor isanyone insight better than your Excellency's house (House ofMedici), which vaunts both fortune andvirtue, thefa- vorofGod andChurch, ofwhich youarenow Prince totake on thistask. Itcannot besodifficult ifyoufollow theworthy lives andactions described above. Such men were exceptional and 132—Niccolò Machiavelli marvelous, butthey were men. Each ofthem seized alesser op- portunity than youhave now. Their cause was nomore justor easier, norwere they more befriended byGod. Great truth liesin thissaying: "That warisjustwhich isnecessary; those arms are sacred without which there isnoother hope." (Titus Livius, His- tories, IX,1).Here liesagreat dispensation —andwhere agreat dispensation lies, there cannot begreat difficulty. The Medici House canrisetotheoccasion ifitfollows theguidelines Ihave setout.Furthermore, aswith Moses, miracles happen: theseas divide; acloud hides thearmies; astone pours water; manna falls from heaven; everything favors thehero. Therestisuptoyou. God does notwant todoeverything nortears from usfreewill andthatpartofglory thatbelongs tous. Itisnosurprise thatsome oftheworthy Italians mentioned were notabletoachieve what ishoped from theillustrious House ofMedici. Nor thatfrom themany revolutions inItaly andthe maneuvers ofwaritseems thatmilitary virtue isdead. This hap- pened because theancient orders ofItaly nolonger sufficed and nooneemerged who could initiate new ones. Nothing honors a new man ontherisemore than thenew laws andways hecan find. Such achievements, when well grounded andgrandly de- signed, make himrevered andrespected. Italy does notlack in Ingenuity. Hermembers have iteven when itislacking inher Chiefs. Justlook atthedeeds andbattles oftheoutnumbered few, when Italians show superior force, skill andingenuity. Only when itcomes toarmies arethey lacking. Itallhangs onthewitness of thechiefs. Those who areintheknow arenotobeyed. Itseems as ifeverybody isintheknow because there isnotonewho stands out,onvirtue oronfortune, towhom theothers might bow. Be- cause ofthis, foralong time inthemany wars ofthepast, for twenty years theItalian army hasalways done poorly.
