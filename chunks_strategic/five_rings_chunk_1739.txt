One ofMao’s favorite books was thevery popularme dieval Chinese novel 77:: Water Margin, which recounts theexploits ofa Chinese Robin Hood and hisrobber band asthey struggle againstacor- rupt andevil monarch. InChina inMao’s time, family tiesdominated over any other kind, fortheConfucian hierarchyoffather and oldest son re- mained firmlyinplace;but The Witter Margin preachedasuperior value- thefraternal tiesoftheband ofrobbers, thenobility ofthe cause that unites people beyondblood. The novel had great emotional resonance forChi~ nese people,who love toroot fortheunderdog.Time and again, then, Mao would present hisrevolutionary armyasanextension oftherobber band inTheI'V1terMargz'n, likening hisstruggletothetimeless conflict be- tween theoppressed peasantryand anevilemperor.Hemade thepast seem toenvelopandlegitimizetheCommunist cause; thepeasantrycould feelcomfortable with and even supportagroupwith such roots inthepast. Even once thePartycame topower,Mao continued toassociate itwith thepast.Hepresented himself tothe masses not asaChinese Lenin but as a.modem Chuko Liang,the real»life third-century strategistwho figures prominentlyinthepopularhistorical novel The Romance oftheWtree King~ dams. Liangwas more than agreat general—hewas apoet,aphilosopher, and afigure ofstem moral rectitude. SoMao represented himself asapoet- wanior like Liang,aman who mixedstrategywith philosophyand preachedanew ethics. Hemade himselfappearlike ahero from thegreat Chinese tradition ofwarrior statesmen. Soon, everythinginMao’s speechesandwritings had areference toan earlier periodinChinese history.Herecalled, forexample,thegreatEm- peror Ch’in, who had unified thecountryinthethird centuryB.C. Ch’in hadburned theworks ofConfucius, consolidated andcompleted thebuild- ingoftheGreat Wall, andgiven his name toChina, Like Ch’in, Mao also hadbrought thecountry together, and hadsought bold reforms againstan oppressive past. Ch’in hadtraditionally been seen asaviolent dictator whose reignwas short; thebrilliance ofMao’s strategywas toturn this around, simultaneously reinterpreting Ch’in, justifyinghisrule intheeyes ofpresent-day Chinese, andusing him tojustifytheviolence ofthe new order that Mao himself wascreating. After thefailed Cultural Revolution ofthelate 1960s, apower struggle LAW 45 395 396‘LAW 45emergedintheCommunist Partyinwhich Mao’s main foe was LinPiao, once aclose friend ofhis.Tomake clear tothe masses thedifference be- tween hisphilosophyandLin’s, Mao once again exploitedthepast:He cast hisopponentasrepresenting Confucius, a.philosopherLin infact would constantly quote. And Confucius signified theconservatism ofthe past. Mao associated himself, ontheother hand, with theancient philo- sophicalmovement known asLegalism, exemplified bythewritings of Han—fei~tzu. TheLegalists disdained Confucian ethics; theybelieved inthe need forviolence tocreate anew order. They worshiped power.Togive himself weightinthestruggle, Mao unleashed anationwide propaganda campaign against Confucius, usingthe issues ofConfucianism versus Le- galism towhiptheyounginto akind offrenzied revolt againsttheolder generation. This grand context envelopeda.rather banalpower struggle, and Mao once againwon over the masses andtriumphedover hisenemies. Interpretation Nopeoplehad amore profoundattachment tothepastthan theChinese. Intheface ofthis enormous obstacle toreform, Mada strategywassimple: Instead ofstruggling againstthepastheturned ittohisadvantage,associ~ atinghisradical Communists with theromantic figures ofChinese history. Weavingthestory oftheWar oftheThree Kingdoms into thestruggle be- tween theUnited States, theSoviet Union, andChina, becast himself as Chuko Liang.Astheemperors had, hewelcomed thecultlike adoration of the masses, understandingthat the Chinese could notfunction without some kind offather figuretoadmire.
