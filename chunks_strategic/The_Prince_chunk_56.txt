or state. Further, he needs, at different times of the year, to occupy the populace with feasts and spectaculars. Since every city is divided in quarters and guilds, he has to cultivate them and sometimes visit them, and exemplify humanity and munificence to them. Always he should cultivate his personal majesty and dignity. This should never be lacking in anything. ON SECRETARIES THE PRINCE SHOULD HAVE NEAR HIM Theyimportancethought to a Prince is the selection of his ministers. O first will be good bad according his choice. His or to is to select persons close to him. If they are capable and loyal, it is always wise to tap them because the prince knows them and commands their loyalty. But if they are not capable, their selection will reflect badly on his reputation. This is the first error he makes. Those who knew Antonio da Venafro (Antonio Giordani, Minister Siena, 1502-1512), Pandolfo Petrucci's minister, of praised him as a valiant man for selecting such a minister. There are three types of ministerial mind: first, those who un.derstand themselves; second, those who perceive what others in.tend; third, those who understand neither themselves nor others. The first kind make excellent ministers, the second kind make excellent ministers, the third kind are useless. Pandolfo himself, though is not the first kind; luckily, he was the second kind � by understanding the good or bad of what others said, even though he did not know himself, he could judge whether a minister acted rightly or not. He could advance and correct others. Nor could a minister hope to fool him and stay in office. How can a Prince evaluate a minister? The following guide.line never fails: when a minister thinks more of himself than of you and looks always for his own advantage you can be sure: a) he won't be a good minister and b) you can't trust him. Whoever is engaged by the state should never think of himself but of the Prince. His first concern should be what concerns the Prince. On the other side, the Prince should, to curry the minister, think of him, honor him, make him rich, obligate him himself, and to shower the minister with honors and offices so that he cannot do THE PRINCE � 119 without the Prince, and so that he need not desire other honors and other riches, and his task and offices make him wary of to changing things. When things are thus arranged, minister Prince, and Prince to minister, they can confide in and cooperate with each other. Any other relation will be harmful to both. HOW TO ESCAPE FLATTERERS should mention an important problem that Princes can only avoidflattererswith theadulators � and utmost prudence or with discretion. I speak of the courts are full of them. Since men indulge their own persons, and deceive themselves, it is hard to defend oneself against this weakness. If one does defend one.self, there is a risk of not being popular. The only way
