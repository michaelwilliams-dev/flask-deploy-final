"If a general is ignorant of the principle of adaptability, he must not be entrus- ted with a position of authority." Tu Mu quotes: "The skillful employer of men will employ the wise man, the brave man, the covetous man, and the stupid man. For the wise man delights in establishing his merit, the brave man likes to show his courage in action, the covetous man is quick at seizing advantages, and the stupid man has no fear of death."] 1. But when the army is restless and distrustful, trouble is sure to come from the other feudal princes. This is simply bringing anarchy into the army, and flinging victory away. 2. Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory: (1) He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight. [Chang Yu says: If he can fight, he advances and takes the offensive; if he cannot fight, he retreats and remains on the defensive. He will invari- ably conquer who knows whether it is right to take the offensive or the defensive.] 2. He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces. [This is not merely the general�s ability to estimate numbers correctly, as Li Ch�uan and others make out. Chang Yu expounds the saying more sat- isfactorily: "By applying the art of war, it is possible with a lesser force to defeat a greater, and vice versa. The secret lies in an eye for locality, and in not letting the right moment slip. Thus Wu Tzu says: �With a su- perior force, make for easy ground; with an inferior one, make for difficult ground.�"] 2. He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks. 3. He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unpre- pared. 4. He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign. [Tu Yu quotes Wang Tzu as saying: "It is the sovereign�s function to give broad instructions, but to decide on battle it is the function of the general." It is needless to dilate on the military disasters which have been caused by undue interference with operations in the field on the part of the home gov- ernment. Napoleon undoubtedly owed much of his extraordinary success to the fact that he was not hampered by central authority.] CHAPTER 4. ATTACK BY STRATAGEM 42 1. Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. [Li Ch�uan cites the case of Fu Chien, prince of Ch�in, who in 383 A.D. marched with a vast army against the Chin Emperor. When warned not to despise an enemy who could command the services of such men as Hsieh An and Huan Ch�ung, he boastfully replied: "I have the population of eight provinces at
