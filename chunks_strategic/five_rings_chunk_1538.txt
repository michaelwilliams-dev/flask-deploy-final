Hehad seen acouple ofhefty ship’s masts inashipyardinAthens afewdays before, and heordered that the larger ofthese besent tohimimmediately.Themilitary engineerinAthens who received theorder felt certain that the consul reallywanted the smaller ofthe masts. Heargued endlessly with thesoldiers who delivered therequest:The smaller mast, hetoldthem, was much better suited tothe task. And indeed itwould beeasier totransport. The soldiers warned theengineerthat their master was not aman to argue with, butheinsisted that thesmaller mast would betheonlyone that would work with amachine that hewasconstructingtogowith it.Hedrew diagram after diagram, and went sofar astosaythat hewas theexpertand they had noclue whattheywere talking about. The soldiers knew their leader and atlastconvinced theengineer that itwould bebetter toswallow hisexpertiseandobey. After they left,though,theengineer thought about itsome more. What was thepoint,heasked himself, inobeyinganorder thatwould lead tofail- ure? And sohesent thesmaller mast, confident that theconsul would see how much more effective itwas and reward himjustly. When thesmaller mast arrived, Mucianus asked hissoldiers for anex- planation. They described tohim how theengineerhadargued endlessly forthesmaller mast, buthadfinally promisedtosend thelargerone. Mu- cianus went into arage. Hecould not concentrate onthesiege,orconsider theimportanceofbreachingthewalls before thetown received reinforce» merits. Allhecould think about was theimpudent engineer, whom heor- dered tobebroughttohimimmediately. Arrivingafewdays later, theengineer gladly explainedtotheconsul, one more time, the reasons forthesmaller mast Hewent onand on,using the same argumentshehad made with thesoldiers. Hesaid itwas wise to listen toexpertsinthese matters, andiftheattack wasonly tried with the batteringram hehad sent, theconsul would notregret itMucianus lethim finish, then
