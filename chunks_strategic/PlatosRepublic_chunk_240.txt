on the outside an image of one-that of the human being-so that to the man who's not able to see what's in? side, but sees only the outer shell, it looks like one animal, a human being." "The outer mold is in place," he said. "Then let's say to the one who says that it's profitable for this hu? man being to do injustice, and that ifs not advantageous for him to do just things, that he's affirming nothing other than that it is profitable for him to feast and make strong the manifold beast and the lion and what's connected with the lion, while starving the human being and making him weak so that he can be drawn wherever either of the others 589 leads and doesn't habituate them to one another or make them friends but lets them bi_te and fight and devour each other." "That," he said, "is exactly what would be meant by the man who praises doing injustice."

"In my opinion," he s_aid, "he doesn't know it at all."

Will he agree or not?" "He will, if he's persuaded by me," he said. "Is it possible," I said, "on the basis of this argument, that it be profitable for anyone to take gold unjustly if something like this hap? pens: he takes the gold and at the same time enslaves the best part of d. himself to the most depraved? Or, if he took gold for enslaving his son or daughter, and to savage and bad men, it wouldn't have profited him no matter how much he took for it; now if he enslaves the most divine
