was really a coward!" he pursued him and began crossing the river in his turn. Han Hsin now sent a party to cut open the sandbags, thus releasing a great volume of water, which swept down and prevented the greater portion of Lung Chu�s army from getting across. He then turned upon the force which had been cut off, and annihilated it, Lung Chu himself being amongst the slain. The rest of the army, on the further bank, also scattered and fled in all directions.] 1. If you are anxious to fight, you should not go to meet the invader near a river which he has to cross. [For fear of preventing his crossing.] 1. Moor your craft higher up than the enemy, and facing the sun. [See supra, ss. 2. The repetition of these words in connection with water is very awkward. Chang Yu has the note: "Said either of troops marshaled on the river-bank, or of boats anchored in the stream itself; in either case it is essential to be higher than the enemy and facing the sun." The other commentators are not at all explicit.] Do not move up-stream to meet the enemy. [Tu Mu says: "As water flows downwards, we must not pitch our camp on the lower reaches of a river, for fear the enemy should open the sluices and sweep us away in a flood. Chu-ko Wu- hou has remarked that �in river warfare we must not advance against the stream,� which is as much as to say that our fleet must not be anchored below that of the enemy, for then they would be able to take advantage of the current and make short work of us." There is also the danger, noted by other commentators, that the enemy may throw poison on the water to be carried down to us.] So much for river warfare. CHAPTER 10. THE ARMY ON THE MARCH 77 1. In crossing salt-marshes, your sole concern should be to get over them quickly, without any delay. [Because of the lack of fresh water, the poor quality of the herbage, and last but not least, because they are low, flat, and exposed to attack.] 1. If forced to fight in a salt-marsh, you should have water and grass near you, and get your back to a clump of trees. [Li Ch�uan remarks that the ground is less likely to be treacherous where there are trees, while Tu Mu says that they will serve to protect the rear.] So much for operations in salt-marches. 1. In dry, level country, take up an easily accessible position with rising ground to your right and on your rear, [Tu Mu quotes T�ai Kung as saying: "An army should have a stream or a marsh on its left, and a hill or tumulus on its right."] so that the danger may be in front, and safety lie behind. So much for campaigning in flat country. 1. These are the four useful branches of military
