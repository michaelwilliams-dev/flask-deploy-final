Adeiman? tus, but only some drones with feet stingless while others have terrible stings? From the stingless ones come those who end up as beggars in old age, while from those who have stings come all who are called wrongdoers." "Very true," he said. "It's plain, therefore," I said, "that in a city where you see beg? gars, somewhere in the neighborhood thieves, cutpurses, temple rob? bers, and craftsmen of all such evils are hidden." "It is plain," he said. "What then? In cities under oligarchies don't you see beggars present?" "Just about everyone except.the rulers," he said. "Aren't we to suppose," I said, "that there are also many wrongdoers witq stings among them, whom the ruling offices diligently hold down by force?" "We must certainly suppose so," he said. "Shall we assert that such men arise there as a result of want of education, bad rearing, and a bad arrangement of the regime?" :c fjJook VIII I 552a-553e ADEIMAN'TIJs/socRATES "We shall assert it." "Well, anyhow, such would be the city under an oligarchy and it . would contain all these evils, and perhaps even more." ï¿½ "That's pretty nearly it," he said. "Then let's take it," I said, "that we have developed the regime called oligarchy, one that gets its rulers on the basis of a property assessment, and next let's consider how the man similar to it comes into being and what he's like once he has come into being."

He had either been a general or had held some other great ruling office, and then got entan- gled with the court-suffering at the hands of sycophants-and under- went death, exile, or dishonor12 and lost his whole substance." "That's likely/' he said. "And the son, my friend, seeing and suffering this and having lost his substance, is frightened, I suppose, and thrusts love of honor and spiritedness headlong out of the throne of his soul; and, humbled by c poverty, he turns greedily to money-making; and bit by bit saving and working, he collects money. Don't you suppose that such a man now puts the desiring and money-loving part on the throne, and makes it the great king within himself, girding it with tiaras, collars, and Persian swords?"13 "I do," he said. "And, I suppose, he makes the calculating and spirited parts sit by d it on the ground on C:ither side and be slaves, letting the one neither cal- culate about nor consider anything but where more money will come from less; and letting the other admire and honor nothing but wealth and the wealthy, while loving the enjoyment of no other
