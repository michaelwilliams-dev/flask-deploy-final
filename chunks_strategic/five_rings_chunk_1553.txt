stratagem.” The cun— ning Greek leader Odysseusthen cameupwith theidea ofbuilding agiantwooden horse, hidingsoldiers inside it, then offering ittothe Trojansas agift. Neoptolemus,son of Achilles, wasdisgusted with this idea; itwas unmanly. Better for thousands todie onthe battlefield than togain victorysodeceitfully. But thesoldiers, faced with achoice between another ten years of manliness, honor, and death, onthe one hand and aquick victoryon theother, chose the horse, which waspromptlybuilt. The trick was successful andTroyfell. Onegiftdid more fortheGreek cause than tenyears offighting. Selective kindness should also bepart ofyourarsenal ofdeception.For yearstheancient Romans hadbesiegedthecityoftheFaliscans, alwaysun~ successfully.One day, however, when theRoman generalCamillus was encampedoutside thecity,hesuddenlysaw aman leadingsome children toward him. The man was aFaliscan teacher, and thechildren, itturned out, were the sons anddaughtersofthenoblest and wealthiest citizens of thetown. Onthepretense oftakingthese children outfor awalk, hehad ledthem straight totheRomans, offering them ashostagesinhopes ofin- gratiatinghimself with Camillus, thecity’s enemy. Camillus did not take thechildren hostage.Hestrippedtheteadier, tied hishands behind hisback, gaveeach child arod, and letthem whip him allthewayback tothecity.The gesturehad animmediate effect on theFaliscans. Had Camillus used thechildren ashostages,some inthecity would have voted tosurrender. And even ifthe Faliscans hadgoneon fighting,their resistance would have been halfhearted. Camillus’s refusal to takeadvantage ofthesituation broke down theFaliscans’ resistance, and theysurrendered. Thegeneralhad calculated correctly. And inanycase he had hadnothing tolose: Heknew that thehostage ploywould not have ended thewar, atleast notright away. Byturningthesituation around, he earned hisenemy’strust andrespecg disarmingthem. Selective kindness will often break down even the most stubborn foe:Aiming right forthe heart, itcorrodes thewill tofight back. Remember: Byplayingonpeople’s emotions, calculated acts ofkind- ness can turn aCaponeinto agulliblechild. Aswithanyemotionalap- proach,thetactic must bepracticed with caution: Ifpeopleseethrough it, their disappointed feelingsofgratitudeand warmth will become the most violent hatred and distrust Unlessyoucan make thegestureseem sincere andheartfelt, donotplay with fire.Image:The Trojan Horse.

Count Lustig, pullingthebiggestcan ofhiscareer, was about tosell theEiffel Tower toanunsuspectingindusixialist who believed thegovern- ment wasauctioning itoffforscrapmetal. The industrialist wasprepared tohand over ahugesum ofmoneytoLustig,who hadsuccessfully imper- sonated agovernment official. Atthelastminute, however, themark was suspicious. Something about Lustigbothered him. Atthemeetinginwhich hewas tohand over themoney, Lustig sensed hissudden distrust. Leaningover totheindustrialist, Lustig explained,inalowwhisper, how low hissalary was, how difficult hisfinances were, onand on.After a few minutes ofthis, theindustlialist realized thatLustigwasasking for a bribe. For thefirst time herelaxed. Now heknew hecould trust Lustig: Since allgovernment officials were dishonest, Lustig had tobereal. The man forked over themoney.
