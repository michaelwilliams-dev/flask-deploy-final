life of the unjust man is stronger42 than that of the just man. Which do you choose, Glaucon," I said, "and which speech is truer in your opinion?" "I for my part choose the life of the just man as more profitable." "Did you hear," I said, "how n1any good things Thrasymachus listed a moment ago as belonging to the life f the unjust man?" 34Ei "I heard," he said, "but rm not persuaded." "Then do you want us to persuade him, if we're able to find a way, that what he says isn't true?" "How could I not want it?" he said. "Now," I said, "if we should speak at length against him, setting speech against speech, telling how many good, things belong to being just, and then he should speak in return, and we again, there'll be need 345. b of counting the good things and measuring how many each of us has in each speech, and then we'll be in need of some sort of judges43 who will decide.

"The latter," he said. "Come now, Thrasymachus," I said, "answer us from the begin? ning. Do you assert that perfect injustice is more profitable than justice when it is perfect?"

"The opposite," he said. "Is justice then vice?" "No, but very high-minded innocence." d. "Do you call injustice corruption?"44 "No, rather good counsel." "Are the unjust in your opinion good as well as prudent, Thra? symachus?" "Yes, those who can do injustice perfectly," he said, "and are able to subjugate cities and tribes of men to themselves. You, perhaps, sup? pose I am speaking of cutpurses. Now, such things, too, are profitable," he said, "when one gets away with them; but they aren't worth men? tioning compared to those I was just talking about." d. "As to that," I said, 'Tm not unaware of what you want to say. But I wondered about what went before, that you put injustice in the camp of virtue and wisdom, and justice among their opposites?" "But I do indeed set them down as such." "That's already something more solid, my comrade," I said, "and it's no longer easy to know what one should say. For if you had set in? justice --down as profitable but had nevertheless agreed that it is viciousness or shameful, as do some others, we would have something to say, speaking according to
