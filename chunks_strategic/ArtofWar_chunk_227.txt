the power of the people, no one can rival you in achievement. If you can accurately discern these bases of action, and add dignity and faith to them, you can take on the most formidable opponent and prevail over the most valiant adversary. Victory and Defeat When the wise and talented are in the higher positions and undesirables are in low positions, the armed forces are happy. When the soldiers are scared, if they talk to each other of valiant combat, look to each other for martial dignity, and urge each other on by rewards and penalties, these are signs of certain victory. When the armies have been shaken up several times, if the soldiers become lazy, insubordinate, untrustworthy, and unruly, if they scare each other with talk about the enemy, if they talk to each other about booty, make hints to each other of disaster and fortune, or confuse each other with weird talk, these are signs of certain defeat. Using Authority People�s lives depend on generals, as do success and failure, calamity and fortune; so if the rulership does not give them the power to reward and punish, this is like tying up a monkey and trying to make it cavort around, or like gluing someone�s eyes shut and asking him to distinguish colors. If rewards are up to powerful civilians and punishments do not come from the generals, people will seek personal profit�then who will have any interest in fighting? Even with superlative strategy and performance, self-defense would be impossible under these circumstances. Therefore Sun Tzu the Martialist said, �When a general is in the field, there are some orders he doesn�t accept from the civilian ruler.� It is also said, �In the army, you hear the orders of the generals, you don�t hear about commands from the emperor.� Grieving for the Dead Good generals of ancient times took care of their people as one might take care of a beloved child. When there was difficulty they would face it first themselves, and when something was achieved they would defer to others. They would tearfully console the wounded and sorrowfully mourn the dead. They would sacrifice themselves to feed the hungry and remove their own garments to clothe the cold. They honored the wise and provided for their living; they rewarded and encouraged the brave. If generals can be like this, they can take over anywhere they go. Allies To operate, the armed forces need allies as consultants and assistants to the leadership. Everyone looks up to those who are thoughtful and have unusual strategies beyond the ordinary ken, who are widely learned and have broad vision, and who have many skills and great talents. Such people can be made top allies. Those who are fierce, swift, firm, and sharp are heroes of an age. Such people can be made second-ranked allies. Those who talk a lot but not always to the point, who are slight in ability, with little that is extraordinary, are people with ordinary
