Glaucon askswhether justice isgoodbynature oronlybylawor convention, and isthusthe firstparticipant inthedialogue whoturns to nature ashisstandard. He isadaring manwhose desire nottobehood- winked bycommon opinions about thegood giveshim acertain in- tellectual force lacked byThrasymachus. The latter isperhaps toocon- cerned with,anddependent on,whatmen usually hold tobegood to look forastandard independent ofcivil society which might divorce himfrom it.Andhealso issoconvinced ofthepower ofart,andofhis artinparticular, toaccomplish whatever onewants thathedoes not feelcompelled tolook forthepermanent limits andendswhich cannot bealtered byart.Atallevents, itisGlaucon whogoes totherootsby elaborating— though inthename ofothers— ateaching about nature which denies thatman's nature isessentially political. Bound byits ancestral lawsandmyths, thecity, likeThrasymachus, doesnotraise thequestion ofnature; infact ithinders thequestion from arising. It wishes togivetheaccidents ofthistimeandplace thesame status as theunchanging principles ofallthings. Itpresents acertain combina- tionofnature andconvention asthehorizon within w^hich itscitizens must liveand act.Thecosmic phenomena areinterpreted bythecityas expressions ofthesame divine willwhich supports itslaws; theways of theheavens andthose ofcityareinitsview thesame.The first effort of philosophy orscience wastosortoutthevarious elements inourex- perience, todiscover thetruecause oflightning, eclipses, etc.,by means ofinvestigation unhampered byauthority. Ithadtoliberate it- selffrom theweight ofrespectable opinion andtobecome aware ofthe existence ofrationally comprehensible principles ofthephenomena seen intheheavens; inother words, nature hadtobediscovered against thewillofthecity.Theconsequence ofthisinvestigation wastodeny thenaturalness ofthecity, todeny thatthelightning which strikes the manhasanyrelation tojustice, todeny thateclipses aresigns from the gods. Inthisperspective, justice ismerely human and isonlypunished ifseenbyhuman beings. Glaucon, who assumes thisphilosophic background in-hisspeech, draws theconclusion that ifamancould be invisible tohuman beings, therewould benoreason forhimtobejust inhispursuit ofthegood. Recalling toourminds Thrasymachus' shepherd, hetellsthestory ofGyges, theshepherd, who, with hisring thatmade him invisible, deposed hismaster andexploited hismaster's [340 ] Interpretive Essay flocks, animal andhuman. And,bymeans ofThrasymachus' rhetoric, mencanmake their actschange appearance, which istantamount to making them invisible. Oneshould beindifferent tothecityoruse it forone'sownpurposes, butoneneed never take itseriously foritself. Glaucon challenges Socrates with theproblem atitsmost extreme. He honestly wishes tobeconvinced thatjustice isbest,buthedoes not ji want tobeduped. Hemustknow; forabove allheseekswhat isgood ^forhimself anddoes notcare tobetaken inbyedifying preaching which willcausehim tomisstheenjoyment oftheobjects ofhisdesires. Glaucon presents the political supplement topre-Socratic natural philosophy: thecity limitsmen inthepursuit ofthegood things, but itsonly justification fordoing soistheneed topreserve itself. According toGlaucon, thecharacter ofjustice canbediscovered in itsorigin; thenature ofathing, inhisview, istobeunderstood bythat fromwhich itcomes, byitsbeginning andnot itsend.Nature dictates thepursuit ofone'sowngood, butbecause ofthescarcity ofgood things, thispursuit mustbecarried onattheexpense ofothers. Itis good totakefrom others what belongs tothem, and itisbadtohave things taken which belong tooneself; butthebadness ofthelatter ex- ceeds thegoodness oftheformer. Forthosewhocannot succeed attak- ingwithout alsobeing taken from, itisbetter tocompromise, giving up theoneandgaining immunity from theother. Such acompromise, however, constitutes nomore than ahuman construction, acontract. It does notovercome nature, which stillimpels aman togetwhat he wants without considering thecontract; itissimply arecognition ofthe imprudence ofdoing so.Since the city's justice does notmakemen good orhappy, ablemenwhohave theartsofferee anddeception can, and inallreason should, continue tofollow thedictates ofnature. In other words, superior men arenotbound bythecontract fortheydo notreceive anyadvantage from it.Inthisperspective, justice isthe simple, unadorned will,following thecontract, toavoid injuring other men, whether thismeans obeying thelaws setdown tothisendor equitably correcting thelawsoastofulfill itsintention. There is,then, noparticular knowledge orability implied inbeing just; itismerely the performance ofadifficult task thatgoes against thegrain ofone's desires. Thrasymachus hadsaid thatthelawsweremade forthead- vantage ofthestronger, meaning by"thestronger" whatever party hap- pens toholdpower. Glaucon implicitly accuses himofholding acon- ventional view ofthestronger. There
