used up, the army is worn out, and the populace is exhausted. When levies are oppressive and the people are impoverished, the country is drained. Master Sun Therefore a wise general strives to feed off the enemy. Each pound of food taken from the enemy is equivalent to twenty pounds you provide by yourself. CAO CAO Transportation of provisions itself consumes twenty times the amount transported. ZHANG YU It takes twenty pounds of provisions to deliver one pound of provisions to a distant army. If the terrain is rugged, it takes even more than that. That is why an able general will always feed off the enemy. Master Sun So what kills the enemy is anger, what gets the enemy�s goods is reward. ZHANG YU If you stir up your officers and troops so that they are all enraged, then they will kill the enemy. If you reward your men with spoils, that will make them fight on their own initiative, so the enemy�s goods can be taken. That is why it is said that where there are big rewards there are valiant men. DU YOU If people know they will be richly rewarded if they overcome the opponent, then they will gladly go into battle. WANG XI This just means establishing rich rewards�if you let the troops plunder at will, they may get out of hand. Master Sun Therefore, in a chariot battle, reward the first to capture at least ten chariots. MEI YAOCHEN If you reward everyone, there will not be enough to go around, so you offer a reward to one in order to encourage everyone. Master Sun Change their colors, use them mixed in with your own. Treat the soldiers well, take care of them. CAO CAO You change their colors to make them the same as your own, you use them mixed in with your own so as not to leave them to their own devices. JIA LIN You change their colors so that they won�t be recognizable to the enemy. ZHANG YU Captured soldiers should be well treated, to get them to work for you. Master Sun This is called overcoming the opponent and increasing your strength to boot. DU MU By capturing the opponent�s soldiers and using the enemy�s supplies, you increase your own strength. MEI YAOCHEN When you capture soldiers, give them responsibilities according to their strengths, take care of them kindly, and they will work for you. HO YANXI If you use the enemy to defeat the enemy, you will be strong wherever you go. Master Sun So the important thing in a military operation is victory, not persistence. CAO CAO Persistence is not profitable. An army is like fire�if you don�t put it out, it will burn itself out. MENG SHI What is best is a quick victory and a speedy return. MEI YAOCHEN In all of the above-mentioned, it is important to be quick. If you are quick, then you can economize on expenditures and allow the people rest.
