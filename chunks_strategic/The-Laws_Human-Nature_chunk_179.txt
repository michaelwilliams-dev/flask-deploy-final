the idealized image of your self-opinion. Like everyone else, you can be quite self-absorbed and obsessed with your own agenda. With this awareness, you will not feel the need to be validated by others. Instead you will work at making yourself truly independent and concerned with the welfare of others, as opposed to staying attached to the illusion of your self-opinion. There was something terribly enthralling in the exercise of influence. No other activity was like it. To project one�s soul into some gracious form, and let it tarry there for a moment; to hear one�s own intellectual views echoed back to one with all the added music of passion and youth; to convey one�s temperament into another as though it were a subtle fluid or a strange perfume: there was a real joy in that�perhaps the most satisfying joy left to us in an age so limited and vulgar as our own, an age grossly carnal in its pleasures, and grossly common in its aims. �Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray 8 Change Your Circumstances by Changing Your Attitude The Law of Self-sabotage E ach of us has a particular way of looking at the world, of interpreting events and the actions of people around us.

What made it doubly confusing was that his father did not beat him out of any apparent malice or anger. He told Anton he was doing it out of love. It was God�s will that children be beaten, to instill humility. That was how he had been raised, and look at what a fine man he had turned into. At the end of the beating, young Anton had to kiss his father�s hand and ask to be forgiven. At least he was not alone in this ordeal�his four brothers and one sister all received the same treatment. The beating was not the
