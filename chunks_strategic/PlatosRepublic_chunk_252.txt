ac- � cept the fall of the dice and settle one's affairs accordingly-in whatever way argument declares would be best. One must not behave like children who have stumbled and who hold on to the hurt place and spend their time in crying out; rather one must always habituate the soul to tum as quickly as possible to curing and setting aright what has fallen and is sick, doing away with lament by medicine." "That," he said, "at all events, would be the most correct way for a m_an to face what chance brings." "And, we say, the best part is willing to follow this calculation-" "Plainly." "-whereas the part that leads to reminiscences of the suffering and to complaints and can't get enough of them, won't we say that it is irrational, idle, and a friend of cowardice?" "Certainly we'll say that." "Now then, the irritable disposition affords much and varied imitation, while the prudent and quiet character, which is always nearly equal to itself, is neither easily imitated nor, when imitated, easily understood, especially by a festive assembly where all sorts of human beings are gathered in a theater. For the imitation is of a condi? tion that is surely alien to them." "That's entirely certain." "Then plainly the imitative poet isn't naturally directed toward any such part of the soul, and his wisdom isn't framed for satisfying it-if he's going to get a good reputation among the many-but rather toward the irritable and various disposition, because it is easily imitated." "Plainly." "Therefore it would at last be just for us to seize him and set him beside the painter as his antistrophe. For he is like the painter in mak? ing things that are ordinary by the standard of truth; and he is also similar in keeping company with a part of the soul that is on the same r fBook X I 604b-606b ,f.". r� SOCRATES/GI.A UCON bevel and not with the best part.

Simil rly, we shall say the imitative poet pro? iduces a bad regime in the soul of each private man by making phan? !toms that are very far removed from the truth and by gratifying the ':sours foolish part, which doesn't distinguish big from little, but ;believes the same things are at one time big and at another little." "Most certainly." "However, we haven't yet made the greatest accusation against� imitation. For the fact that it succeeds in maiming even the decent men, except for a certain rare few, is surely quite terrible." "Certainly, if it does indeed do that." "Listen and consider. When
