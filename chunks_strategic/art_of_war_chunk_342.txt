are not defending, pressure those who have slacked off, and attack those who are uncertain or confused. One reason for the use of surprise tactics is that they are ordinarily more economical than conventional tactics, insofar as they are designed to strike at points of least resistance. To obtain the greatest advantage with the least embroilment is one of the key arts of war. Defensive maneuvering is thus more than defensive. Not only is it a means of storing energy, it is a way to spy out the intentions and abilities of opponents. Sun Wu advises, �Even when you are solid, still be on the defensive; even when you are strong, be evasive.� Following up on this idea, Sun Bin adds: �Do not pursue opponents in flight,� for that would expend precious energy and also expose one�s own position and capacity. These conservative and even defensive maneuvers are bases for attack, which like defense begins with the mental aspect of warfare. Sun Wu proposes tactics that radically minimize one�s own expenditures while putting the opponent at maximum disadvantage: �Use anger to make them upset, use humility to make them arrogant.� Following up on this, Sun Bin gives some further advice on a convenient way to achieve the latter effect: �Disarray troops in confused ranks, so as to make the other side complacent.� The underlying idea is to put off on the enemy as much of the burden of warfare as possible, while reserving oneself intact. This is why the moral philosophy of warfare from which these texts arise is fundamentally nonaggressive and is ethically based on response rather than initiative. From moral philosophy, this is translated directly into practical strategy, as illustrated by Sun Wu in his tactical dictum, �Tire them while taking it easy, cause division among them while acting friendly,� and echoed by Sun Bin�s advice: �You eat to your fill and wait for the enemy to starve; you stay put comfortably and wait for the enemy to tire; you keep perfectly still and wait for the enemy to stir.� The power accumulated by the practice of maximum economy achieved by secrecy and reserve is enhanced by the ability to compromise the power of opponents. Since a direct approach to diminishing the enemy�s force would be most costly, again the scientific approach is preferred, as Sun Bin illustrates in his pivotal dicta: �Confuse them and split them up,� and �Those skilled at warfare are skilled at trimming enemies down and cutting their forces apart.� Strategic preference for this approach is also evident in the advice of Sun Wu, when he says, �A superior military operation attacks planning, the next best attacks alliances.� These are primary ways of splitting up opponents� forces. Sun Bin adds, �Attack them as they set up a front, split them up as they organize,� explaining the logic of such maneuvers in these terms: Those who are able to split up others� armies and control others� forces are adequate even with the smallest quantity; those
