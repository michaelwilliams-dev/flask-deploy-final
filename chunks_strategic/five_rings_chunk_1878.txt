illiberality and wrongdoing aswell asinnovation." "Most certainly," hesaid."However, Socrates, consider this:how- willourcitybeable tomake warwhen itpossesses nomoney, espe- cially ifit'scompelled tomakewaragainst awealthy one?" "It's plain," Isaid, "that against one itwould beharder, but against twoofthat sort itwould beeasier." b "How doyoumean?" hesaid. "Well," Isaid, "inthe firstplace, iftheguardians should have to fight, won't itbeaschampions inwarfighting with richmen?" "Yes," hesaid, "that's so." "Now, then, Adeimantus," Isaid, inyour opinion, wouldn't one boxer with thefinest possible training inthearteasily fightwithtwo rich, fatnonboxers?" "Perhaps notatthesame time," hesaid. [99 ] socrates/adeimantus theREPUBLIp 422h "Not even ifitwere possible forhim towithdraw abit," Isaid c "and turning onwhichever onecameupfirst, tostrike him,and ifhe didthisrepeatedly insunandstifling heat? Couldn't such amanhandle evenmore ofthat sort?" "Undoubtedly," hesaid, "that wouldn't beatallsurprising." "But don't yousuppose therichhavemore knowledge and ex- perience ofboxing than oftheartofwar?" "Ido,"hesaid. "Then inalllikelihood ourchampions willeasily fightwithtwoor three times theirnumber." "I'llgrant you that," hesaid, "forwhat yousay isright inmy opinion." d "What ifthey sentanembassy totheother cityandtoldthetruth? 'Wemake useofneither goldnorsilver, nor isitlawful forus,while it isforyou.Sojoinusinmaking warandkeep theothers' property.' Do yousuppose anywhohear that willchoose tomake waragainst solid, leandogs^ rather thanwith thedogs against fatandtender sheep?" "Not inmyopinion," hesaid. "But ifthemoney oftheothers is e gathered intoone city,lookoutthat itdoesn't endanger thecity that isn't rich." "You areahappy one," Isaid, "ifyousuppose itisfittocall 'city' another thansuch aswehavebeen equipping." "What elsethen?" hesaid. "The others ought togetbigger names," Isaid."Foreachofthem isverymany cities butnotacity, asthosewhoplay say.^There are 423a two, inanycase,warring witheach other, oneofthepoor, theother of therich.And within each ofthese there areverymany. Ifyou ap- proach them asthough theywere one, you'll beacomplete failure; but ifyouapproach them asthough theyweremany, offering totheones themoney andthepowers ortheverypersons oftheothers, you'll al- wayshave theuseofmany alliesandfewenemies. And aslong asyour city ismoderately governed intheway itwasjustarranged, itwillbe biggest; Idonotmean inthesense ofgood reputation buttruly biggest, even ifitshould bemadeupofonlyonethousand defenders. You'll not easily findonecitysobigasthis, either among theGreeks orthebar- h barians, although many seem tobemany times itssize.Ordoyousup- pose otherwise?" "No,byZeus," hesaid. "Therefore," Isaid, "thiswould alsobethefairest boundary for ourrulers; sobigmust theymake thecity,and,bounding offenough land sothat itwillbeofthat size,theymust lettherestgo." "What boundary?" hesaid. [loo] pookIV/422b-424b socrates/adeimantus "Isuppose thisone," Isaid,"up tothatpoint initsgrowth at 423b which it'swilHng tobeone, letitgrow, andnotbeyond." "That's fine," hesaid.c "Therefore, well also setthisfurther command ontheguardians, toguard ineverywayagainst thecity's being little orseemingly big; rather itshould besufficient andone." "This is,"hesaid,"perhaps aslight taskwewillimpose onthem." "And still slighter than that," Isaid, "iswhatwementioned earlier whenwesaid that ifachild ofslight ability werebom ofthe guardians, hewould have tobesent offtotheothers, and ifaserious onewerebom oftheothers, hewould have tobesent offtothe d guardians. Thiswasintended tomake plain thateach oftheother citizens toomust bebrought tothatwhich naturally suitshim—one man, onejob—sothateachman, practicing hisown,which isone, willnotbecome many butone;and thus, you see,thewhole city willnaturally grow tobeoneandnotmany." "This isindeed," hesaid, "alesser taskthan theother." "Yet,mygood Adeimantus," Isaid, "these arenot, asonemight think,many greatcommands weareimposing onthem, buttheyareall slight if,asthesaying goes, theyguard theonegreat—or,rather than e great, sufficient— thing." "What's that?" hesaid. "Their education andrearing," Isaid. "Ifbybeing welleducated theybecome sensible men, they'll easily seetoallthisandeverything elsewearenowleaving out—thatthepossession ofwomen, marriage, andprocreation ofchildren must asfaraspossible bearranged ac- cording totheproverb thatfriends have allthings incommon." 424a "Yes," hesaid, "thatwould bethemost correct way." "And hence," Isaid, "theregime, once well started, will rollon likeacircle initsgrowth. Forsound rearing andeducation, when they arepreserved, produce good natures; andsound natures,
