fearful, from the Church to the Ve. to netians, who needed stick by him. With their help he could have easily warded off others remained powerful. But no who sooner was he in Milan than he gave aid to Pope Alexander, help.ing him to occupy Romagna. Nor was he aware how this weak.ened him, alienating friends and allies, and giving the Church, in addition to the spiritual authority which gives it sway, so much political power. Having made one error, had commit an- he to to other. Namely, hold back Alexander's ambition and prevent him from becoming Lord of Tuscany, Louis had to enter Italy. It to wasn't enough aggrandize the Church and offend his friends, but, out of his ambitions for the Kingdom of Naples, he divided it with the King of Spain. Instead of remaining arbiter of Italy, he put in a partner to whom the ambitious and discontent ones of that province could turn. When he could have appointed a de.pendent of his own there, he removed one and put in someone who could turn against him. It is quite natural and ordinary for a Prince to want to expand his rule, and when they do, if they can, they are praised and not blamed. But when they are unsuccessful, but still want to do it, here lies the error and the fault. If France had the power take Naples, fine; if not, shouldn't have di to it 38� Niccol� Machiavelli vided it. Dividing Lombardy with the Venetians merits excuses because it gained France a foothold Italy; but the agenda in in Naples merits blame because it did not have this excuse. Louis therefore made these five mistakes: he lost support among the minor lords; he gave more power to an already powerful ruler; he put a powerful foreign potentate in; he didn't come to live there; and he didn't plant colonies. He could have escaped the consequences of these errors if he had not made a sixth error by seeking to strip Venice of its ac.quired possessions. He could have brought the Venetians down if he had not aggrandized the Church nor put in the King of Spain. But having done this he should never have humiliated the Vene.tians, because they were powerful enough to keep others out of Lombardy. The Venetians would never have let someone else into Lombardy unless they themselves took it over, and the others would never have given it to Venice after taking it from France, and going at it alone against them would not have made sense. If someone said that Louis would have ceded Romagna to Alexan.to to one der and Italy Spain avoid war, I would respond that should never get into an imbroglio to avoid a war because it does.n't save you. It just makes you vulnerable. If someone else cites the loyalty that the King owed to the Pope, to undertake all this to resolve his marriage and the promises made over the Archbishop.ric of Rouen,
