like the King of Epirus had such difficulty conserving his conquest in South Italy, and others the same . Their cases are not determined by the presence or lack of virtue, but by the disorder of the sub.ject land. HOWTO GOVERN CITIES OR PRINCIPALITIES WHICH, BEFORE OCCUPATION, LIVED ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN LAWS In the case of occupied states that have been used to living with their own laws in liberty, there are three modes of hold-I ing them: first, to ruin them; second , go live personally in them; third, let them live according to their laws while extracting tribute and creating a faithful oligarchy that will keep the state friendly. Such an oligarchy knows that the Prince created the state and they know they are dependent on his friendship and power and do everything they can to maintain it . It is easier to preserve a city by allowing it to live in liberty according to the customs of its citizens than by any other method. But both the Spartans and Romans are examples . The Spartans held both Athens and Thebes , creating an oligarchy, al.though they relost both cities . The Romans , to hold Capua, Car.thage , and Numanzia , took them apart, and didn't lose them. They wanted to hold Greece like the Spartans , leaving it free and with its own laws , but it didn't work. They were forced to disband many cities in it to hold Greece . This is because there is no sure method of pressing cities ex.cept by ruining them. Whoever takes a city used to living in lib. erty according to its own customs and does not ruin it risks being ruined by it . This is because the city can always rebel in the name of liberty and its ancient customs , none of which are ever forgot.ten with time no matter how much largesse . No matter what one does , if you don't disband the citizenry and immediately eradicate THE PRINCE �-45 the customs and traditions , they come back to haunt you � as in Pisa when the city rebelled against the Florentines after a hundred years of servitude . When the city is used to living under a Prince but the line is extinguished they are used to obeying on the one hand , and on the other hand, their old Prince is gone . They can neither agree among themselves nor can they live in freedom. This makes them likely to take arms ; a new Prince can more easily take over and secure his reign. In Republics , there is more life, more hate , more desire for revenge . You can't leave them alone and you can't al.low the memory of the old liberty. The safest way to deal with them is ruin them and then live there .
