In4-31 B.C., the war that had been brewing between Athens andSparta for solong finally erupted.Itlastedtwenty—seven years, but aftermany twists offortune, theSpartanwar machine finally emergedvictorious. The Spartansnow commanded anempire.and this time theycould notstayin their shell. Ifthey gave upwhat theyhadgained,thebeaten Athenians would regroupand riseagainst them, and the longwar would have been fought fornaught. After thewar, Athenian money pouredintoSparta.TheSpartanshad been trained inwarfare, notpoliticsoreconomics; because theywere so unaccustomed toit,wealth and itsaccompanying ways oflifeseduced and overwhelmed them. Spartan governorswere sent torule what had been Athenian lands; farfrom home, theysuccumbed totheworst forms ofcor- ruption. Spartahad defeated Athens, butthefluid Athenianwayoflife was slowly breaking down itsdisciplineandlooseningitsrigidorder. And Athens, meanwhile, wasadaptingtolosingitsempire, managingtothrive asacultural and economic center. Confused byachangeinitsstatusquo, Sparta grewweaker and weaker.

Theyhad noculture beyond warfare, noarts torelieve thetension, acon stant anxiety about the statusquo. While their neighborstook tothe sea, learningtoadapttoaworld ofconstant motion, theSpartansentombed themselves intheir own system.
