"Therefore we'll believe Homer inthis atleast," Isaid."And at sacrifices and allsuch occasions we'llhonor thegood, insofar asthey haveshown themselves tobegood, withhymns andthethingswewere mentioning justnowand,besides that,with 'seats andmeats and full e cups,'29 sothat we'll give thegoodmenandwomen what iscon- ducive totheir training atthesame time ashonoring them." "What yousay,"hesaid, "isquite fine." "All right.Asforthosewho dieonacampaign, won'twefirstsay thatthemanwhodied inearning agood reputation isamember ofthe golden class?"3<* "Most ofall." "Won't webelieve Hesiod thatwhen anyofthat class die.

"We'll inquire, therefore, ofthegod hovi?thedemonic anddivine beings should beburied andwithwhat distinction, andwe'llburythem asheindicates." "Ofcourseweshall." "And fortherestoftimewell care fortheirtombs andworship at them asatthose ofdemons. And we'llmake thesame conventions for anyoneofthosewhohavebeenjudged exceptionally good inlifewhen dying ofoldageorinsome other way." "That isonly just," hesaid. "Andwhat about this?How willoursoldiers dealwithenemies?" "Inwhat respect?" "First, astoenslavement: which seems just, thatGreek cities enslave Greeks; orthatthey, insofar aspossible, notevenallow another citytodoitbutmake itahabit tospare theGreek stock, wellaware of thedanger ofenslavement atthehands ofthebarbarians?" "Sparing them," hesaid, "iswholly andentirely superior." "And, therefore, thatthey notthemselves possess aGreek as slave, andgivethesame advice totheother Greeks?" "Most certainly," hesaid."Atanyrate inthatwaytheywould be more inclined toturn tothebarbarians andkeep offoneanother." "What about this?" Isaid."When theywin, isitafinepractice to stripthedead ofanything more than theirarms?Ordoesn't itprovide a pretext forcowards nottoattack themanwho's stillfighting, asthough theyweredoing something necessary inpoking around thedead, while many anarmy beforenowhasbeen lostasaconsequence ofthisplun- dering?" "Quite so." "Doesn't itseem illiberal andgreedy toplunder acorpse, andthe mark ofasmall, womanish mind tohold theenemy tobethebody of thedeadenemy who's flown awayand leftbehind thatwithwhich he fought?

"They must, therefore, leave offstripping corpses andprevent- ing their recovery?" "Yes indeed," hesaid, "they must,byZeus." "And, further, wesurely won't bring thearms tothetemples as [149 ] XaÂ«ATEs/GLAUCON THEREPUBLlf) 69e votive offerings, especially those oftheGreeks, ifwecare atallabout 70a thegood v\rilloftheother Greeks. Rather wellbeafraid itwould bea defilement tobring such things from ourkintoatemple, unless,of course, thegodshould sayotherwise." "Quite right," hesaid. "And what about ravaging theGreek countryside andburning houses? What sortofthing willyour soldiers dototheenemies?" "Iwould beglad," hesaid, "tohearyoupresent your opinion." "Well, inmyopinion," Isaid, "they'll doneither ofthese things, h butthey'll takeaway theyear's harvest; anddoyouwantmetotellyou why?" "Certainly." "Itappears tomethatjust astwo different names areused,war andfaction, sotwothings also existandthenames apply todifferences inthese two.Thetwothings Imean are,ontheonehand, what isone's ownandakin,andwhat isalien, andforeign, ontheother.Now the name faction isapplied tothehatred ofone'sown,wartothehatred of thealien." "What you're saying," hesaid, "iscertainly notoffthepoint." c "Now seewhether what Isaynext isalsotothepoint. Iassert that theGreek stock iswith respect toitself itsownandakin,with respect tothebarbaric, foreign and alien." "Yes," hesaid, "that isfine." "Then when Greeks fight with barbarians andbarbarians with Greeks, well assert they are atwarand areenemies^^ bynature, and thishatred mustbecalled war;whilewhen Greeks doanysuch thing toGreeks, we'll saythatthey arebynature friends, butinthis caseGreece issickandfactious, andthiskindofhatred mustbecalled d faction." "I,forone,"hesaid,"agree toconsider itinthatway." "Now observe," Isaid, "inwhat isnowadays understood tobe faction, thatwherever such athing occurs andacity issplit, ifeach sidewastes thefields andburns thehouses oftheothers, it.seems that thefaction isawicked thingandthatthemembers ofneither sideare lovers oftheir city.
