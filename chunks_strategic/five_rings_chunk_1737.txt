TRANSGRESSION OFTHE LAW Sometime intheearly 1520s, King HenryVIII ofEngland decided todi- vorce hiswife, Catherine ofAragon, because shehad failed tobeat him a son, and because hehad fallen inlove with theyoungandcomely Anne Boleyn. The pope, Clement VII, opposedthedivorce, and threatened the kingwith excommunication. Theking’smost powerful minister, Cardinal Wolsey,also saw noneed fordivorce—-—-and hishalfhearted supportofthe kingcost him hispositionand soon hislife. One man inHem-y’s cabinet, Thomas Cromwell, notonly supported him inhisdesire for adivorce buthad anidea forrealizingit:acomplete break with thepast.Heconvinced thekingthatbyseveringtieswith Rome andmaking himself thehead ofanewly formed English church, hecould divorce Catherine andmarryAnne. ByI531Henrysawthis astheonlyso- lution. Toreward Cromwell forhissimplebutbrilliant idea, heelevated this sonofablacksmith tothepost ofroyal councillor. By1534 Cromwell had been named theking’s secretary, and asthe powerbehind thethrone hehad become themost powerfulman inEng- land. Butforhim thebreak with Rome wentbeyondthesatisfaction ofthe l<ing‘scarnal desires: Heenvisioned anew Protestant order inEngland, with thepoweroftheCatholic Church smashed and itsvast wea.lth inthe hands ofthekingand thegovernment. Inthat sameyear heinitiated a complete surveyofthechurches and monasteries ofEngland. And asit turned out, the treasures andmoneysthat thechurches had accumulated over the centuries were far more than hehadimagined;hisspiesand agentscame back with astonishing figures. Tojustifyhisschemes, Cromwell circulated stories about thecorrup- tion intheEnglish monasteries, their abuse ofpower,their exploitation of thepeople they supposedlyserved. Havingwon Parliamenfs support for breaking upthemonasteries, hebegantoseize their holdingsand toput them outofexistence onebyone. Atthe same time, hebegantoimpose Protestantism, introducingreforms inreligiousritual andpunishing those who stuck toCatholicism, and who now were called heretics. Virtually overnight, Englandwas converted toanew official religion. Aterror fell onthecountry. Some people had suffered under the Catholic Church, which before thereforms hadbeen immensely powerful, butmost Britons had strongties toCatholicism and toitscomforting ritu- als.Theywatched inhorror aschurches were demolished, imagesofthe Madonna and saints were broken inpieces, stainedglasswindows were smashed, and the churches’ treasures were confiscated. With monasteries that had succored thepoor suddenly gone,thepoornow flooded the streets. Thegrowing ranks ofthebeggarclass were further swelled byfor mermonks. Ontopofallthis, Cromwell levied hightaxes topayforhis ec« clesiastical reforms. In1535 powerful revolts intheNorth ofEnglandthreatened totopple Henryfrom histhrone.
