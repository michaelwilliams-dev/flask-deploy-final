and,worst ofall,shown to beaninferior rhetorician. Theapparently shameless Thrasymachus, willing tosayanything, isrevealed inallhisvanity, forheblushes. He hasnotruefreedom ofmind, because heisattached toprestige, tothe applause ofthemultitude andhence their thought. Hegives voice merely tocommon opinions which areusually kept quiet andtherefore appears wiser thanmostmen.Butheisreally conventional andpetty, a lover ofapplause more thanoftruth. Thenextargument advanced bySocrates infavor ofjustice isthat itisnecessary. Itbegins from amore conventional understanding of justice: obedience tocommon ruleswhich enable agroup toactincom- mon. Socrates proves thattheacquisition ofanyofthegoals previously praised byThrasymachus requires atleastsome justice. This isun- deniably true,but itdoesnotprove thatthose goals areunattractive; it onlyshows that justice maybeanunpleasant necessity ingaining them—arepulsive means toadesirable end.Inthissense, thejustice of acitywould benodifferent from thatofaband ofrobbers. Each is forced tomake some sacrifices ofimmediate individual advantage for thesakeoflong-range self-interest. There isnothing intrinsically more noble about thecity.Atthispoint itwould almost seem asthough Soc- rateswere accusing Thrasymachus ofbeing too"idealistic." The latter thinks thestrongmancansimply ignore justice, while Socrates teaches thatjustice mustbeamatter ofconcern tohimwhowants togetmore than others; itisanunfortunate factoflife. Thethirdargument istotheeffect thatjustice istobedesired be- cause itisthehealth andperfection ofthesoul.Inthecourse ofthe first [336 ] Interpretive Essay argument, Thrasymachus hadsomehow agreed with Socrates that justice isvirtue. Butwhat isvirtue, ifnotthatwhich allows athing to perform itswork well?Nobody would want tohave asickbody ora horse thatcould notpull itsload. Ittherefore follows that justice, asthe virtue ofthe soul, isdesirable initself. Inaddition toitsother weaknesses, thisargument ispurely formal andempty. Everyone wish- estohave ahealthy soul.Butwhat itconsists inisthequestion. Above all, itisnotclear thatthejustice spoken ofinthisthird argu- ment isidentical with thatspoken ofinthesecond one. Isthemanwho obeys thelawsofthecommunity forthesakeofultimate gainprecisely thesameman astheonewho isperfecting hissoul?Arethere nottwo definitions ofjustice implied here thathavenonecessary connection, so thatthemanwho fulfills thecommands, oftheone isnotnecessarily fulfilling thecommands oftheother andmayevenbecontradicting them? Thus ends theinconclusive argument withThrasymachus, andhe isshunted aside. Buttwoimportant objects havebeenaccomplished by theconfrontation. The traditional definitions ofjustice have been reduced toashambles, revealing theneed forafiesh start. Fur- theiinore, although, asSocrates disamningly admits, theyhave not defined justice buthavewandered, theirwandering hasnotbeen pur- poseless—they have notdefined justice, buttheyhave succeeded in defining theproblem ofjustice. Justice iseither whatmakes acity prosper oritisavirtue ofthesoulandhence necessaiy tothehappiness oftheindividual. Thequestion iswhether thetwo possibilities are identical, whether devotion tothecommon good leads tothehealth of the soul~~oj- whether themanwith ahealthy soul isdevoted tothecom- mongood. ItislefttoGlaucon andAdeimantus topose thisquestion which isthedistillation ofthearguments ofBook I. {357a-367e) With Glaucon andAdeimantus, Socrates becomes a teacher. Wewatch himeducating those Athenian youths hewas ac- cused ofcorrapting. Theaction oftheRepublic nowbecomes aformal response tothecharge made inAristophanes' Clouds which showed Soc- rates leaving thescene andpermitting theunjust speech toovercome thejustone.Herehebecomes thedefender ofjustice; indeed thewhole Republic represents thetriumph ofthejustspeech. Thetwoyouths, brothers ofPlato, introduce anewelement intothedialogue. (For another account ofSocrates' relationship toGlaucon, cf.Xenophon, Memorabilia, III, vi.)They arepot-^ntial Athenian statesmen, men whose goals transcend thehorizon ofsensuality andmoney which limited theinterlocutors ofthe firstbook.They arelovers ofhonor. [337 ] THEREPUBLIC which lends nobihty totheir souls, freesthemfrom thegoalswhich ren- dered Thrasymachus' notion ofadvantage sociude andnarrow, and gives them thespiritual substance required forthesublimating ex- perience ofSocratic education. Theyhave oftenheard thearguments ofrhetoricians andsophists, allofwhich, according toGlaucon, propound thethesis ofThrasyma- chus. Thisteaching istheapplication topolitics ofwhat hascome tobe known aspre-Socratic philosophy. The results ofthestudy ofnature ledtheearlier philosophers tobelieve thatthere isnocosmic support forjustice, thatthegods, ifthey exist atall,havenocare formen. Justice is,then,merely human convention andhence amatter ofindif- ference tothosewhowish toliveaccording tonature. Thisdoes
