The great Baroqueartist and architect Pietro Bemini was amaster at sniffing outyounger potential rivals andkeepingthem inhisshadow. One dayayoungstonemason named Francesco Boiromini showed Bernini his architectural sketches.Recognizinghis talent immediately,Bernini in- stantly hired Borromini ashisassistant, which delighted theyoungman but wasactually onlyatactic tokeephim close athand, sothat hecould play psychological gamesonhim and create inhim akind ofinferioritycom~ plex.And indeed, despiteBorromini’s brilliance, Bernini has thegreater fame.

Ites- tablished instead ademocracythat was tolast over acentury,adernoc» racythat became the source ofitspowerand itsproudestachievement. But asthedemocracy evolved, sodid aproblemtheAthenians had never faced: How todeal with those who did not concern themselves with the cohesion ofasmall city surrounded byenemies, who did notwork forits greater glory,butthought ofonly themselves andtheir own ambitions and petty intrigues?The Athenians understood that these people, ifleftalone, would sow dissension, divide thecityinto factions, and stirupanxieties, allofwhich could lead totheruin oftheir democracy. Violentpunishmentnolonger suited the new, civilized order that Athens had created. Instead thecitizens found another, more satisfying, and less brutalwaytodeal with thechronicallyselfish: Every year they would gatherinthemarketplaceand write on apiece ofearthenware, an astralcon, the name ofanindividual theywanted toseebanished from the cityfor tenyears.

He made such aShow ofhisrighteousness, andthis,they believed, disguised hisfeelings ofsuperiorityand scorn forthe common folk. Hisomnipres- ence inAthenian politicsbecame obnoxious; the citizens grew tired of hearing him called “The just.” Theyfeared that this wasjust thetypeof man——judgmental, haughty—whowould eventuallystirupfierce divi- sions among them, In482 B.C., despiteAristides’ invaluable expertisein ‘thecontinuingwar with thePersians, they collected the
