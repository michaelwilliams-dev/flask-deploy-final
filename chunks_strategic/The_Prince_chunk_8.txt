From that time onwards, throughout Machiavelli�s life, Italy was sel. or dom entirely free from the invasions of one foreign army an.other, and there followed a period of bewildering confusion dur.ing which the Emperor, the French, the Swiss, and the Spaniards, the Pope and the more powerful Italian states were all at war and all alternately enemies and allies of each other, while every part of Italy suffered in turn from the desolation of the country and the brutalities of the foreign soldiery.
