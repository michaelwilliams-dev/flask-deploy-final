This much has been agreed, Glaucon: for a city that is going to be governed on a high level, women must be in common, chil? dren and their entire education must be in common, and similarly the practices in war and peace must be in common, and their kings must be those among them who have proved best in philosophy and with respect to war." "Yes," he said, "it has been agreed." "Furthermore, we also accepted that when the rulers are one established, they must take the lead and settle the soldiers in houses-such as we spoke of before--that have nothing private for ï¿½ anyone but are common for all. And, in addition to such houses, as to possessions, if you remember, we presumably came to an agreement about what sort they are to have." "Yes, I do remember," he said, "that we supposed that no one must possess any of the things the others nowadays have; but that like champions of war and guardians, they will receive a wage annually from the others consisting of the bare subsistence required for their guarding, and for this wage they must take care of themselves and the rest of the city." "What you say is right," I said. "But come, since we have com? pleted this, let's recall where we took the detour that brought us here so that we can go back to the same way." 543 a b C 543C d 544 a b C d e "That's not hard," he said.

Concerning the remaining regimes, as I re? member, you asserted that there are four forms it is worthwhile to have an account of, and whose mistakes are worth seeing; and similarly with the men who are like these regimes; so that, when we have seen them all and agreed which man is best and which worst, we could consider whether the best man is happiest and the worst most wretched, or whether it is otherwise. -And just as I was asking which four regimes you meant, Polemarchus and Adeimantus interrupted. That's how you picked up the argument and got here." "What you remember," I said, "is quite correct." "Well, then, like a wrestler, give me the same hold again; and when I put the same question, try to tell what you were going to say then." "If I am able," I said. "And, in fact," he said, "I myself really desire to hear what four regimes you meant." "It won't be hard for you to hear
