IntheMiddle Ages andHigh Re naissance, itsvirtual monopolyontrade tothe east made itthewealthiest cityinEurope.Under abeneficent republican government, Venelians en- joyedliberties that few other Italians had ever known. Yetinthesixteenth centurytheir fortunes suddenly changed, Theopening oftheNew World transferred powertotheAtlantic side ofEuropewtotheSpanishand For- tuguese,and later theDutch andEnglish. Venice could notcompeteeco nomicallyand itsempire graduallydwindled.

Members ofVenice’s most importantnoble families accordinglywent togethertoBrescia, where Bragadino lived. Theytoured hispalaceand watched inawe ashedemonstrated hisgold-making abilities, takinga pinch ofseeminglyworthless minerals andtransformingitinto several ounces ofgold dust.
