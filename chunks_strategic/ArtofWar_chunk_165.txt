circle�who could exhaust them? MEI YAOCHEN The comprehensiveness of adaptive movement is limitless. WANG XI Opponents cannot exhaust you. Master Sun When the speed of rushing water reaches the point where it can move boulders, this is the force of momentum. When the speed of a hawk is such that it can strike and kill, this is precision. So it is with skillful warriors�their force is swift, their precision is close. Their force is like drawing a catapult, their precision is like releasing the trigger. DU MU Their force is swift in the sense that the force of the momentum of battle kills when it is released�that is why it is likened to a drawn catapult. Master Sun Disorder arises from order, cowardice arises from courage, weakness arises from strength. LI QUAN If you presume on the orderliness of government and fail to provide for the comfort of the governed, thus creating much resentment, disorder is certain to arise. JIA LIN If you presume an order, disorder will arise. If you presume on courage and strength, timidity and weakness will arise. DU MU What this means is that if you want to feign disorder so as to lead opponents on, first you must have complete order, for only then can you create artificial disorder.

WANG XI Order and disorder are changes in organization. Organization means methodical regulation. Courage and cowardice are changes in momentum or force. Strength and weakness are changes in formation. LI QUAN When an army has the force of momentum, even the timid become brave; when it loses the force of momentum, even the brave become timid. Nothing is fixed in the laws of warfare�they develop based on momenta. CHEN HAO The brave act quickly, while the timid drag their feet. When opponents see you are not moving ahead, they will assume you are timid, and will take you lightly. You then take advantage of their laxity to use the force of momentum to attack them. Master Sun Therefore those who skillfully move opponents make formations that opponents are sure to follow, give what opponents are sure to take. They move opponents with the prospect of gain, waiting for them in ambush. CAO CAO Formations that opponents are sure to follow are formations that give the impression of exhaustion. Opponents are moved by the prospect of an advantage. DU MU It does not only mean giving the impression of exhaustion and weakness. When you are stronger than your opponent, then you appear worn out to induce the opponent to come to
