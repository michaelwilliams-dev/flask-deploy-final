Musashi�s father was very likely Hirata Munisai. He was one of the principal vassals of a minor feudal lord of the mountainous region of Sakushu, west of Kyoto. He was a practitioner of the sword and the jitte, a small 1. metal weapon with six hooks on it with which it was possible to parry a sword and potentially immobilize it for a moment. 5. The province of Harima corresponds to a part of the present-day prefecture of Hyogo. 6. As far as Musashi�s year of birth is concerned, opinions are divided between 1582 and 1584. I have adopted the second date, which seems the more trustworthy. 7. The province of Tajima corresponds to the current prefecture of Hyogo. 8. Certain duels Musashi fought have remained famous. One of the best known is that in which, all alone, he opposed the adepts of the Yoshioka dojo, one of the most famous of the eight schools of Kyoto. After successively vanquishing the two principal masters of the school in individual combat, Musashi confronted the entire group of the school�s practitioners by himself. His victory over the Yoshioka dojo began to solidly establish Musashi�s reputation. This combat took place in 1604; Musashi was then twenty years old. At the age of twenty-one, one year after this combat, Musashi wrote �The Mirror of the Way of Strategy� (Hyodokyo), which is composed of twenty-eight instructions on strategy. This shows that from the time of his youth he was trying to arrive at a kind of written synthesis of his art. We find in that work a section whose title (�When One Is Fighting against Several Adversaries�) recalls this fight against the Yoshioka dojo. 9. Musashi recognized when he was about thirty that despite all the victories he had won up to that point, he had not attained the ultimate level of his art. These victories were only relative ones, since accidental elements�chance, the inadequacy of his opponents, and so forth�were factors in them. For twenty more years he sought after the immutable essence of his art, and it was not until he was around fifty that he believed he had reached a satisfactory state of insight. He expressed this in a poem, as follows: I penetrated so deeply into the mountains in my quest, Now here I am, come out the other side, so close to human beings. 10. Four-thirty in the morning. 11. �Warrior families,� buke: This word literally means �family� or �clan,� the 1. ke of a warrior, bu. Here the term is used to refer to the class of warriors in the context of the education that is appropriate for this social group. The term ke is also pronounced ie and means �house,� �family,� and also �clan.� Here, by an extension of the sense of �clan,� it designates the class of warriors. The terms bushi, �warriors� or �samurai,� and buke should be distinguished. 12. Suki mono or suki sha: from suki, �art of living that includes the art of tea,� and
