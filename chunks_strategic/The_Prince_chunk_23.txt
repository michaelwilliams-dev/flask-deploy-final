benefit are lukewarm supporters. This half-heartedness arises partly from fear of old adversaries, who have the old law on their side, and partly from the incredulity of men who never believe in the truth of new orders if not founded in firm experience. So whoever op.poses them easily finds partisans while the reformers act hesi.tantly so that the leader founders with them. One needs in order to examine this to see clearly whether the innovators stand alone or depend on others � whether, to gain their end, they have to beg or if they can force the issue. If they have to beg, it always turns out badly and leads to nothing. If they are strong themselves and force the issue then they rarely fail. Armed prophets win. The disarmed lose. Besides this, the nature of peoples vary � it is easy to persuade them but difficult to hold them to it. One needs to be prepared so that when the populace no longer cares you can force them to it. Moses, Cyrus, Theseus and Romulus would not have been THE PRINCE � 49 able to hold out long if they had not been armed � as happened in our time to Brother Savonarola who was ruined as soon as the populace began to disbelieve in him. He had no method to hold those who neither believed nor line up those who didn't believe. All those other personages faced grave difficulties but were forced to overcome them � but, once having overcome, they were venerated. Having gotten rid of those who were opposed, they survived powerful, secure, honored, and happy. To such high examples, I want to add a minor one, which puts perspective on them and will stand for all other examples: namely, Gerone II of Syracuse. This Lord became by himself Lord of Syracuse with no help from fortune except opportunity. The Syracusans were oppressed and elected him their Captain, from which position he gained the Principality. He showed such virtue that it was written, "Nothing prevented him from ruling ex.cept having a realm to rule." He terminated the old militia, cre.ated a new one, left off old friendships, and took on new ones. With friends and soldiers of his own, he had the foundation for building anew so that although he had a lot of trouble in winning, he had it easy to hold on afterwards. OF NEW PRINCIPALITIES WON WITH THE ARMS AND FORTUNES OF OTHERS T hose who become Princes on their own with small effort hav difficulty keeping their once they havethe do they experience no hardship, onlyPrincedom; on wonway, they run into trouble. Such are those who take a state by buying it or by special concession � as happened in Greece, in the Helle.spont and Ionia, where Darius made Princes and Satraps to main.tain his security and glory. This also happens where officers cor.rupt the soldiers with money and set up military rule. Such rulers depend on the will and fortune of
