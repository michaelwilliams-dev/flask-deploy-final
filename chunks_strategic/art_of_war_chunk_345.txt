is surprise.� For opponents of the expert, the question of whether one uses form or formlessness, convention or surprise, ultimately becomes a formless surprise in itself. For the tactician, it is simply a matter of what will work effectively; as Sun Wu says: �Do not mobilize when it is not advantageous, do not act when it is not productive, and do not fight when not imperiled.� After all factors have been considered, and the logic of the operation is clear, the decision to mobilize can be approached with intelligence. Then, if strategic necessity calls for it, subterfuge is the essence of the art of war. As Sun Wu says, in his colorful description of tactical surprise, �At first you are like a virgin girl, to whom the enemy opens his door. Then you are like a jackrabbit on the loose, which the enemy cannot keep out.� The prominence of subterfuge and deception in the techniques of classical strategists such as Sun Wu and Sun Bin often gives the impression of thoroughgoing ruthlessness. What must be remembered is that tactical action, as understood by these ancient thinkers, is not only considered from a material point of view, but also from psychological and philosophical points of view. Thus strategy is legitimately conceived in the aftermath, and in the reflection, of moral and ethical consideration. This critical factor is immediately evident in Sun Wu�s own introduction to the subject: �War is a national crisis; it is necessary to examine the grounds of death and life, and the ways to survival and extinction.� The premise that warfare is justified by its moral ground, not by its outcome, is often overlooked by those who focus only on strategy per se without keeping the ethical dimension of the context ever present in the background. This moral and ethical basis underlying the tradition of Sun Wu and Sun Bin can be found fully expressed in the classic Six Strategies, which is a basic source book for all the great works of this type. This classic is attributed to a sage of the twelfth century B.C.E., a teacher of kings from whose vast body of work derive the main sources of Chinese culture and civilization. It is in the voluminous Six Strategies that both ethical and pragmatic aspects of statecraft and strategy can be clearly seen, foreshad-owing the later teachings of Sun Wu and Sun Bin on strategic factors of leadership, order, and command. The original teachings of the Six Strategies on the subject of leadership include the whole person, from character, mentality, attitude, and conduct as an individual, to manners and techniques proper to professional management and leadership skills: Be calm and serene, gentle and moderate. Be generous, not contentious; be openhearted and evenminded. Treat people correctly. Don�t give arbitrary approval, yet don�t refuse out of mere contrariness. Arbitrary approval means loss of discipline, while refusal means shutting off. Look with the eyes of the whole world, and there is nothing you will not see. Listen with
