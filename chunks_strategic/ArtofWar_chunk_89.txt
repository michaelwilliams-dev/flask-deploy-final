back as trophies, besides immense spoils in the shape of horses and cattle and valuables of every description. Yarkand then capitulating, Kutcha and the other kingdoms drew off their respective forces. From that time forward, Pan Ch�ao�s prestige completely overawed the countries of the west." In this case, we see that the Chinese general not only kept his own officers in ignorance of his real plans, but actually took the bold step of dividing his army in order to deceive the enemy.] 1. By altering his arrangements and changing his plans, [Wang Hsi thinks that this means not using the same stratagem twice.] he keeps the enemy without definite knowledge. [Chang Yu, in a quotation from another work, says: "The axiom, that war is based on deception, does not apply only to deception of the enemy. You must deceive even your own soldiers. Make them follow you, but without letting them know why."] By shifting his camp and taking circuitous routes, he prevents the enemy from anticipating his purpose. 1. At the critical moment, the leader of an army acts like one who has climbed up a height and then kicks away the ladder behind him. He carries his men deep into hostile territory before he shows his hand. [Literally, "releases the spring" (see V. ss. 15), that is, takes some decisive step which makes it impossible for the army to return�like Hsiang Yu, who sunk his ships after crossing a river. Ch�en Hao, followed by Chia CHAPTER 12. THE NINE SITUATIONS 105 Lin, understands the words less well as "puts forth every artifice at his command."] 1. He burns his boats and breaks his cooking-pots; like a shepherd driving a flock of sheep, he drives his men this way and that, and nothing knows whither he is going. [Tu Mu says: "The army is only cognizant of orders to advance or retreat; it is ignorant of the ulterior ends of attacking and conquering."] 1. To muster his host and bring it into danger:�this may be termed the busi- ness of the general. [Sun Tzu means that after mobilization there should be no delay in aiming a blow at the enemy�s heart. Note how he returns again and again to this point. Among the warring states of ancient China, desertion was no doubt a much more present fear and serious evil than it is in the armies of today.] 1. The different measures suited to the nine varieties of ground; [Chang Yu says: "One must not be hide-bound in interpreting the rules for the nine varieties of ground.] the expediency of aggressive or defensive tactics; and the fundamental laws of human nature: these are things that must most certainly be studied. 1. When invading hostile territory, the general principle is, that penetrating deeply brings cohesion; penetrating but a short way means dispersion. [Cf. supra, ss. 20.] 2. When you leave your own country behind, and take your army across neighborhood territory, you find yourself on critical ground. [This "ground" is
