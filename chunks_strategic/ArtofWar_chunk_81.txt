possession have the advantage over the other side. If a position of this kind is secured first by the enemy, beware of attacking him. Lure him away by pretending to flee� show your banners and sound your drums�make a dash for other places that he cannot afford to lose�trail brushwood and raise a dust�confound his ears and eyes�detach a body of your best troops, and place it secretly in ambuscade. Then your opponent will sally forth to the rescue."] 1. On open ground, do not try to block the enemy�s way. [Because the attempt would be futile, and would expose the blocking force itself to serious risks. There are two interpretations available here. I follow that of Chang Yu. The other is indicated in Ts�ao Kung�s brief note: "Draw closer together"�i.e., see that a portion of your own army is not cut off.] On the ground of intersecting highways, join hands with your allies. [Or perhaps, "form alliances with neighboring states."] 1. On serious ground, gather in plunder. [On this, Li Ch�uan has the following delicious note: "When an army pen- etrates far into the enemy�s country, care must be taken not to alienate the people by unjust treatment. Follow the example of the Han Emperor Kao Tsu, whose march into Ch�in territory was marked by no violation of wo- men or looting of valuables. [Nota bene: this was in 207 B.C., and may well cause us to blush for the Christian armies that entered Peking in 1900 A.D.] Thus he won the hearts of all. In the present passage, then, I think that the true reading must be, not �plunder,� but �do not plunder.�" Alas, I fear that in this instance the worthy commentator�s feelings outran his judgment. Tu Mu, at least, has no such illusions. He says: "When en- camped on �serious ground,� there being no inducement as yet to advance further, and no possibility of retreat, one ought to take measures for a pro- tracted resistance by bringing in provisions from all sides, and keep a close watch on the enemy."] In difficult ground, keep steadily on the march. [Or, in the words of VIII. ss. 2, "do not encamp.] 1. On hemmed-in ground, resort to stratagem. [Ts�au Kung says: "Try the effect of some unusual artifice;" and Tu Yu amplifies this by saying: "In such a position, some scheme must be de- vised which will suit the circumstances, and if we can succeed in deluding CHAPTER 12. THE NINE SITUATIONS 97 the enemy, the peril may be escaped." This is exactly what happened on the famous occasion when Hannibal was hemmed in among the moun- tains on the road to Casilinum, and to all appearances entrapped by the dictator Fabius. The stratagem which Hannibal devised to baffle his foes was remarkably like that which T�ien Tan had also employed with success exactly 62 years before.
