OBSERVANCE OFTHE LAW I In1910, aMr. Sam Geezil ofChicago sold hiswarehouse business forclose to$1million. Hesettled down tosemiretirement and themanagingofhis many properties,butdeepinside heitched fortheolddays ofdeal-making. One dayayoungman named JosephWeil visited hisoffice, wantingtobuy anapartmenthehadupforsale. Geezil explainedtheterms: Thepricewas $8,000, but heonly requiredadown payment of$2,000. Weil said he would sleeponit,buthecame back thefollowing dayand offered topay thefull$8,000 incash, ifGeezil could wait acoupleofdays,until adeal Weil wasworkingoncame through.Even insemiretirement, aclever busi- nessman like Geezil was curious astohow Weil would beable tocomeup with somuch cash(roughly $150,000 today)soquickly.Wei] seemed reluc- tant tosay, andquickly changed thesubject, butGeezil waspersistent.Fi- nally,after assurances ofconfidentiality,Weil told Geezil thefollowing story.

Hewould selltheproperty for$35,000 toaset- upman (whom itwas Weil’s jobtofind). The financiers were toowealthyto worryabout thislowprice.Theset-upman would then turn around and selltheproperty again foritsrealprice,around $155,000. The uncle, Weil, and thethird man would splittheprofitsfrom this second sale. Itwas all legaland for agoodcause—the uncle’s justretribution. Geezil had heard enough: Hewanted tobe the set-up buyer. Weil was reluctant toinvolve him, but Geezil would notback dovmz The idea ofa large profit, plusalittle adventure, had himchampingatthebit.Weil ex- plained that Geezil would have toputupthe$35,000 incash tobringthe deal off.Geezil,amillionaire, said hecould getthemoney with asnap of hisfingers.Weil finally relented andagreedtoarrangeameetingbetween theuncle, Geezil, and the financiers, inthetown ofGalesburg,Illinois.
