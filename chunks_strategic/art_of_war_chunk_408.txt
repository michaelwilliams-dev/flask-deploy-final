a well-seasoned warrior when he sat down to write his famous book, which according to my reckoning must have appeared towards the end, rather than the beginning of Ho Lu�s reign. The story of the women may possibly have grown out of some real incident occurring about the same time. As we hear no more of Sun Wu after this from any source, he is hardly likely to have survived his patron or to have taken part in the death-struggle with Yueh, which began with the disaster at Tsuili. If these inferences are approximately correct, there is a certain irony in the fate which decreed that China�s most illustrious man of peace should be contemporary with her greatest writer on war. 1.2 The Text of Sun Tzu I have found it difficult to glean much about the history of Sun Tzu�s text. The quo- tations that occur in early authors go to show that the "13 chapters" of which Ssu-ma Ch�ien speaks were essentially the same as those now extant. We have his word for it that they were widely circulated in his day, and can only regret that he refrained from discussing them on that account. Sun Hsing-yen says in his preface: During the Ch�in and Han dynasties Sun Tzu�s ART OF WAR was in general use amongst military commanders, but they seem to have treated it as a work of mysterious import, and were unwilling to expound it for the benefit of posterity. Thus it came about that Wei Wu was the first to write a commentary on it. As we have already seen, there is no reasonable ground to suppose that Ts�ao Kung tampered with the text. But the text itself is often so obscure, and the number of edi- tions which appeared from that time onward so great, especially during the T�ang and Sung dynasties, that it would be surprising if numerous corruptions had not managed 33With Wu Yuan himself the case is just the reverse: � a spurious treatise on war has been fathered on him simply because he was a great general. Here we have an obvious inducement to forgery. Sun Wu, on the other hand, cannot have been widely known to fame in the 5th century. 34From TSO CHUAN: "From the date of King Chao�s accession [515] there was no year in which Ch�u was not attacked by Wu." CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 16 to creep in. Towards the middle of the Sung period, by which time all the chief com- mentaries on Sun Tzu were in existence, a certain Chi T�ien-pao published a work in 15 CHUAN entitled "Sun Tzu with the collected commentaries of ten writers." There was another text, with variant readings put forward by Chu Fu of Ta-hsing, which also had supporters among the scholars of that period; but in the Ming editions, Sun Hsing- yen tells us, these readings were for some reason or other no longer put into circula- tion. Thus, until the end of the 18th century,
