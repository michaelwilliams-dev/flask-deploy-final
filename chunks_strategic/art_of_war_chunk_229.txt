have a long way to go. Their soldiers are worn out. Their generals are contemptuous and their officers inconsiderate. They neglect to make preparations. They do not form battle lines as they advance. When they do form battle lines, they are not stable. They are disorderly when they travel over rough terrain. There is discord between commanders and soldiers. They become arrogant when they win a battle. There is disorder in the ranks when they move their battle lines. The soldiers are tired and prone to upset. The army is supplied, but the people do not eat. Each man moves on his ownï¿½some go ahead, some lag behind. When opponents have the following qualities, however, withdraw and avoid them: Superiors are considerate and subordinates are obedient. Rewards are sure and punishments certain.

They have plenty of supplies and equipment. Their government and education are substantial. They are on good terms with all of their neighbors. They are backed by great nations. Psychological Configurations Some generals are brave and think lightly of death. Some are hasty and impulsive. Some are greedy and materialistic. Some are humane but lack endurance. Some are intelligent but timid. Some are intelligent but easygoing at heart. Those who are brave and think lightly of death are vulnerable to assault.

Those who are intelligent but timid are vulnerable to pressure. Those who are intelligent but easygoing are vulnerable to sudden attack. Orderly Troops In military operations, order leads to victory.
