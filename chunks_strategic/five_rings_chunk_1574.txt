Everyone’s actions were interdependent,andnothing and no one passedunnoticed: “The kingnotonlysaw toitthat allthehigh nobilitywaspresentathiscourt,” wrote Saint—Simon, “he demanded the same oftheminor nobility.Athis lever and voucher, athismeals, inhisgardensofVersailles, healways looked about him, noticing everything.He was offended ifthemost distinguished nobles did notlivepermanentlyatcourt, and those who showed them- selves never orhardly ever, incurred hisfulldispleasure. Ifoneofthese de sired something,thekingwouldsayproudly:‘Idonotknow him,’ and the judgmentwasirrevocable.” Interpretation Louis XIV came topowerattheend ofaterrible civil war, theFronde. A principal instigator ofthe war had been thenobility,which deeplyresented thegrowing power ofthethrone andyearned forthedays offeudalism, when thelords ruled their own fiefdoms and thekinghad little authority over them. The nobles had lostthecivil war, buttheyremained afractious, resentful lot. The construction ofVersailles, then, was far more than thedecadent whim ofaluxury—1oving king. Itserved acrucial function: Theking could keepaneyeand an ear oneveryoneandeverythingaround him. The once proud nobilitywas reduced tosquabblingover theright tohelpthe king putonhisrobes inthemorning. There was nopossibilityhere ofpm? vacy--no possibility ofisolation. Louis XIVvery early grasped thetruth thatfor akingtoisolate himself isgravely dangerous.Inhisabsence, con- spiracies willspring uplike mushrooms after rain, animosities willcrystal- lizeinto factions, and rebellion will break outbefore hehasthe time to react. Tocombat this,sociabilityand opennessmust notonly beencour- aged, theymust beformally organized and channeled. These conditions atVersailles lasted forLouis’s entire reign,some fifty years ofrelative peaceandtranquillity. Through itall,not apindropped without Louis hearingit. Solitude isdangeroustoreason, without being favorabletovirtue. . . . Remember that thesolitarymortal iscertainly luxurious, probabhv superstitious,andpossiblymad.
