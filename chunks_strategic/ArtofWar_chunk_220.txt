Annals� (Zuochuan) Part One The Way of the General Essays on Leadership and Crisis Management Zhuge Liang Translator�s Introduction Zhuge Liang, commonly known by his style, Kongming, was born around the year 180, the son of a provincial official in the latter days of the Han dynasty. At that time, the dynasty was thoroughly decrepit, nearly four hundred years old and on the verge of collapse. For most of his adult life, Zhuge was to play a major role in the power struggles and civil wars that followed the demise of the ancient Han. Orphaned at an early age, he and his younger brother were taken in by an uncle, a local governor in southern China. When this uncle was replaced with another officer, he and his charges went to join an old family friend, a member of the powerful Liu clan who was currently a governor in central China. The imperial house of Han was a branch of the greater Liu clan, which as a whole retained considerable wealth, prestige, and influence even after the passing of the Han dynasty itself. Zhuge Liang�s uncle died during his sojourn in central China. Then in his twenties, Zhuge stayed there, supporting himself by farming. According to Records of the Three Kingdoms, at this early age Zhuge was aware of his own genius, but few took him seriously; he was, after all, an orphan and subsistence farmer. His fortunes took a turn, however, when the great warrior Liu Bei, founder of the kingdom of Shu in western China, garrisoned in the area where Zhuge Liang was living. Zhuge was recommended to the warrior chief by a member of the influential Xu clan, which produced many outstanding Taoists of the early churches. According to Records of the Three Kingdoms, Zhuge�s friend said to Liu Bei, �Zhuge Kongming is a dragon in repose�would you want to meet him?� Liu Bei said, �You come with him.� The friend said, �It is possible to go see this man, but you cannot make him come to you. You, General, should go out of your way to look in on him.� The record states that Liu Bei finally went to see Zhuge Liang, adding that he had to go no fewer than three times before the young genius agreed to meet the warrior chieftain. When at length they were together, the record continues, Liu Bei dismissed everyone else so that he could be alone with Zhuge Liang. Then he said, �The house of Han is collapsing; treacherous officials are usurping authority; the emperor is blinded by the dust.� The warlord went on to solicit Zhuge�s advice, and Zhuge became one of his top strategists. The story of this famous meeting is related in the first of Liu Ji�s war tales. The intrigues of the era of the Three Kingdoms are too complex to detail here; indeed, they fill the one hundred chapters of the massive neoclassic historical novel Tales of the Three Kingdoms. Suffice it to say here
