In The Prince Machiavelli frequently refers with approval to Caesar Borgia (under his title Duke Valentine), and he has of sometimes been called 'Machiavelli's Perfect Prince'; but this is hardly fair to the author. Machiavelli first came into touch with Caesar on one of his diplomatic missions, and he was with this of of tyrant at the time his greatest triumph treachery when he succeeded in entrapping all his captains who had recently re.volted against him "and immediately put them to death.
