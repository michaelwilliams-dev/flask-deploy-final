opponent, then you should retreat and watch for an opening. Master Sun Therefore if the smaller side is stubborn, it becomes the captive of the larger side. LI QUAN If the smaller side battles stubbornly without taking its strength into account, it will surely be captured by the larger side. MENG SHI The small cannot stand up to the large�this means that if a small country does not assess its power and dares to become the enemy of a large country, no matter how firm its defenses be, it will inevitably become a captive nation. The Spring and Autumn Annals say, �If you cannot be strong, and yet cannot be weak, this will result in your defeat.� HO YANXI Ho Yanxi told the story of Right General Su Jian of the Han dynasty, a vice- general in the wars with the invading Huns of ancient times. Right General Su and Forward General Zhao of the Forward Army were leading a division of several thousand troops when he encountered a Hunnish force ten times as large. They fought all day, until the Chinese army was decimated. Now Forward General Zhao, a foreigner who had earlier surrendered to the Chinese in exchange for rank and title, was invited by the Huns to join them, so he took the rest of his mounted troops, about eight hundred or so, and surrendered to the Shanyu, the Hunnish chieftain. Right General Su, now having lost his entire army, was at a loss to know where to go, being the sole survivor. The great general asked several of his top advisers what to do about the case of Right General Su. One said, �We have not executed a single vice-general on this campaign. Now this Su Jian has deserted his army�we should execute him to show how serious we are.� But another said, �No, that is not right. The rule of martial arts says that it is the very stubbornness of the smaller side that makes it the captive of the larger side. Now this Su was alone with a few thousand troops when he ran into the Shanyu with a few tens of thousands; he fought hard for over a day, not daring to have any other thought as long as any of his soldiers were left. If we execute him now that he has come back by himself, this would be showing people there is no sense in returning!� Master Sun Generals are assistants of the nation. When their assistance is complete, the country is strong. When their assistance is defective, the country is weak. CAO CAO When the generals are completely thorough, their plans do not leak out. If they are defective, their formations are revealed outside. JIA LIN The strength or weakness of a country depends on its generals. If the generals help the leadership and are thoroughly capable, then the country will be strong. If the generals do not help the leadership, and harbor duplicity in their hearts, then the country
