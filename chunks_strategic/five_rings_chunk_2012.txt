crucial test, for, ifthehighest activity ofthecity isidentical tothe highest activity ofman, there isnojustification forgoing beyond the city, forrebellion inheart ordeed.The status ofthecitydepends on thisattempt. Now Socrates proceeds totrytomake public orcommon every- thing thatremains private. Fullcommunism, from Socrates' point of view theonlyform ofjustregime, requires notonly theabolition of private property butalsothesharing ofwomen andchildren andthe ruleofphilosophers. Women, family, andphilosophy areallofthedo- main oftheerotic, which seems tobewhat ismost intransigently private. Uptonowwhat Socrates hassuggested hasbeen severe, but notoutlandish. The city ismerely animproved Sparta, correcting its worst vices, while preserving itsvirtues. Hehasadopted theopinions ofhiswell-born Laconophile interlocutors; Adeimantus isattached to Sparta because itisaustere, secure, and aristocratic; Glaucon because itiswarlike. Socrates hasimproved ontheSpartan regime bystopping theruling classfrom persecuting thepoor,bysuppressing thesecret lustforwealth, andbymoderating theexclusive orientation towar.At thesame time,hehassoftened thewarlike temper ofthemenandgiven them thepossibility ofacertain openness. Nowhemust takeadvantage ofthat possibility andattempt toinfuse theAthenian element intothe Spartan regime. Inorder tocomplete hiswork, hewillhave toface three fantastic waves which threaten toengulf him.The firsttwo waves— thesamewayoflifeforwomen asmenandthecommunity of wives andchildren— havenever existed inreality orinthethoughts of serious men; they aretheabsurd conceits ofacomic poetwhoonlysug- gested them inorder toridicule them.Andthelastwave, theruleof philosophers, isatotal innovation, beyond thewildest thoughts ofthat same comic poetwhohadalsoridiculed philosophy. BookVispreposterous, andSocrates expects ittoberidiculed. It provokes both laughter andrage initscontempt forconvention and nature, initswounding ofallthedearest sensibilities ofmasculine pride andshame, thefamily, andstatesmanship andthecity.Assuch it canonlybeunderstood asSocrates' response tohismostdangerous ac- cuser, Aristophanes, andhiscontest with him. IntheEcclesiazusae Aristophanes hadattacked thepublic inthename oftheprivate, andin theClouds hehadattacked philosophy inthename ofpoetry. Here Soc- rates suggests that, ifphilosophy rules, thepolitical cantriumph over 380] Interpretive Essay theprivate life. Ifheisright, hecanshow thatAristophanes didnot understand thecitybecause hedidnotunderstand philosophy, andhe didnotunderstand philosophy because hedidnotunderstand that philosophy could grasp thehuman things andparticularly thecity.The Republic isthe firstbook ofpolitical philosophy, andattempts toshow that4>hilosophy canshed lightonhuman things asnoother discipline can. Socrates isthefounder ofthecity inspeech and, hence, ofpo- litical philosophy. InBookVhetries toshow thesuperiority ofthe philosopher tothecomic poet indeed; hedoes sobyproducing acom- edywhich ismore fantastic, more innovative, more comic, andmore profound thananywork ofAristophanes. Socrates with anairofut- most seriousness undertakes absurd considerations; inthisheisalready comic. Ifwhatheappears toteach seriously isimpossible, asAvillprove tobethecase, Socrates' comedy Avillbeakin totheEcclesiazusae. In that play thewomen ofAthens trytoinstitute what isjustbut politically impossible, andthereby they create ridiculous situations; Soc- rates surpasses them byradicalizing their proposals. Iftheperfection ofthecitycannot comprehend theperfection ofthesoul, thecity will lookugly incomparison tothesoul's beauty andbeaproper subject of comedy; itspretensions willbeludicrous. Such acomedy willbeadi- vinecomedy, onecalling foramore divine laughter. Only philosophy could produce it,for,asSocrates willexplain, onlyphilosophy hasthe true standard ofbeauty. Inappearing todisagree with Aristophanes about the city, Socrates shows thatonlyheknows thetruegrounds of itsinadequacy. Plato believes that hisSocrates canargue better about manthanAristophanes, andthat hisarguments canculminate inbetter comedies. Ifthisproves tobetrue, thetotal superiority ofSocrates and hiswayoflife Avillbemanifest. Socrates proposes thatwomen should have thesame education andwayoflifeasthemen; there should beafullequality ofthesexes, andthey must, asitwere, share thesame locker room. Socrates is aware thatpoets Avilllaugh atthisproposal andthat itAvillbeasubject ofridicule formen likeAristophanes. ButSocrates asserts thatthe comic poets areinthismerely serving Greek convention, either be- cause theycannot themselves transcend convention, orbecause theyare dependent onanaudience ofGreek men towhom theymust appeal. Once Greeks, likethebarbarians, were ashamed toseeeach other naked, buttheywere able toovercome thatshame.Anakedmanwould look ridiculous inacrowd ofclothed men, tobesure, butwhyshould menbeclothed?
