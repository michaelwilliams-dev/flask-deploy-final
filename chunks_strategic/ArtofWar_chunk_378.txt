The term ke is also pronounced ie and means �house,� �family,� and also �clan.� Here, by an extension of the sense of �clan,� it designates the class of warriors. The terms bushi, �warriors� or �samurai,� and buke should be distinguished. 1. Suki mono or suki sha: from suki, �art of living that includes the art of tea,� and mono or sha, �man.� This term is no longer in use today. 2.
