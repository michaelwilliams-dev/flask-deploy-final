who repeat that trite proverb: "Who counts on the populace builds on mud." This may be the case when a man of the people counts on them and promises to liberate them from the oppression of enemies and magistrates. Such a person may be deceived, as were the Gracchi in Rome (2nd century B.C.), and as was Giorgio Scali in Florence (d. 1382). But, when a Prince who can rule as a man of valor, who avoids disaster, who is otherwise prepared, who serves the universal common good, if he he counts on the populace, will never be deceived and will have built on a solid good. to Princes rising from a civil an absolute Principality should be aware. Either they are alone in arms or command through magistrates. In the latter case they are weaker and at greater risk because they depend on the people who follow the magistrates. The magistrates, in difficult times, can easily withdraw the sup- or to port of the state, act against the Prince, refuse obey. The Prince cannot quickly seize absolute power. The citizens and sub.jects, used the commands of the magistrates, and in cases to of conflict, won't obey the Prince. They will always doubt him in difficult times. Such a Prince cannot rely on things as they are when there is peace and people count on the Prince. Then they want to do and promise everything for him, and � when there is no danger �to die for him. But in difficult times, when the state needs the support of its citizens, few come forward. This is more dangerous the more exceptional the need. So a Prince needs to find a way to make the citizens at all times in all ways dependent on the state and on him, and only then will they remain faithful. HOW TO MEASURE THE STRENGTH OF PRINCIPALITIES It is important in evaluating Principalities to know whether a Prince controls enough state so that, in need, he can defend himself or rather if he always needs the defenses of others. To make this clear I will say how I judge those who can defend themselves, namely, by whether they can call up enough men and draw on enough money to mount a good army and do battle with any aggressor. Others always need other people's reinforcements, can't field a force against the enemy battle, and need take in to refuge behind walls at the mercy of others. Of those ready to do battle, we will speak further. Of the others who rely on third par.ties, we can only say they need fortify and stock themselves, to the and forget about open territory. Those who fortifies them.selves well and who governs according to the rules, will only be attacked with considerable circumspection. Men dislike difficult undertakings. They do not see making an easy assault where the Prince rules proudly and is not hated by the populace. German cities are pretty free, don't control much countryside, obey the
