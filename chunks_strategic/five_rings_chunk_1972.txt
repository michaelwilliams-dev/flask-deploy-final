Socrates wasaccused ofdoing unjust things—ofnotbelieving in thegodswhich thecitybelieved inandofcorrupting theyouth. These charges donotrelate simply tothemanSocrates whohappens tobea philosopher butaremeant tobeacondemnation ofthephilosophic ac- tivity itself— andnotonbehalf simply ofthecityofAthens, buton behalf ofthepolitical community assuch.From the city's point of view, there seems tobesomething about thethought andwayoflifeof thephilosopher which calls intoquestion thecity's gods,who arethe protectors ofitslaws, andwhich hence makes himabad citizen, or rather nocitizen atall.Such aman's presence inthecityandhisasso- ciation with themost promising young menmake him asubversive. Socrates isunjust notonlybecause hebreaks Athens' lawsbutalsobe- cause heapparently doesnotaccept those fundamental beliefs which make civil society possible. Philosophy required adefense ifitwas tobeadmitted into civil society. AtthetimeofSocrates' trial,philosophy wasnew tothecities, and itcould easily havebeen crushed. Thephilosopher hadtodefend himself before the city, orthecitywould havebeen legitimated in discouraging philosophy's entrance into itasvigorously aspossible. Soc- [307 ] THEREPUBLIC rates' trialwasthecrisis ofphilosophy, and itslifewas atstake.And contrary towhatmodem menmight beinclined tobelieve, itisnot simply clear thatphilosophy issalutary, oreven harmless, forthecity. Socrates indicates thisbythefactthatheisatpains intheApology to distinguish himself from other philosophers. Heseems toagree that it issomewhat questionable whether acitywhich wants itssons tocare for itshould permit them toconsort with philosophers. The cityseesonlytheapparent atheism ofthephilosopher andhis effect ontheyoung; thepoet Aristophanes, who ridiculed Socrates in theClouds andpaved theway forhislater official accusation, shows' whythephilosopher issubversive. Hedepicts Socrates asaman"who hasinvestigated allthethings intheairandunder theearthandwho makes theweaker argument stronger." Themeaning ofthischarge is thatthephilosopher studies nature, particularly theheavens, andthere hefinds atrueaccount ofthecelestial phenomena differing widely from thatgiven inthereligious myths; forexample, helearns ofa purely mechanical explanation ofZeus' thunderbolt. Thephilosopher's contemplation oftheheavens dissolves theperspective ofthecity, the lawsofwhichnowseem tobemere conventions withnonatural status. Hiswayoflifeturnshimfrom theduties ofcitizenship, andwhat he learns teaches himtodespise thehuman, political things. What ismore, thephilosopher's understanding ofthecauses ofallthings makes itim- possible forhimtograspmanonhisown level;man isreduced tonon- man, thepolitical tothesubpolitical. Thephilosophers arealienated from thehuman things, which onlypoetry canadequately reproduce. Thepoet, inamoreprofound way, joins thecity initscondemnation of philosophy asanenemy ofpolitical man. Socrates must show, then, thatthephilosopher isjustandthat itis he,notthepoet,who istheoneable totreat ofpolitical things respon- sibly. This isnoteasy todosince itwould appear thatthephilosopher calls intoquestion thenatural character ofjustice asavirtue andthat hisscience ofbeing hasnospecial place forman init.TheApology doesnotadequately accomplish thistask, since itisadescription ofSoc- rates' lifedirected toalarge, hostile audience composed ofgenerally ignorant jurors sworn touphold thedefective laws ofAthens. The Republic, ontheother hand, isaleisurely discussion among cultivated, friendly men.TheApology, inwhich Socrates defends himself against thecharge ofinjustice, makes noattempt todefine justice: hisaccusers mean byanunjustmanonewhobreaks thelaws;andSocrates' justice issurely
