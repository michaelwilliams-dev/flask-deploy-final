provided al.ways that their crimes were crowned with success. Of these the most notorious was Caesar Borgia, one of of whom we hear so much from Machiavelli. An illegitimate son of the infamous Pope Alexander VI, he enjoyed a short-lived by vio.in lent career, excelling even his contemporaries duplicity, treachery, and cold-blooded murders. By his personal courage and unscrupulous conduct, and with the strong support of his fa- he ther, succeeded in creating a powerful state comprising the whole of Romagna and a great part of central Italy, and at one time it looked as though he might dominate the whole peninsula; 16-Niccolï¿½ Machiavelli but Alexander's sudden death found Caesar himself incapacitated by illness , his carefully laid plans for consolidating his power in this crisis came to nothing, he fell into the hands of his enemies , losing the whole of his newly-acquired kingdom , and he was never able thereafter to recover any position of importance. Long before Machiavelli's time certain districts in Italy had emerged from the general confusion in the form of comparatively permanent and powerful states . The so -called Republic of Flor.ence, under the veiled autocracy of the Medici , was the master of the greater part of Tuscany. The many small republics of Lom. bardy had been welded together by the Visconti and Sforza into the Duchy of Milan .

Machiavelli was born at Florence in 1469 and lived till 1527 . During his youth he saw the Florentine republic at the height of her power and prosperity under the sway of Lorenzo the Magnifi. cent, and for the time being Italy was enjoying a short period of comparative peace , largely due to Lorenzo's diplomatic influ. ence ; but such tranquility could not be expected to last, and on Lorenzo's death in 1492 , Italy quickly relapsed into her former state of chaos , which was won to be aggravated by a series of in.vasions by her more warlike northern neighbors . In 1594 Charles VIII of France made his irruption into Italy to make good his claim to Naples against the House of Aragon , and so helpless was the country to defend herself against attack , that he was
