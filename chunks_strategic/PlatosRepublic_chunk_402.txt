by the separation from the body. For all men other than the philosopher, there is a constant change of fortune from happiness to misery and back. The myth attributes fu]] responsibility to men for what happens to them and thus teaches that there is no sin but ignorance. The key to Er's account of his visit to the other world is the ab? sence of Achilles. He says that Ajax was the twentieth soul he saw. Ajax was the twentieth shade seen by Odysseus on his voyage to Hades; one of the shades which accompanied Ajax and the one with which Odysseus spoke just prior to speaking with Ajax was that of Achi11es, who at that point made his complaint about Hades quoted at the beginning of Book III. Er makes no mention of whom he saw with Ajax. Achilles no longer exists, alive or dead, in the new poetry or the new Socratic world. Cor? respondingly, the wise voyager Odysseus gains higher status. All he needed was to be cured oflove of honor (a form of spiritedness), and he could Jive the obscure but happy life of Socrates. In this Socrates also gets his inspiration from Homer, and thus he Jets us know that there may be another side to Homer's poetry than that which the tradition had popularized. At all events, the teaching of the myth is a strictly human one-man in this life, without being other worldly-can attain self? sufficient happiness in the exercise of his natural powers and only in this way will he partake of eternity to the extent a human being can do so. Otherwise stated, only the �philosopher has no need of the myth. On this note the discussion ends, G]aucon having learned his lesson in moderation, and Socrates thereby having made his apology? the apology of a man who benefits others because he first of all knows how to benefit himself. NOTES Book I 1. "Republic" is the English equivalent of Cicero's Latin translation of the Greek title Politeia. The word does not convey precisely the correct connota? tion to us, although the great weight of the tradition hinders us from changing the English rendition of the title itself. The word politeia is ultimately derived from polis (by way of polites, citizen), as are many of the important political terms in Plato's vocabulary. The polis is the city, the community of men sharing a way of life and governing themselves, waging war and preserving the peace.JThe polis is the natural social group, containing aH that is necessary for the development and exercise of the human powers.{f oday polis is usuaHy translated as "city-state"; this is done because it is recognized that a polis is not a state in the modem � sense (for example, state as distinguished from society), and that the character of ancient political life was radically different from our own. However, to translate polis as "city-state" implies that our notion of state is somehow con? tained in that of
