the precise sense was agreed to be a ruler of bodies and not a money-maker. Wasn't it so agreed?" He assented. "And was the pilot in the precise sense agreed to be a ruler of sailors and not a sailor?" b. "It was agreed." "Then such a pilot and ruler will consider or command the benefit not of the pilot, but of the man who is a sailor and is ruled." He assented with resistance. "Therefore, Thrasymachus," I said, "there isn't ever anyone who holds any position of rule, insofar as he is ruler, who considers or commands his own advantage rather than that of what is ruled and of which he himself is the craftsman; and it is looking to this and what is advantageous and fitting for it that he says everything he says and does 342 1 everything he does." When we came to this point in the argument and it was evident to 343 1 everyone that the argument about the just had turned around in the op- posite direction, Thrasymachus, instead of answering, said, "Tell me, Socrates, do you have a wet nurse?" ï¿½ "Why this?" I said. "Shouldn't you answer instead of asking such things?" "Because," he said, "you know she neglects your sniveling nose and doesn't give it the wiping you need, since it's her fault you do not even recognize sheep or shepherd." "Because of what, in particular?" I said. "Because you suppose shepherds or cowherds consider the good of the sheep or the cows and fatten them and take care of them looking to something other than their masters' good and their own; and so you also believe that the rulers in the cities, those who truly rule, think about the ruled differently from the way a man would regard sheep, and that night and day they consider anything else than how they will benefit themselves. And you are so far off about the just and justice, and the unjust and injustice, that you are unaware that justice and the just are really someone else's good, the advantage of the man who is stronger and rules, and a personal harm to the man who obeys and serves. Injustice is the opposite, and it rules the truly simple and just; and those who are ruled do what is advantageous for him who is stronger, and they make him whom they serve happy but themselves not at all. And this must be considered, most simple Socrates: the just man everywhere has less than the unjust man. First, in contracts, when the just man is a partner of the unjust man, you will always find that at the dissolution of the partnership the just man does not have more than the unjust man, but less. Second, in matters pertaining to the city, when there are taxes, the just man pays more on the basis of equal proper? ty, the unjust man less; and when there are distributions, the one makes no profit, the other
