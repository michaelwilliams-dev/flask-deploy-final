OBSERVANCE OFTHE LAW H Thegreat escapeartist Harry Houdini once advertised hisact as“The lm~ possible Possible." And indeed those who witnessed hisdramaticescapes feltthat what hedidonstage contradicted commonsense ideas ofhuman capacity.

They contained six setsoflocks and nine tumblers ineach cuff; aBirminghammaker hadspentfiveyearscon- structingthem. Experts who examined them saidtheyhad never seen any- thingsointricate, and thisintricacywasthoughttomake them impossible toescape. The crowd watched theexpertssecure the manacles onHoudini’s wrists.
