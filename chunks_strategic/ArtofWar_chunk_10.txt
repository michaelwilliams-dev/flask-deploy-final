easy to see how yet another general could have played a very prominent part in the same campaign. Ch�en Chen-sun of the Sung dynasty has the note: Military writers look upon Sun Wu as the father of their art. But the fact that he does not appear in the TSO CHUAN, although he is said to have served under Ho Lu King of Wu, makes it uncertain what period he really belonged to. He also says: The works of Sun Wu and Wu Ch�i may be of genuine antiquity. It is noticeable that both Yeh Shui-hsin and Ch�en Chen-sun, while rejecting the per- sonality of Sun Wu as he figures in Ssu-ma Ch�ien�s history, are inclined to accept the date traditionally assigned to the work which passes under his name. The author of the HSU LU fails to appreciate this distinction, and consequently his bitter attack on Ch�en Chen-sun really misses its mark. He makes one of two points, however, which certainly tell in favor of the high antiquity of our "13 chapters." "Sun Tzu," he says, 24About 480 B.C. 25That is, I suppose, the age of Wu Wang and Chou Kung. 26In the 3rd century B.C. 27Ssu-ma Jang-chu, whose family name was T�ien, lived in the latter half of the 6th century B.C., and is also believed to have written a work on war. See SHIH CHI, ch. 64, and infra at the beginning of the INTRODUCTION. CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 12 "must have lived in the age of Ching Wang [519-476], because he is frequently pla- giarized in subsequent works of the Chou, Ch�in and Han dynasties." The two most shameless offenders in this respect are Wu Ch�i and Huai-nan Tzu, both of them im- portant historical personages in their day. The former lived only a century after the alleged date of Sun Tzu, and his death is known to have taken place in 381 B.C. It was to him, according to Liu Hsiang, that Tseng Shen delivered the TSO CHUAN, which had been entrusted to him by its author.28 Now the fact that quotations from the ART OF WAR, acknowledged or otherwise, are to be found in so many authors of differ- ent epochs, establishes a very strong anterior to them all, � in other words, that Sun Tzu�s treatise was already in existence towards the end of the 5th century B.C. Further proof of Sun Tzu�s antiquity is furnished by the archaic or wholly obsolete meanings attaching to a number of the words he uses. A list of these, which might perhaps be extended, is given in the HSU LU; and though some of the interpretations are doubtful, the main argument is hardly affected thereby. Again, it must not be forgotten that Yeh Shui- hsin, a scholar and critic of the first rank, deliberately pronounces the style of the 13 chapters to belong to the early part of the fifth century. Seeing that he is actually engaged in an attempt to disprove the existence of Sun Wu
