Machiavelli was also writing theDiscourses upon theFirst Decade ofLivy atthesame time asThePrince, andhebegan TheArtofWar soon afterwards. These three books arecomplementary toeach other, working outdifferent aspects of thesame problem. IntheDiscourses hereviewed various forms ofgovernment, buttreated principally ofrepublics; inThePrince hewasmainly occupied with thequalities necessary fortheruler ofnew state andthemethods ofgovernment thatheshould em- ploy, amatter only briefly dealt with intheDiscourses; while in TheArtofWar heelaborated hisideas astotheneed ofanational militia tosupport either prince orrepublic, astothemethods of itsformation andtraining, andastotheprinciples oftactical war- fare. Itwould bedifficult toexaggerate theimportance ofthenew ideas contributed byMachiavelli's genius. Astheauthor ofthe Discourses andThePrince hewas thefounder ofpolitical sci- ence inasmuch ashewas thefirst toanalyze various forms of government thathadexisted andtoinquire how they hadworked inpractice, asopposed tothephilosophical method ofdevising ideal forms ofgovernment under ideal conditions; while TheArt ofWar hasbeen recognized bymodern military experts ashaving thefirst ofmodern classics onmilitary matters.’ Moreover, in writing TheHistory ofFlorence ‘heshowed equal originality, and instead offollowing hispredecessors inproducing mere chroni- clesofevents intheorder oftheir happening, hecreated themod- ernhistorical method bygiving such anaccount ofevents asto bring outtheir hidden causes, their inter-dependence, andtheir ef- fective results. ThePrince, however, being themost striking ofallhisworks, anditsprecepts most open tochallenge, hasnaturally attracted thegreatest attention, anditisnoexaggeration tosaythatfrom thetime itwaspublished uptothepresent dayithasnever ceased tobethesubject ofeager discussion andcriticism from every possible standpoint. Although written with special reference to thecondition ofItaly atthetime, andwith theobject ofstirring 22— Niccolò Machiavelli upItalians tofacetheproblems confronting them, itis,ofcourse, themore general application oftheprinciples laiddown inthe book which hasmade itofpermanent importance, andwhich has ledtosomuch violent criticism even tothepoint ofattacks on Machiavelli’s personal character. Much oftheconduct cited with approval inthiswork and many ofthemethods recommended areobviously immoral when judged bypresent-day standards, although Machiavelli's contem- poraries apparently found nothing inthem toshock their con- science. TheChurch attacked thebook ontheground thatitwas irreligious, andin1553 itwasplaced ontheIndex, together with allMachiavelli's other works; forwhile Machiavelli didinfact maintain thenecessity ofsome form ofreligion andofthestrict observance ofitsrites andceremonies asbeing essential forthe stability ofastate, itwas impossible tolook upon therules of conduct herecommended asanything butanti-Christian. ButThePrince isnotconcerned with either religion ormoral- ity,asMachiavelli would have been thefirsttopoint out;itdeals with thescience ofpractical government, andtheproblem isto form ajustestimate ofthetruth orfalsity ofMachiavelli's propo- sitions. How dothemethods ofgovernment advocated byMa- chiavelli work inpractice? Ishispsychology sound? Ishisview oftheinherent baseness ofhuman nature correct? How farhave hisrules ofconduct been adopted with success bysuch modern creators ofnew states asBismarck, Lenin andMussolini? These
