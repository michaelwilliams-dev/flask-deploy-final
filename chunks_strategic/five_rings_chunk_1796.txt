raised topower have novirtue besides what they have from for- tune, they fall. Only those with virtue know how toconserve what hasbeen given them andcanmake upafterwards what oth- ershave from thestart. Iwould likeintalking about oneortheother wayofbecom- ingaPrince, either byvirtue orfortune, toallude totwoexamples from ourtimes —Francesco Sforza andCesare Borgia. Fran- cesco Sforza with theright means andgreat virtue became onhis own Duke ofMilan. What hewon with great trouble hemain- tained with ease. Cesare Borgia, ontheother hand, called Duke Valentin bythepopulace, acquired hisstate ofRomagna with his 52— Niccolò Machiavelli father's help, andlostitthesame way. This notwithstanding that onhisbehalf everything thataprudent andvirtuous man could do wasdone, allthatarms orfortune could do,toputroots intothe state. AsIsaid, whosoever lacks thebasics beforehand canwith great virtue build them upafterwards, even though itcosts the leader something andputs thebuilding atrisk. Ifyouconsider the Duke's progress, youwillseeheprepared thefoundation forfu- ture power, which should bementioned, because Iknow ofno other newPrince who better exemplified theright course with his actions. That hefailed wasduenottohisown fault butbecause ofextraordinary badluck. Alexander VIfaced both imminent andfuture dangers in wanting tomake theDuke hissongreat. First, hesawnowayof giving himarealm except bypassing aChurch estate. Taking one from theChurch would arouse theDuke ofMilan andtheVene- tians. Faenza andRimini were under theprotectorate oftheVene- tians. Besides, thearms ofItaly, especially those thatcould serve others, were inthehands ofthose who feared thePapacy. Be- sides, onecould nottrust them because they were accomplices of theOrsinis andColomas. Itwasneedful therefore toupset their states andcause disorder among them toinsinuate oneself into their territories. This waseasy because theVenetians, forreasons oftheir own, wanted tobring theFrench intoItaly again. This wasmade easier bythedissolution ofKing Louis' marriage. SotheKing entered Italy with thesupport oftheVenetians andtheconsent ofAlexander. Nosooner washeinMilan than thePope approached himabout Romagna —which wasagreed on,forthefurther glory oftheKing. When theDuke then won over Romagna anddefeated theColonnas, twothings blocked himfrom proceeding further: one, hisown armies, which were notloyal; theother, thewillofFrance. Namely, theforces ofthe Orsini hadlefthimandnotonly blocked newacquisition butalso took away from himwhat hehadalready won. Hewasafraid that theKing would dothesame. Faenza attacked Bologna butthe Orsini pulled offtheir forces. HesawtheKing's hand when after taking Urbino, theDuke assaulted Tuscany, buttheKing made THE PRINCE —53 him stop. The Duke saw hecould notdepend anymore onthe arms orfortunes ofothers. Atfirst, thisweakened theOrsini andColonna parties in Rome. Their followers, noblemen, who were successful through them helped them hold Rome andthey received honors andmili- taryposts. Butinafewmonths, their loyalties were strained and theyturned totheDuke. Heawaited theopportunity tocutoffthe heads oftheOrsini after disbanding theColonnas —who then came over tohisside, andwhom hetreated well. The Orsinis were latetoseethattheambitions oftheDuke andtheChurch were their ruin, finally convening theConference ofMaglione in Perugia from which sprang therebellion ofUrbino andriots in Romagna andother dangers fortheDuke. These heovercame with thehelp oftheFrench. Hisreputation regained, nortrusting theFrench northeother parties, fearing they would turn onhim, heresorted tointrigue. Hewas sogood atdissembling thateven theOrsinis, through Paolo Orsini, reconciled themselves with him. The Duke made every effort toreassure them, giving them offices, money, uni- forms andhouses. This was sosuccessful thattheir incredulity ledthem into hishands atSinigaglia where their chiefs were killed andtheir partisans reduced. This laidthegroundwork for theDuke's position; now inpossession ofRomagna and the Duchy ofUrbino, hewasstrong. Itseemed asifhehadgotten the friendship
