wayshad the upperhand. Noone, not even his own wife, ever feltthey understood him, and hetherefore seemed larger than life.This also meant that thepublic paidconstant attention tohim, ever anxious towitness his next move. Ifyoursocial position prevents youfrom completely wrapping your actions inmystery, youmust atleast learn tomake yourself less obvious. Everynow andthen, actinaway that does notmesh with other people’s perception ofyou. Thisway youkeep those around youonthedefensive, elicitingthekind ofattention that makesyoupowerful. Done right, theore ation ofenigma.can also draw thekind ofattention that strikes terror into your enemy. During theSecond Punic War (219402 13.0.), thegreat Carthaginian general Hannibal waswreaking havoc inhismarch onRome. Hannibal wasknown forhiscleverness andduplicity. Under hisleadership Carthage’s army, though smaller than those of theRomans, had constantly outmaneuvered them. On one occasion, though, Hann1‘bal’s scouts made ahorrible blunder, leadinghistroopsinto amarshy terrain with the sea attheir back. The Roman army blocked the mountainpassesthat ledinland, and itsgeneral, Fabius, was ecstatic-at last hehad Hannibal trapped. Postinghisbest sentries onthepasses,he worked on aplantodestroy Hannibal’s forces. But inthemiddle ofthe night,thesentries looked down tosee amysterious sight: Ahuge proces- sion oflightswasheading upthemountain. Thousands and thousands of lights. Ifthis wasHannibal’s army, ithadsuddenly grownahundredfold. The sentries argued heatedlyabout what this could mean: Reinforce- ments from the sea?Troopsthat had been hidden inthearea? Ghosts? No explanationmade sense. Asthey watched, fires broke outallover themountain, and ahorrible noise drified uptothem from below, like theblowing ofamillion horns. Demons, they thought.The sentries, thebravest and most sensible inthe Romanarmy,fledtheir postsinapanic. Bythenext day,Hannibal hadescapedfrom themarshland. What was histrick? Had hereally conjured updemons? Actuallywhat hehad done wasorder bundles oftwigstobefastened tothehorns ofthethousands of oxen that traveled with histroopsasbeasts ofburden. Thetwigswere then LAW6353 lit,giving theimpressionofthetorches ofavast army heading upthe mountain. When theflames burned down totheoxen’s skin, they stam- pededinalldirections, bellowing like mad andsettingfires allover the mountainside. Thekeytothis device’s success was not thetorches, the fires, orthenoises inthemselves, however, butthefact that Hannibal had created apuzzlethatcaptivated thesentries’ attention andgraduallyterri- fied them. From themountaintop there was nowaytoexplainthis bizarre sight. Ifthesentries could have explained itthey would have stayed attheir posts. Ifyoufindyourself trapped, cornered, and onthedefensive insome situation, tryasimple experiment: Dosomething that cannot beeasilyex- plainedorinterpreted. Choose asimple action, butcarryitoutinaway that unsettles your opponent,awaywithmany possible interpretations, making yourintentions obscure. Don’t just beunpredictable (although this tactic too canbesuccessful—see Law 17);likeHannibal, create ascene that cannot beread. There will seem tobenomethod toyour madness, no rhymeorreason, nosingle explanation. Ifyou dothisright, youwill in- spire fear andtremblingand thesentries will abandon theirposts. Call it the“feignedmadness ofHamlet” tactic, forHamlet uses ittogreat effect in Shakespeare‘s play, frightening hisstepfather Claudius through the mys- tery ofhisbehavior. The mysterious makesyourforces seem larger, your powermore terrifying. Image: The Dance of the \/'cils~-—-thcz veils envelopthe dancer.
