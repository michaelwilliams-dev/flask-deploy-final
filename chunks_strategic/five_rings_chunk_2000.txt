Butthedifference between themad Achilles andtheSocrates whose death isdepicted inthePhaedo isthemeasure ofthedifference between thetwosources ofthat mastery. Socrates' death and the mysterious power itreveals arethenewmodel oftheheroic andmust replace theAchillean one.

Only here, inBelmont, isthereharmony andbeauty. IdthisUtopia, love reigns. Thediscussion ofmusic explains thepossibility ofthatloveandbeauty. There isacos- micharmony, music andlove intheuniverse. Earthly music isthe audible imitation oftheinaudible music ofthespheres. These heard harmonies have amathematical structure which isakin tothemath- ematical principles atthebase ofthewhole. Ofallthe arts,music is theonewhich most directly represents tothesenses theintelligible or- derofthings.Weforget thatcosmic music because weare"grossly closed inbyamuddy vesture ofdecay." Ourmortality leads ustobe fullofrage; earthly music ministers tothatrage,calms usandmakes us gentle. Itreminds us,inallourseparateness andopposition, ofthedom- inance ofharmony inouruniverse. Socrates' musical education ofthe warriors gives their passions thatmusic without which aman, ac- cording toLorenzo, cannot betrusted. [358 ] Interpretive Essay (392c^03c) Ifpoetry istobesalutary forthewarriors, itisnot, according toSocrates, sufficient tochange itscontent, but itsformmust alsobechanged. Heforces thepoetically inclined Adeimantus togive upthegreatest charm ofpoetry— imitation. These arehisreasons: the poetcanmakemenbelieve thattheyseeandhear hischaracters. This constitutes hisrealpower— heenchants men sothatthey livetheex- periences hewishes topresent. Thepoethides himself behind hiswork, andtheaudience forgets, forthemoment, thattheworld intowhich theyenter isnottherealone.Thespectators have thesense ofthereality ofmenandevents which aremore interesting andmore beautiful than anytheyknow intheirown lives; This iswhat makes poetry so peculiarly attractive. Thepoet's holdonmen issuch thathecancon- ceive averyhigh opinion ofhimself andagreat sense ofsuperiority over thosewhom hemoves. Buthe ismuch lesspowerful thanhe thinks he is.Precisely because hemustmake hisaudience join inthe world hewishes topresent tothem, hemust appeal toitsdominant pas- sions.Hecannot force thespectators tolisten tohimorlikeandenter intothelivesofmenwhoarerepulsive tothem.Hemust appeal toand flatter thedominant passions ofthespectators. Those passions arefear, pity,andcontempt. Thespectators want tocryortolaugh. Ifthepoet istoplease, hemust satisfy thatdemand. He iscapable ofmaking men cryorlaugh; hecanrefine theexpressions ofthepassions connected with tearsandlaughter; hecaneven, within limits, change theobjects which move those passions; buthecannot alter thefactthathethrives ontheexistence andintensification ofthose passions. But itisprecisely those passions which Socrates saysthewarriors must trytoovercome. Inthebeautiful andexalted figure ofAchilles who revolts against Aga- memnon andgrieves over the lossofhisfriends, they could find justification fortheirowntemptations and fears.Men believe that in Achilles they seethereality ofhuman perfection whereas heisonly a distillation ofthemselves. Moreover, poetry seems torequire diversity ofcharacter andac- tionandtheintensity ofpassion; unhappy, suffering men orludicrous ones are itsfavorite subjects. Virtuous mentend tobealikeandareless likely togiveway totheactions which poetry best imitates; andcer- tainly moderation isnotavirtue favored bypoets. There isacertain tendency inpoetry tomake viceandevencrime interesting because of theattractiveness ofthemen"drawn tothem. Inother words, virtue is notnecessarily thebestchoice ofsubject foramanwhowants towrite abeautiful epicordrama; thepoetmust subordinate hisloveofvirtue totherequirements ofhisart. Finally, andmost important, thepoet isunable toimitate thebest [359 ] THEREPUBLIC kind ofman, thephilosopher.
