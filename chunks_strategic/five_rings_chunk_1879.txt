"Include me, too," saidAdeimantus, "among thosewho areper- suaded." d "So it'ssurely here inmusic, asitseems," Isaid, "that theguard- iansmust build theguardhouse." "At least," hesaid, "this kind oflawlessness* easily creeps in unawares." "Yes," Isaid, "since it'sconsidered tobeakind ofplayandtodo noharm." "Itdoesn't doany, either," hesaid, "except that, establishing it- selfbitbybit, itflows gently beneath thesurface intothedispositions andpractices, andfrom there itemerges bigger inmen's contracts with oneanother; and it'sfrom thecontracts, Socrates, that itattacks laws e andregimes withmuch insolence until itfinally subverts everything private andpublic." "Well, well," Isaid. "Isthat so?" "Inmyopinion," hesaid. "Then, aswewere saying atthebeginning, mustn't ourboys take part inmore lawful play straight away, since, ifplaybecomes lawless itselfandthechildren along with it,it'snotpossible that they'll grow 425a uptobelaw-abiding, goodmen?" "Ofcourse, theymust," hesaid. "It's precisely when theboysmake afinebeginning atplayand receive lawfulness frommusic thatit—asopposed towhathappened in theformer case— accompanies them ineverything andgrows, setting right anything inthecitythatmayhave previously been neglected." "Quite true," hesaid. "Then, these men," Isaid, "will alsofindouttheseemingly small conventions thatwere alldestroyed bytheir predecessors." "What kind ofthings?" b "Such astheappropriate silence ofyounger men inthepresence ofolder ones,making way forthem and rising, care ofparents; and hair-dos, clothing, shoes, and, asawhole, thebearing ofthebody, and everything elseofthesort.Ordon'tyouthink so?" "Ido." "But tosetthemdown aslaws is,Ibelieve, foolish.^ Surely they [102 ] BookIV1424c-426a socrates/adeimantus don'tcome intobeing, norwould theybemaintained, bybeing set 425b down aslaws inspeech andinwriting." "How could they?" "Atleast it'slikely, Adeimantus," Isaid, "that thestarting point ofaman's education setsthecourse ofwhat follows too.Ordoesn't like c always callforth like?" "Ofcourse." "Then, Isuppose we'd alsosaythatthe final result issome one complete andhardy thing, whether good ortheopposite." "Ofcourse," hesaid. "That," Isaid, "iswhy Iforonewouldn't gofurther andun- dertake tosetdown lawsabout such things." "That's proper," hesaid. "And, inthename ofthegods," Isaid,"what about thatmarket business—thecontracts individuals make with oneanother inthe market, and, ifyouwish, contracts withmanual artisans, and libel, in- d suit,lodging oflegal complaints, andtheappointment ofjudges, and, ofcourse, whatever imposts might have tobecollected orassessed in themarkets orharbors, oranymarket, town, orharbor regulations, or anything elseofthekind—shallwebring ourselves tosetdown laws for anyofthese things?" "Itisn'tworth-while, "hesaid, "todictate togentlemen. Most of these things thatneed legislation they vvall,nodoubt, easily find for e themselves." "Yes,myfriend," Isaid, "provided, that is,agodgrants them the preservation ofthelawswedescribed before." "And ifnot,"hesaid, "they'll spend their lives continually setting downmany such rulesandcorrecting them, thinking they'll gethold of what's best." "Youmean," Isaid, "that suchmen will live likethosewho are sickbut,duetolicentiousness, aren't vvalling toquittheir worthless way oflife." "Most certainly." "And don't theygooncharmingly?
