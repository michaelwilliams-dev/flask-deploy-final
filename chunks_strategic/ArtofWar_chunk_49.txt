1. We can form a single united body, while the enemy must split up into fractions. Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate parts of a whole, which means that we shall be many to the enemy�s few. CHAPTER 7. WEAK POINTS AND STRONG 56 1. And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior one, our opponents will be in dire straits. 2. The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points; [Sheridan once explained the reason of General Grant�s victories by say- ing that "while his opponents were kept fully employed wondering what he was going to do, HE was thinking most of what he was going to do himself."] and his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few. 1. For should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear; should he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should he strengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his right, he will weaken his left. If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will everywhere be weak. [In Frederick the Great�s INSTRUCTIONS TO HIS GENERALS we read: "A defensive war is apt to betray us into too frequent detachment. Those generals who have had but little experience attempt to protect every point, while those who are better acquainted with their profession, having only the capital object in view, guard against a decisive blow, and acquiesce in small misfortunes to avoid greater."] 1. Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible at- tacks; numerical strength, from compelling our adversary to make these preparations against us. [The highest generalship, in Col. Henderson�s words, is "to compel the enemy to disperse his army, and then to concentrate superior force against each fraction in turn."] 1. Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle, we may concentrate from the greatest distances in order to fight. [What Sun Tzu evidently has in mind is that nice calculation of distances and that masterly employment of strategy which enable a general to di- vide his army for the purpose of a long and rapid march, and afterwards to effect a junction at precisely the right spot and the right hour in order to confront the enemy in overwhelming strength. Among many such suc- cessful junctions which military history records, one of the most dramatic and decisive was the appearance of Blucher just at the critical moment on the field of Waterloo.] 1. But if neither time nor place be known, then the left wing will be impotent to succor the right, the right equally impotent to succor the left, the van CHAPTER 7.
