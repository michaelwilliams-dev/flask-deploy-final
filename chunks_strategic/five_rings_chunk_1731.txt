LAW 44cibiacles who arrived inSpartawas not atallwhat theyexpected:He wore hishair untfimmed (asthey did), took cold baths, ate coarse bread and black broth, and wore simpleclothes. TotheSpartans thissignifiedthat he had come toseetheirwayoflife assuperiortotheAthenian; greaterthan they were, hehad chosen tobe aSpartan rather than being born one, and should thus behonored above allothers. Theyfellunder hisspelland gavehim great powers. Unfortunately Alcibiades rarelyknew how to rein inhischa.rm—he managedtoseduce theking ofSpaxtafswife and make herpregnant.When this became publicheonce more had toflee forhislife. This time Alcibiades defected toPersia, where hesuddenlywent from Spartan simplicitytoembracing thelavish Persian lifestyle down tothelast detail. Itwasofcourse immensely flatteringtothePersians tosee aGreek ofAlcibiades’ stature prefertheir culture over hisown, andtheyshowered him with honors, land, andpower. Once seduced bythemirror, theyfailed tonotice that behind thisshield Alcibiades wasplayingadoublegame,se- cretly helping theAthenians intheir warwith Spartaand thus reingrafiab inghimself with thecitytowhich hedesperatelywanted toremm, and which welcomed him back withopenarms in408 B.C. Interpretation Earlyinhispolitical career, Alcibiades made adiscoverythatchangedhis whole approach topower:Hehad acolorful and forceful personality,but when heargued hisideas stronglywith otherpeoplehewould win over a fewwhile atthe same time alienating manymore. The secret togainingas» cendancyover large numbers, he came tobelieve, was not toimposehis colors but toabsorb thecolors ofthose around him, like achameleon. Once peoplefellforthetrick, thedecepfionshewent ontopracticewould beinvisible tothem. Understand: Everyoneiswrapped upintheir own narcissistic shell. Whenyoutrytoimpose yourownegoonthem, awallgoes up,resistance isincreased. Bymirroring them, however, you seduce them into akind of narcissistic rapture: Theyaregazingatadouble oftheir own soul. This double isactuallymanufactured initsentirety byyou. Once you have used themirror toseduce them, you have great powerover them. Itisworth noting, however, thedangers inthepromiscuoususeofthe mirror. InAlcibiades’presence people feltlarger,asiftheiregoshad been doubled. But once heleft,theyfeltemptyanddiminished, and when they saw himmirroring completelydifferent peopleastotallyashehad mir- rored them, theyfeltnotjustdiminished butbetrayed.Alcibiades’ overuse oftheMirror Effect made whole peoples feelused, sothat heconstantly had tofleefrom oneplacetoanother. indeed Alcibiades soangered the Spartansthattheyfinallyhad him murdered.
