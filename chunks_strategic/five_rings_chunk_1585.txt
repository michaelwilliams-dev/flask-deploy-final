[R28-#1010 152' LAW 20Agreat deal changedinItaly during Isabella’s reign: Popescame and went, Cesare Borgiarose and then fell, Venice lost itsempire,Milan wasin vaded, Florence fellinto decline, and Rome was sacked bytheHapsburg Emperor Charles V.Through allthis, tiny Mantua notonly survived but thrived, itscourt theenvyofItaly.Itswealth andsovereigntywould remain intact for acenturyafter Isabella’s death, in1539. Interpretation Isabella d’Este understood Italy’s politicalsituation with amazing clarity: Onceyou took theside ofanyoftheforces inthefield, youwere doomed.

Isabella steered herkingdomontheonlycourse that would bring her safely through.She would notallow herself tolose herhead through loy~ altytoaduke oraking. Nor would shetrytostop theconflict thatraged around her---that would only drag herinto it.And inanycase theconflict was toheradvantage.
