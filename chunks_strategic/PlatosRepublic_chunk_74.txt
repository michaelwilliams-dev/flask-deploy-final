between the speeches and leaves the exchanges." "That I understand, too," he said. "That's the way it is with trage? dies." "Your supposition is most correct," I said. "And now I suppose I can make plain to you what I couldn't before. Of poetry and tale? telling, one kind proceeds wholly by imitation-as you say, tragedy and comedy; another, by ,.he poet's own report-this, of course, you wou]d find especially in dithyrambs; and still another by both-this is found in epic poetry and many other places too, if you understand me." "Now," he said, "I grasp what you wanted to say then." "And remember, too, that before this we asserted that what must be said had already been stated, but that how it must be said had still to be considered." "I do remember." "Now this is exactly what I meant: we must come to an agreement as to whether we'll let the poets make their narratives for us by imita? tion; or whether they are to imitate some things and not others, and what sort belongs to each group; or whether they are not to imitate at all.,, 386. C d "I divine," he said, "that you're considering whether we'll admit tragedy and comedy into the city or not." "Perhaps," I said, "and perhaps something still more than this. You see, I myself really don't know yet, but wherever the argument, like a wind, tends, thither must we go." "What Y(?U say is fine," he said. "Now, Adeimantus, reflect on whether our guardians ought to be imitators or not. Or does this follow from what went before--that each one would do a fine job in one activity, but not in many, and if he should try to put his hand to many, he would surely fail of attaining fame in all?" "Of course that's what would happen." "Doesn't the same argument also hold for imitation-the same man isn't able to imitate many things as well as one?" ''No, he isn't." "Then, he'll hardly pursue any of the noteworthy activities while at the same time imitating many things and being a skilled imitator. For even in two kinds of imitation that seem close to one another, like writing comedy and tragedy, the same meï¿½n aren't capable of producing good imitations in both at the same time. Weren't you just calling these two imitations?" "I was, and what you say is true. The same men aren't capable of doing both." "Nor are they able to be rhapsodes and actors at the same time." ''True.'' "Nor are the same actors, you know, even able to do both comic e 386. a and tragic poets. But all these are imitations, aren't they?" b "Yes, they are imitations." "Human nature, Adeimantus, looks to me to be minted in even smaller coins than this, so that it is unable either to make a fine imita? tion of many things or to do the things themselves of which the imita? tions are in fact only likenesses."
