However, you,Polemarchus, perhaps know what onearth hemeans, but Idon't understand. Forplainly he doesn't mean whatwewere justsayingâ€”giving back toanymanwhat- soever something hehasdeposited when, ofunsound mind, hedemands it.And yet,whathedeposited issurely owed tohim, isn't it?" 332a [7] POLEMARCHUS/SOCRATES THEREPUBLIC 332a "Yes." "But,when ofunsound mind hedemands it, itshould under no condition begiven back tohim?" "True," hesaid. "Then Simonides, itseems, means something different from this sortofthingwhen hesaysthat itisjusttogivebackwhat isowed." "Ofcourse it'sdifferent, byZeus," hesaid."Forhesupposes that friends owe ittofriends todosome goodandnothing bad." "Iunderstand," Isaid."Amandoes notgivewhat isowed ingiv- ingback gold tosomeone whohasdeposited it,when thegiving andthe b taking turn out tobebad, assuming thetaker andthegiver are friends. Isn't thiswhatyouassert Simonides means?" "Most certainly." "Now, what about this?Mustwegiveback toenemies whatever is owed tothem?" "That's exactly it,"hesaid, "just what's owed tothem. And I suppose thatanenemy owes hisenemy thevery thing which isalso fitting: someharm."

"Iftheanswer hastobeconsistent withwhat preceded, Socrates," hesaid, "theonethatgives benefits andharms tofriends andenemies." "Does hemean that justice isdoing good tofriends andharm toenemies?'
