passage is correctly cited in Cratylus, 397e. 20. The Greek words for "being at war" and "enemy" are polemein and polemios. 20. The word used here, which means to punish or chasten, is sophroni? zein. Literally, this is "to make moderate"; punishment in this way would be a form of education. 21. The majority of manuscripts have a reading that would mean "my (military) campaign." 22. The third wave in a series coming in to shore was traditionally sup? posed to be the big one. 23. The meeting of philosophy and political powei: is precisely coinci? dental or accidental; there is nothing in the nature of either that leads to the union; they may just happen to "fall together." There is no necessary connec? tion between a man's being born a ruler and his having philosophic talent or passion; nor is there any connection between a man's having philosophic talent and his being born in a city that would ask him to rule (the philosopher has neither the desire to be a ruler nor would he do what is necessary to im? pose his rule on unwilling people). This statement is indicative of the most fundamental difference between Plato's political teaching and that of the Enlightenment. For the moderns, knowledge necessarily leads to political power. Stated othervvise, the dissemination of knowledge gradually trans? forms civil society and insures the realization of decent regimes. Plato de? nies this contention; knowledge as knowledge does not effect desirable political -change, and knowledge disseminated is no longer knowledge. The philosopher must also be king. These are two separate functions, and this is the core of the political problem. Knowledge cannot be transformed into v,rise power except in the person of the wise man, although unwise power can be made more powerful by the use of knowledge gained from the wise. It is natural for some mento be philosopllers and for some men.to be kmgs; but it is not natural for kings to become philosopher or philos phers_'lcings. 'f:his is why Plato. cannot be characterized as an "optimist." . _ .�. � 37. A strategos, or "general" was, in the Athenian ystem, the com? mander of an army. Under him were the ten taxiarchs, one for each of the Athenian tribes; under them were the trittyarchs, of which there were three in each tribe, one for each trittys. Trittyarch is here translated as "lieutenant." 38. The greater Dionysia, the festival in honor of the god Dionysus, was held in the spring for six days, three days of which were devoted to the presen? tation of comedies and tragedies. There were celebrations in the outlying villages around Attica as welJ as in the city of Athens itself. 39. Dynamis-"power," "capacity," "faculty." Power does not have precisely the same meaning in modem usage as it did for the ancient thinkers. They taught that every power must be understood in relation to its end; a power only exists in relation to its end-it is never itself an end.
