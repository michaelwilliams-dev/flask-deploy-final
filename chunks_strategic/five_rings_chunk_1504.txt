Volmlre, 1694-1778 OBSERVANCE OFTHE LAW Forseveral centuries after thefalloftheHanDynasty {A.D. 222}, Chinese his- toryfollowed the same patternofviolent andbloody coups,one after the other. Armymen would plottokill aweakemperor,then would replacehim ontheDragon Throne with astrong general. Thegeneral would start anew dynastyand crown himself emperor;toensure hisown survival hewould kill offhisfellow generals. Afewyears later, however, thepattern would resume: New generalswould rise upand assassinate him orhis sons intheir turn. To beemperor ofChina was tobealone, surrounded byapackofenemies—it was theleastpowerful,least secure positionintherealm. InA.D. 959, General Chao K’uang—yinbecame Emperor Sung.He knew theadds, theprobabilitythat within ayearortwo hewould bemur- dered; how could hebreak thepattern? Soon after becoming emperor, Sungordered abanquettocelebrate the newdynasty,andinvited themost powerfulcommanders inthearmy.After theyhad drunk much wine, he somcrmc isrepayingorkirzrlnmzxt AFRICAN /-‘oz./4 1;:LE dismissed theguardsandeverybodyelse exceptthegenerals, who now feared hewould murder them inone fellswoop. Instead, headdressed them: “The whole dayisspentinfear, andIamunhappyboth atthetable and inmybed. Forwhich one ofyoudoes notdream ofascending the throne? Idonotdoubt your allegiance, butifbysome chance yoursubor- dinates, seeking wealth andposition,were toforce theemperor’s yellow robe upon youinturn, how couldyourefuse it?”Drunk andtearing for their lives, thegenerals proclaimedtheir innocence and their loyalty. But Sung had other ideas: “The best way topassone’s daysisinpeacefulen~ joyment ofriches and honor. Ifyouarewillingtogive upyour commands, Iamreadytoprovide you with line estates and beautiful dwellings where you maytakeyour pleasure with singersandgirlsasyour companions.” The astonished generalsrealized that instead ofalifeofanxietyand struggle Sungwasoffering them riches andsecurity. The next day, allof thegeneralstendered their resignations,andthey retired asnobles tothe estates thatSung bestowed onthem. Inone stroke, Sungturned apackof“friendly” wolves, who would likelyhave betrayed him, into agroupofdocile lambs, faxfrom allpower. Over the next few years Sung continued hiscampaigntosecure his rule. InA.D. 971,King LinoftheSouthern Han finallysurrendered tohim afteryears ofrebellion. ToLiu’s astonishment, Sung gave him arank inthe imperialcourt andinvited him tothepalacetosealtheir newfound friend- ship with wine. AsKing Liutook theglassthatSungoffered him, hehesi- tated, fearing itcontainedpoison.“Your subject’scrimes certainlymerit death,” hecried out,“but IbegYour Majestytospare your subject’slife. In- deed Idare notdrink this wine.” Emperor Sung laughed,took theglass from Lin, andswallowedithimself. There was nopoison. From then on Liubecame hismost trusted andloyal friend. Atthetime, China hadsplinteredinto manysmaller kingdoms.When Ch’ien Shu, theking ofone ofthese, was defeated, Sung’sministers ad- vised theemperortolock thisrebelup.They presenteddocuments prov- ingthat hewasstillconspiringtokillSung. When Ch’ien Shu came tovisit theemperor, however, instead oflockinghimup,Sunghonored him. He alsogave him apackage, which hetold theformer kingtoopen when he washalfwayhome. Ch’ien Shuopenedthebundle onhisreturn journey and sawthatitcontained allthepapers documentinghisconspiracy.He re- alized thatSungknew ofhismurderous plans, yethadspared him nonethe- less. This generositywon him over, and hetoobecame oneofSung’smost loyal vassals.
