I'd answer with what follows about the faith of Princes and how it should be observed. So Louis lost Lombardy by ignoring those guidelines men.tioned for those who take and want to keep new territories. This is nothing special, just ordinary and reasonable. I talked of this in Nantes with the Archbishop of Rouen when I was in France, when Valentine (as we commonly called Caesar Borgia, son of Pope Alexander) occupied Romagna. The Cardinal told me the of the Italians understood nothing war, and I responded that French understood nothing of politics � otherwise they wouldn't have let the Church become so powerful. Also it was clear that of the power both the Church and Spain had been caused by France � and France's ruin by them. One can draw a general rule THE PRINCE � 39 from this, which rarely fails � whoever helps someone else to power gets ruined. The reason is that it takes industry or force to make someone powerful, and both of these are suspect in the mind of the one who becomes powerful. REASONS WHY THE KINGDOM OF DARIUS, WHICH WAS OCCUPIED BYALEXANDER THE GREAT, DID NOT REBEL AGAINST HIS SUCCESSORS WHEN ALEXANDER DIED onsidering the difficulties of acquiring new Principalities , one can marvel at how Alexander the Great became the 'Lord of Asia in a few years , and , having acquired an Em.pire , soon after he died . It would seem logical that his Empire would revolt. As if his generals had no other difficulties than , for reasons of ambition , to bicker among themselves ! My answer is that one must remember that Principalities are governed in two different ways either by a Prince whom all serve as ministers who thanks to a concession help to govern the realm, or by a Prince and his Barons who, not by appointment, but by heredity, hold that rank. Such Barons have their own states and underlings who recognize and hold them in affection . Those states that are governed by a Prince and his servants are centralized with more authority, because nobody else in the province is viewed as more powerful or higher . When they obey someone else it is only as a minister or official and they hold no particular affection for them. The examples of these two diverse methods of government today are Turkey and France . One Lord governs the whole mon.archy of Turkey the rest are his servants . His realm is divided into provinces , or sanglaks . and he sends them administrators .changing and varying them as he wants . But the King of France is situated in the midst of a phalanx of hereditary lords , recognized and appreciated by their subjects. They all have their preemi. 42-Niccol� Machiavelli nence and the King cannot remove them without risking danger . Whoever considers these systems will see that Turkey would be difficult to acquire but, once won , easy to hold .
