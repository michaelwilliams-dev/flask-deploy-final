Wehave toseem fairand decent. Soweneed tobesubtle~—congenial yetcunning, democratic yetdevious. Thisgameofconstant duplicitymost resembles thepower dynamic that existed inthescheming world oftheoldaristocratic court. Throughout history,acourt hasalwaysformed itself around thepersoninpower—king, queen, emperor,leader. The courtiers who filled this court were inanespe- ciallydelicate position: Theyhad toserve their masters, butiftheyseemed tofawn, iftheycurried favor tooobviously,theother courtiers around them would notice and would actagainst them. Attemptstowin the mas- ter’s favor, then, had tobesubtle. And even skilled courtiers capable of such subtletystill had toprotect themselves from their fellow courtiers, who atallmoments wereschemingtopushthem aside. Meanwhile the court wassupposedtorepresenttheheight ofciviliza- tion and refinement. Violent orovertpowermoves were frownedupon; couniers would work silentlyandsecretly against any amongthem who used force. This was the couxtier’s dilemma: While appearingthevery paragon ofelegance, they had tooutwit and thwart their own opponentsin thesubtlest ofways. The successful comtier learned over time tomake all ofhis moves indirect; ifhestabbed anopponent intheback, itwaswith a velvet gloveonhishand and the sweetest ofsmiles onhisface. Instead of usingcoercion oroutright treachery,theperfectcourtier gothisway through seduction, charm, deception,and subtle strategy, always planning several moves ahead. Life inthe court was anever-ending gamethat re- quired constant vigilanceand tactical thinking.Itwas civilized war. Todayweface apeculiarlysimilar paradox tothat ofthe courtier: Everythingmustappear civilized, decent, democratic, and fair. Butifwe playbythose rules toostrictly,ifwetake them tooliterally,we arecrushed bythose around uswho arenot sofoolish.
