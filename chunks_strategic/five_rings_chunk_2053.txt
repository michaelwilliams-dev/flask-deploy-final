Thisname forNemesis probably stems from Adrastus, ancient kingof Argos, whoestablished analtar toher.Aeschylus isthe firstauthor intheex- tantGreek literature tomention Adrasteia ('The wise prostrate themselves before Adrasteia," Frometheus, 36).Thename ofthegoddess, thepoet brought tomind here,andthiscontext (which isanimplicit attack onallexist- ingcitiesandtheirmost sacred laws) calltomind Adrastus, wholedtheattack oftheSeven Against Thebes.

[A gymnasium can alsomean a"school," aplace where thesoul istrained (Gorgias, 493d). The stripping ofsouls isalso aPlatonic metaphor {ibid., 523e). Thesignificance ofthispassage canbegrasped better withanaware- nessofthese facts.] Thedifference between Greek andbarbarian isepitomized bythecapacity tobare thebody, theovercoming ofshame without becoming shameless (cf.Herodotus, I,10andThucydides, I,6).Seeing anakedwoman wasthesource ofaregicide andatyranny among thebarbarians, according to Herodotus' account oftheGyges story (I,8).Virtue andclothing seem togo together indemotic morality (457a), andtheradical change thatculminates in theruleofphilosophic frankness isforeshadowed here. 12.Herodotus, I,23-24. 13.Cf400c, note 50. 14."Eristic" means "contentiousness," argument carried onforthesake ofwinning; formally itlooks like"dialectic," which isfriendly conversation; but eristic isnotcarried onforthesakeoftruth. This isthe firstuseoftheword "dialectic" intheRepublic andprovides afirstcommon-sense view ofitsmean- ing. InLetter VII(342a ff.)Plato describes therequisites fortheattainment ofknowledge ofathing. There arethree; name (forexample, circle); defini- tion (forexample, "that inaplane which iseverywhere equidistant from the extremities tothecenter"); representation orimage (forexample, thecircle [458 ] i-ium^Iuuurk V drawn bythegeometer, which isonlyanimperfect example andanaidto learning, notthereal circle). The eristic disputant misleads hisinterlocutor^ bylooking only tothenames manandwoman, nottotheir definitions. 15.This isaplayonalinefrom apoem ofPindar ofwhichwepossess only afragment [Bowra, PiWan Can7i/jja, fr,194(Oxford: 1951)]. "The line issimply: "heplucks anunripe fruitofwisdom." Pindar wasapparently ridiculing philosophers andthestudy ofnature. This ispartof"theoldquar- relbetween philosophy andpoetry" (607b). Socrates isturning Pindar's ridi- cule, notonlyoncomedy, butonPindar himself andpoetry asawhole, to theextent thatpoetry ishostile tophilosophy. Even thetragedian would have toregard Socrates asacomic figure—someone nottobetaken seriously, if tragedy istobetaken seriously. (Inthissense, Aristophanes' Clouds isaplay intheservice ofallpoetry— tragedy aswellascomedy.) Thenakedness ofwom- enfollows from philosophic investigation; and thisshamelessness isacrucial step inthepreparation oftheruleofphilosophers andphilosophy (aruleover poetry inparticular). Socrates takes alinefrom thepoetic attack onphiloso- phyanduses itaspartofthephilosophic attack onpoetry. Hesayspoetry grounds itsappeal ontheprejudices ofconventional morality. Socrates usestheemphatically masculine aner (cf.329c, note 14)at thebeginning ofthesentence. Itisthemalewholaughs atwomanliness; Soc- ratesdefends thehuman being. Poetry istacidy identified withmanliness and hence with thecityandthepolitical. The limitations ofmanliness begin to emerge inthispassage. Themale, thewarrior whodefends thecity, isnotopen tophilosophy and isonlyincompletely human. 16.Theword translated as"wave" alsomeans "foetus." [Cf, Theaetetus, 149 flf.and210b, where words related tothisone (inthelatter sense) abound.
