darkness and when they have been transferred from darkness to light. And if he held that these same things happen to a soul too, whenever he saw one that is confused and unable to make anything out, he wouldn't laugh without reasoning but would go on to consider whether, come from a brighter life, it is in darkness for want of being accustomed, or whether, going from greater lack of learning to greater brightness, it is dazzled by the greater brilliance. And then he would deem the first soul happy � for its condition and its life, while he would pity the second. And, if he wanted to laugh at the second soul, his laughing in this case would be less a laugh of scorn than would his laughing at the soul which � has come from above out of the light." "What you say is quite sensible," he said. "Then, if this is true," I said, "we must hold the following about . these things: education is not what the professions of certain men assert . it to be. They presumably assert that they put into the soul knowledge that isn't in it, as though they were putting sight into blind eyes." "Yes," he said, "they do indeed assert that.'' "But the present argument, on the other hand," I said, "indicates that this power is in the soul of each,3 and that the instrument with which each learns-just as an eye is not able to tum toward the light from the dark without the whole body-must be turned around from ': that which is coming into being together with the whole soul until it is , able to endure looking at that which is and the brightest part of that :" which is. And we affirm that this is the good, don't we?" "Yes.'" : "There would, therefore," I said, "be an art of this turning 'f around, concerned with the way in which this power can most easily f lllld efficiently be turned around, not an art of producing sight in it. i'.Rather, this art takes as given that sight is there, but not rightly turned i. nor looking at what it ought to look at, and accomplishes this object." "So it seems," he said. ,; "Therefore, the other virtues of a soul, as they are called, are prob- ably somewhat close to those of the body. For they are really not there t:-beforehand and are later produced by habits and exercises, while the fi virtue of exercising prudence is more than anything somehow more di? !:vine, it seems; it never loses its power, but according to the way it is }(turned, it becomes useful and helpful or, again, useless and harmful. Or it haven't you yet reflected about the men who are said to be vicious but lfwise, how shrewdly their petty soul sees and how sharply it dis? f�tinguishes those things toward which it is turned, showing that it i{doesn't have poor vision although it is
