sum up the worst man. He is awake, presumably, what we described a dreaming man to be." "Most certainly." "And he comes from a man who is by nature most tyrannic and gets a monarchy; and the longer he lives in tyranny, the more he be? comes like that." "Necessarily," Glaucon said, as he took over the argument. "The man who turns out to be worst," I said, "will he also turn out to be most wretched? And he who is for the longest time the most a tyrant, will he also have been most wretched for the longest time--in the light of the truth? However, the many have many opinions." "But, regardless," he said, "this is necessarily so." "With respect to likeness," I said, "does the tyrannic man corre? spond to anything other than the city under a tyranny, and the man of the people to anything other than the city under a democracy, and simi? larly with the other men?" "Of course not." "And as city is to city with respect to virtue and happiness so is man to man?. " "Of course." "With respect to virtue, what is the relation between a city under a tyranny and the one under a kingship such as we first described?" "Everything is the opposite," he said. "The one was the best, the other the worst." "I won't ask you which you mean," I said. "It's plain. But as to their happiness and wretchedness, do you judge similarly or dif? ferently? And let's not be ovetwhelmed at the sight of the tyrant-one man--0r a certain few around him; but, as one must, let's go in and view the city as a whole, and, creeping down into every comer and looking, only then declare our opinion." "What you suggest is right," he said. "And it's plain to everyone that there is no city more wretched than one under a tyranny and none happier than one under a kingship." ï¿½ "And abopt these same things, as they exist in the men," I said, "would I also be right in suggesting that that man should be deemed fit to judge them who is able with his thought to creep into a man's disposi? tion and see through it-a man who is not like a child looking from out? side and ovetwhelmed by the tyrannic pomp set up as a facade for those outside, but who rather sees through it adequately? And what if I were to suppose that all of us must hear that man who is both able to judge and has lived together with the tyrant in the same place and was witness to his actions at home and saw how he is with each of his own, among whom he could most be seen stripped of the tragic gear; and, again, has seen him in public dangers; and, since he has seen all that, we were to bid him to report how the tyrant stands in relation to the others in
