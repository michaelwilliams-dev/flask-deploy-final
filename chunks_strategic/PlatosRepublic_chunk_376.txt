moral indigna? tion, for he knows what to expect of men. Political idealism is the most destructive of human passions. All of Western man's aspirations to justice and the good life are given expression and fulfillment in Socrates' proposals for a city. This is a regime where men's faculties are not denied their exercise by poverty, birth, or sex, where the accidental attachments of family and city do not limit a man's understanding and pursuit of the good; it is a regime, finally, where wise, public-spirited men rule for the common good. But this regime can only be achieved at the sacrifice of other treasured things to which we are less reasonably, but perhaps more powerfully, inclined. These are property, family, and the city of one's birth-all the things a man can love as his own; they exist everywhere and existed long before the emergence of philosophy. Not only do these things constitute the charm of life for most men, they also provide the occasion for the acquisition and the exercise of most of the virtues which can give ordinary men dignity. If reason requires Socrates' city, love of family and friends, patriotism, and even heroism demand the old? er kind of city. Man's dual nature makes it impossible to solve the problem posed by the two kinds of goods. Every decent regime is some kind of uneasy compromise between them. Socrates' scheme, in a spirit of comedy, proposes the triumph of the side which represents the soul, the side to which the best kind of man can be almost totally de oted, the only rational side. The non-barbaric society is defined by openness to this part of man's longing; this openness to philosophy is the very definition of civilization and carries with it a tendency to wish for the actualization of the regime of the philosopher-kings. It is the light in the cave which Socratesï¿½and those near him fought to preserve when its infancy was so severely threatened. But to forget the other side of man-to neglect the irony of Socrates' proposals-is also a fatal error. The cosmopolitan communistic society of egalitarian man is a distor? tion of man and the city which is more terrible than barbarism. In act? ing as though the eternal tension between body and soul has been over? come by history, a society is constituted which satisfies neither body nor soul. Such a society creates one universal cave iHuminated by an ar? tificial light, for men have not made the sacrifices necessary to the at? tairiment of true cosmopolitanism but have been robbed of those at? tachments which can give them depth. The thinkers of the Enlighten? ment, culminating in Marx, preserved Socrates' ultimate goals but forgot his insistence that nature made them impossible for men at large. Only by distorting or narrowing man's horizon can the permanent duality in his nature be overcome. The Republic finally teaches that justice as total dedication to the city cannot be simply good for the philosopher, and
