changed to the life of an eagle. Atalanta's soul had drawn one of the middle lots; she saw the great honors of an athletic man and couldn't pass them by but took them. After this soul he saw that of Epeius, son of Panopeus, going into the nature of an artisan woman. And far out among the last he saw the soul of the buffoon Thersites, clothing itself as an ape.17 And by 620 c chance Odysseus' soul had drawn the last lot of all and went to choose; from memory of its former labors it had recovered from love of honor; it went around for a long time looking for the life of a private man who minds his own business; and with effort it found one lying somewhere, neglected by the others.

Now it was a necessity for all to drink a certain measure of the water, but those who were not saved by prudence drank more than the measure. As he drank, each forgot everything. And when they had gone to sleep and it was midnight, b there came thunder and an earthquake; and they were suddenly carried from there, each in a different way, up to their birth, shooting like stars.20 But he himself was prevented from drinking the water. However, in what way and how he came into his body, he did not know; but, all of a udden, he recovered his sight and saw that it was morning and he was lying on the pyre.
