of honor is in the pleasure that comes from thinking?" "No," he said. "Honor accompanies them all, if each achieves its aim. For the wealthy man is honored by many; and so are the courageous man and the wise one. Therefore, all have experience of the kind of pleasure that comes from being honored. But the kind of pleasure connected with the vision of what is cannot be tasted by anyone except the lover of wisdom." SOCRATES/GLAUCON "II T H E R E P u B L c1 582d e 583 a b "Therefore," I said, "as for experience, he is the finest judgeï¿½ among the three men." "By far." "And, moreover, only he will have gained his experience in the company of prudence." "Of course." "Furthermore, as to the instrument by means of which judgment must be made, it is not the instrument of the lover of gain or the lover of honor but that of the lover of wisdom." "What's that?"
