well." "That's very true," he said. "Have you," I said, ''any other life that despises political offices other than that of true philosophy?" "No, by Zeus," he said. "I don't." "But men who aren't lovers of ruling must go5 to it; otherwise. rival lovers will fight." "Of course." 520b C d e 521 a b [ 199] 517. b C d e 517. a b "Who else will you compel to go to the guarding of the city than the men who are most prudent in those things through which a city is best governed, and who have other honors and a better life than the political life?" "No one else," he said. "Do you want us now to consider in what way such men will come into being and how one will lead them up to the light, just as some men are said to have gone from Hades up to the gods?"6 "How could I not want to?" he said. "Then, as it seems, this wouldn,t be the twirling of a shell7 but the turning of a soul around from a day that is like night to the true day; it is that ascent to what is which we shall truly affirm to be philosophy." "Most certainly." "Then mustn,t we consider what studies have such a power?" "Of course." "What then, Glaucon, would be a study to draw the soul from be? coming to being? And, as I speak, I think of this. Weren,t we saying that ifs necessary for these men to be champions in war when they are young?"8 "Yes, we were saying that." "Then the study we are seeking must have this further charac- teristic in addition to the former one." "What?" "It mustn,t be useless to warlike men." "Of course, it mustn,t,ï¿½ he said, "if that can be." "Now previously they were educated by us in gymnastic and musi.c." "That was so," he said. "And gymnastic, of course, is wholly engaged with coming into being and passing away. For it oversees growth and decay in the body." "It looked that way." "So it wouldn,t be the study we are seeking." "No, it wouldn,t." "And is music, so far as we described it before?" "But it," he said, "was the antistrophe9 to gymnastic, if you re? member. It edu,cated the guardians through habits, transmitting by har? mony a certain harmoniousness, not knowledge, and by rhythm a cer? tain rhythmicalness. And connected with it were certain other habits, akin to these, conveyed by speeches, whether they were tales or speeches of a truer sort. But as for a study directed to\vard something of the sort you are now seeking, there was nothing of the kind in it." "Your reminder to me is quite precise," I said. "For, really, it had nothing of the sort. But Glaucon, you demonic man, what could there be that is like this? For all the arts surely seemed to be me? chanical." '.' "Certainly they were.
