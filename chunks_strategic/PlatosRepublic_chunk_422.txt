If he is referring to comic poets, they could not mind their own business while being serious. 6. A gymnasium is literally a place where one goes naked or strips; "gymnastic" is ..the exercise of the naked body," and is specifically Greek. [A gymnasium can also mean a "school," a place where the soul is trained (Gorgias, 493d). The stripping of souls is also a Platonic metaphor (ibid., 523e). The significance of this passage can be grasped better with an aware? ness of these facts.] The difference between Greek and barbarian is epitomized by the capacity to bare the body, the overcoming of shame without becoming shameless (cf. Herodotus, I, 10 and Thucydides, I, 6). Seeing a naked woman was the source of a regicide and a tyranny among the barbarians, according to Herodotus' account of the Gyges story (I, 8). Virtue and clothing seem to go together in demotic morality (457a), and the radical change that culminates in the rule of philosophic frankness is foreshadowed here. 1. Herodotus, I, 23-24. 2. Cf. 400c, note 50. 3. "Eristic" means "contentiousness," argument carried on for the sake of winning; formally it looks like "dialectic," which is friendly conversation; but eristic is not carried on for the sake of truth. This is the first use of the word "dialectic" in the Republic and provides a first common-sense view of its mean? ing. In Letter VII (342a ff.) Plato describes the requisites for the attainment of knowledge of a thing. There are three; name (for example, circle); defini? tion (for example, "that in a plane which is everywhere equidistant from the extremities to the center"); representation or image (for example, the circle drawn by the geometer, which is only an imperfect exampie : _;fuj1'iid.'td learning, not the real circle). The eristic disputant misleads his bit H�rciitt>ii by looking only to the names man and woman, not to their definitions;""-,, 1. This is a play on a line from a poem of Pindar of which We�poss only a fragment [Bowra, Pindari Carmina, fr. 194 (Oxford: 1951)]>The line is simJ?ly: ..he plucks an unripe fruit of wisdom." Pindar was apparently ridiculing philosophers and the study of nature. This is part of "the old quar? rel between philosophy and poetry" (607b). Socrates is turning Pindar's ridi? cule, not only on comedy, but on Pindar himself and poetry as a whole, to the extent that poetry is hostile to philosophy. Even the tragedian would have to regard Socrates as a comic figure-someone not to be taken seriously, if tragedy is to be taken seriously. (In this sense, Aristophanes' Clouds is a play in the service of all poetry-tragedy aswell as comedy.) The nakedness of wom? en follows from philosophic investigation; and this shamelessness is a crucial step in the preparation of the rule of philosophers and philosophy (a rule
