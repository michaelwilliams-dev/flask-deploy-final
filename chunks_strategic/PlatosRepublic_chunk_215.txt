they receive an embassy of speeches of older19 private men, but doing battle they hold sway themselves; and naming shame simplicity, .��they push it out with dishonor, a fugitive; calling moderation ' cowardliness and spattering it with mud, they banish it;20 persuading that measure and orderly expenditure are rustic and illiberal, they join with many useless desires in driving them over the frontier." "Indeed they do." "Now, once they have emptied and purged these from the soul of the man whom they are seizing and initiating in great rites, they pro? ceed to return insolence, anarchy, wastefulness, and shamelessness from exile, in a blaze of light, crowned and accompanied by a numerous chorus, extolling and flattering them by calling insolence good education;21 anarchy, freedom; wastefulness, magnificence; and shamelessness, courage. Isn't it in some such way," I said, "that a man, when he is young, changes from his rearing in necessary desires to the liberation and unleashing of unnecessary and useless pleasures?" "Yes," he said, "it's quite manifestly that way." "Then, I suppose that afterward such a man lives spending no more money, effort, and time on the necessary than on the unnecessary pleasures. However, if he has good luck and his frenzy does not go beyond bounds-and if; also, as a result of getting somewhat older and the great disturbances having passed by, he readmits a part of the exiles and doesn't give himself wholly over to the invaders-then he lives his life in accord with a certain equality of pleasures he has established.

Rather, he shakes his head at all this and says that all are alike and must be honored on an equal basis." "That's exactly," he said, "what a man in this condition does." "Then," I said, "he also lives along day by day, gratifying the desire that occurs to him, at one time drinking and listening to the 560 C d e 561 a b C 561 C d e 562 a b flute, at another downing water and reducing; now practicing gym_ nastic, and again idling and neglecting everything; and sometimes spending his time as though he were occupied with philosophy. Often he engages in politics and, jumping up, says and does whatever chances to come to him; and if he ever admires any soldiers, he turns in that direction; and if it's money-makers, in that one. And there is neither order nor necessity in his life, but calling this life sweet, free,
