troops are prostrated with thirst, we can dictate our own terms without moving. Or if you think that the pass I mention is too far off, we could make a stand against him at the I-wu pass, which is nearer. The cunning and resource of Tzu-fang himself would be expended in vain against the enormous strength of these two positions." Liang Hsi, refusing to act on this advice, was overwhelmed and swept away by the invader.] 5. Ground on which each side has liberty of movement is open ground. [There are various interpretations of the Chinese adjective for this type of ground. Ts�ao Kung says it means "ground covered with a network of roads," like a chessboard. Ho Shih suggested: "ground on which inter- communication is easy."] 6. Ground which forms the key to three contiguous states, [Ts�au Kung defines this as: "Our country adjoining the enemy�s and a third country conterminous with both." Meng Shih instances the small principality of Cheng, which was bounded on the north-east by Ch�i, on the west by Chin, and on the south by Ch�u.] so that he who occupies it first has most of the Empire at his command, [The belligerent who holds this dominating position can constrain most of them to become his allies.] is a ground of intersecting highways. CHAPTER 12. THE NINE SITUATIONS 95 7. When an army has penetrated into the heart of a hostile country, leaving a number of fortified cities in its rear, it is serious ground. [Wang Hsi explains the name by saying that "when an army has reached such a point, its situation is serious."] 8. Mountain forests, [Or simply "forests."] rugged steeps, marshes and fens�all country that is hard to traverse: this is difficult ground. 9. Ground which is reached through narrow gorges, and from which we can only retire by tortuous paths, so that a small number of the enemy would suffice to crush a large body of our men: this is hemmed in ground. 10. Ground on which we can only be saved from destruction by fighting without delay, is desperate ground. [The situation, as pictured by Ts�ao Kung, is very similar to the "hemmed- in ground" except that here escape is no longer possible: "A lofty mountain in front, a large river behind, advance impossible, retreat blocked." Ch�en Hao says: "to be on �desperate ground� is like sitting in a leaking boat or crouching in a burning house." Tu Mu quotes from Li Ching a vivid description of the plight of an army thus entrapped: "Suppose an army invading hostile territory without the aid of local guides: � it falls into a fatal snare and is at the enemy�s mercy. A ravine on the left, a mountain on the right, a pathway so perilous that the horses have to be roped together and the chariots carried in slings, no passage open in front, retreat cut off behind, no choice but to proceed in single file. Then, before there is time to
