is there an identity of the concern for the proper practice of the art and that for one's own advantage. Soc? rates embodies a solution to the conflicting demands which render Thrasymachus' life meaningless: Socrates combines in a single way of life the satisfactions of the lover of knowledge and the lover of gain. All other lives are essentially self-contradictory. In the philosopher we can find both the public-spirited ruler and the satisfied man. Thus Socrates, whose explicit intention was to show that the prac? titioners of arts-and hence Thrasymachus' rulers-cannot be con? cerned with their own advantage, has, by the introduction of the wage? earner's ait, tacitly admitted the necessity and legitimacy of that con? cern. He has only shown that men cannot consistently at the same time be both rulers in the precise sense defined by Thrasymachus and seekers of their own advantage, while hinting that philosophy is the only resolution of the conflict between art or science and self-interest. As it appears to Thrasymachus, Socrates is madly insisting that a man spend his life in total dedication to others without any reason for so doing and in blind indifference to the facts oflife. Thrasymachus cannot defend his position because of his earlier assertions, and he is prevented by them from making his powerful appeal to men's lust and their re? spect for knowledge. His definition of justice as the advantage of the stronger fails, but only because his definition of the ruler is indefensible. He sees this as a result of having become entangled in Socrates' dishon? est arguments. And no reader can be satisfied that Thrasymachus' defini? tion has been refuted or that this discussion has proved that there is sufficient reason to devote oneself to the common good. The discussion has only served to heighten the sense of the disproportion between the private and the public good, to make justice more problematic than ever. Instead of abandoning or attempting to improve Thrasymachus' definition of justice, the conversation curious4'. changes its theme. �without having established what justice fs':�Socr;;;-,turns to the ques? tion of whether it is good or not. l.! is most unusual to attempt to deter? !!)ine the desirability of a thing whose character one does not k . Soc? rates' reason for this procedure is that this is what interests the other men present whose attention he is hying to attract and who believe they have a fair sense of what justice is. They are not particularly in? terested in a philosophic investigation of the nature of justice, but in how they will live profitably or well. Thrasymachus has told them that they will do so by becoming tyrants, by disregarding the laws. Socrates appears to disagree. They want to know whether Thrasymachus' ruler lives a good life. Thrasymachus �has stated that it is bad to be just, in the sense of caring for others, or obeying the law, or being dedicated to the common good. Socrates until now, along with Cephalus and Polemarchus,
