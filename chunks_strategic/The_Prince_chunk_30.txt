war. I believe this is because of the good and bad use of cruelty. Cruelty well used (if one can ever say cruelty is good) is when it is practiced suddenly and de.cisively, but not prolonged. The practicant converts to practices more useful for his subjects. Cruelty badly used is when although slight at the beginning, it grows more widely used in time. Those who work the first way can rectify their state with God and with men, as Agatocle did. Those who practice the second way fail. Note that in taking a state the occupier has to act quickly and commit the worst offenses right away, so that he doesn't have to go on offending everyday. This way, giving no more offense, he can reassure and benefit others. Who doesn't do this, either out of 62 � Niccol� Machiavelli timidity or bad advice, always has to have the dagger in hand.

From these two instincts are born three outcomes; either a Principality, or liberty, or unbridled license. A Principality arises when either the people or the prominent citizens see an opportunity dominate: the prominent leaders, to scared of the populace, back the reputations of one of their own so that they can work their purposes under his shadow. Or the populace, scared of the prominent citizens, sees an opportunity to raise one of their own who will defend their interests. One who assumes leadership with the help of the prominent citizens or oli.garchy has more trouble maintaining his position than one raised by the populace. A Prince raised by other prominent leaders finds himself constrained because the others surrounding him are his equals and will not be commanded by him or easily managed. One who is raised by the populace finds himself alone sur.rounded mostly by people ready to obey. It is hard,
