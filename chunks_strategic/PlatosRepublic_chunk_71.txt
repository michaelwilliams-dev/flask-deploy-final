"And, for Homer's sake," I said, "I hesitate to say that it's not holy to say these things against Achilles and to believe them when said by others; or, again, to believe that he said to Apollo, You've hindered me, Far-Darter, most destructive of all gods. And I would revenge myself on you, if I had the power;33 and that he was disobedient to the river, who was a god, and ready to do battle with it;34 and that he said about the locks consecrated to another river, Spercheius, To the hero Patroclus I would give my hair To take with him,35 although he was a corpse.
