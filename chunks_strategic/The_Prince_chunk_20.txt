Vice -versa, France would be easy to occupy but difficult to hold . The reasons it is difficult to occupy Turkey are that not being called in by the Princes of the realm one cannot hope for a rebel.lion from those around the Sultan to aid the enterprise . This is be.cause of what was said above the subalterns are all tied and obligated to the Sultan and are more difficult to corrupt . Even if they are corruptible , they are of little use because they can't hold the people behind them for the same reason. Whoever attacks Turkey must expect to meet a united front. He has to rely on his own powers and not the disorder of his foe . But once having broken the enemy in the field , so that no more armies can be formed , the attacker has nothing to worry about except the bloodline of the Prince . Once that is extin. guished, there is no one else to fear � no one else holds the es.teem of the populace . Just as he had nothing to hope of the minis.ters before victory, he has nothing to fear from them afterwards . The opposite is true of countries that are ruled like France . It is easy to insinuate oneself into the realm by gaining the alle.giance of a Baron . One always finds malcontents and those who want reform . These interests can help one gain access and ease the victory. But afterwards it is infinitely difficult to control them both those who have helped and those who were opposed . It is not enough to extinguish the bloodline of the King because other lords remain who head new Not being able to up groups . satisfy or extinguish them, a new Prince loses that state as soon as the situation changes . Now consider what kind of government prevailed in the realm of Darius -it was similar to Turkey. For Alexander it was need. ful to risk all and first win the field . After the victory, with Darius dead, Alexander reigned supreme because of the reasons men. tioned above . Even his successors, by remaining united, could rule easily no other uprisings occurred except those they themselves caused. THE PRINCE �-43 But in states ruled like France , it is impossible to keep them orderly. This explains the frequent rebellions in Spain , France and in Greece under the Romans, because of the many Princes in these countries . As long as they were there , the Romans could not be sure of possession . Once forgotten , the power and longevity of the empire made them secure rulers . Even warring among them. selves they could divide provinces according to who established rule there . Once the bloodline of the native lords was spent peo. ple recognized only the Romans . Considering these things it is not so hard to see how Alexander took Asia , while others
