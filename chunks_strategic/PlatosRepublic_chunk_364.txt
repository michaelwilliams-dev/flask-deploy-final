a ship which belongs to the people, who are compared to a big and strong shipowner who is al? so somewhat deaf, short of vision, and ignorant of navigation. In? capable of running the ship himself, the owner turns it over to sailors who are more preoccupied with securing the positions of power than they are with the art of sailing. They should be subordinate to a pilot, but the mechanics of the struggle for power become an art that is treated as an end in itself. The true pilot is not interested in fighting for his proper position and is excluded. In this image, the sailors are akin to the warrior class without rulers; the chiefs of that class remain preoc? cupied with the human world, unaware that a good sailing requires knowledge of mathematics and astronomy, that is, of the cosmos as a whole. This knowledge appears irrelevant to their concerns, and the true pilot is ridiculed. The philosopher, who, contrary to the indica? tions of the Apology, must know nature, and particularly the nature of the heavens, is as necessary to the city as a pilot is to a ship. He is merely misunderstood, and the people are misled. His knowledge is not described here as something desirable in itself for him, but it is ac? quired for the sake of the city; it is like the pilof s or the doctor's art. He is ready and fit to serve if only the ship's owner can perceive how necessary he is. The philosopher's situation might well be compared to that of Gulliver in Lilliput. He is too big and too different to be trusted, too much beyond the temptations of the small ambitious men to be their tool; but if the Lilliputians could have maintained their faith in him, they would have both profited and become more just. This ex? planation of the philosopher's lack of reputation also serves as a de? fense against the accusation that he pries into the secrets of the heavens and Hades, not by denying that he does but by insisting on the value to the city of his doing so. After having by means of the image disposed of the objection that the philosopher is useless to the city, Socrates turns to the explanation of why gifted young men tum away from philosophy. According to Soc? rates, their talents make them able to succeed at anything; healthy young people usually try to excel at what is most respectable within their community. The honors given by the city attract the potential philosophers to political life. Because these young men seem ï¿½to have great political futures, corrupt and ambitious statesmen hope to make use of them, promising them aII sorts of advantages if they are willing to adopt the current practices of the city. It is not, as is often said, the sophists who corrupt the young. The sophists, Socrates says, are-harm? less men who are only servants of the city's passions. The
