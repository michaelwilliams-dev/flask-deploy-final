production of the crop from the earth; for that, rather, it is called skilled in fa1ming." "That's my opinion." "What about this?" I said. "Is there in the city we just founded a kind of knowledge belonging to some of the citizens that counsels not b. about the affairs connected with some particular thing in the city, but about how the city as a whole would best deal with itself and the other cities?" "There is indeed." "What and in whom is it?" I said. "It's the guardian's skill," he said, "and it's in those rulers whom we just now named perfect guardians." "Thanks to this knowledge, what Jo you call the city?" "Of good counsel," he said, "and really wise." "Then, do you suppose," I said, "that there will be more smiths in b. our city than these true guardians?" "Far more smiths," he said. "Amongï¿½those," I said, "who receive a special name for possess? ing some kind of knowledge, wouldn't the guardians be the fewest of al1 in number?" "By far." "It is, therefore, from the smal1est group and part of itself and the knowledge in it, from the supervising13 and ruling part, that a city founded according to nature would be wise as a whole. And this class, which properly has a share in that knowledge which alone among the various kinds of knowledge ought to be cal1ed wisdom, has, as it seems, the fewest members by nature." "What you say," he said, "is very true." "So we've found-I don't know how-this one of the four, both it and where its seat in the city is." "In my opinion, at least," he said, "it has been satisfactorily discovered." "And, next, courage, both itself as wel1 as where it's situated in the city-that courage thanks to which the city must be ca1led courageous-isn't very hard to see." "How's that?" "Who," I said, "would say a city is cowardly or courageous while looking to any part other than the one that defends it and takes the field on its behalf?" "There's no one," he said, "who would look to anything else." "I don't suppose," I said, "that whether the other men in it are cowardly or courageous would be decisive for its being this or that." "No, it wouldn't." "So a city is also courageous by a part of itself, thanks to that part's having in it a power that through everything will preserve the opinion about which things are terrible-that they are the same ones and of the same sort as those the lawgiver transmitted in the education. Or don't you call that courage?" "I didn't quite understand what you said," he said. "Say it again." "I mean," I said, "that courage is a certain kind of preserving." "Just what sort of preserving?" "The preserving of the opinion produced by law through educa? tion about what-and what sort of thing-is terrible. And by preserv? ing through everything I meant preserving that opinion and not casting it out in
