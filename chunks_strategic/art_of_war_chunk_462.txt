[Chang Yu says: "In apportioning the defenses for a cantonment, light horse will be sent out to survey the position and ascertain the weak and strong points all along its circumference. Hence the small quantity of dust and its motion."] 24. Humble words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is about to advance. ["As though they stood in great fear of us," says Tu Mu. "Their object is to make us contemptuous and careless, after which they will attack us." Chang Yu alludes to the story of T�ien Tan of the Ch�i-mo against the Yen forces, led by Ch�i Chieh.
