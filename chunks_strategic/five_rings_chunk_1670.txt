Patiently waiting forhischance, hekepthisoptions open.And when the French Revolution broke out, in1789, Fouché waited nolonger: Hegotrid ofhiscassock, grew hishairlong,and became arevolutionary.Forthis was thespiritofthe times. Tomiss theboat atthis critical moment could have speltdisaster. Fouché did not miss theboat: Befriendingtherevolutionary leader Robespierre,hequicklyrose intherebel ranks. In1792 thetown of Nantes elected Fouché tobeitsrepresentativetotheNational Convention (created thatyeartoframe anew constitution for aFrench republic). When Fouché arrived inParis totake hisseat attheconvention, avio- lent rifthad broken outbetween themoderates and theradical Jacobins. Fouché sensed that inthelongrunneither side wouldemerge victorious. Power rarely endsupinthehands ofthose who start arevolution, oreven ofthose who further it;powersticks tothose who bring ittoaconclusion. That was theside Fouché wanted tobeon. His sense oftimingwasuncanny.Hestarted asamoderate, formoderv ates were inthemajority. When thetime came todecide onwhether ornot toexecute Louis XVI, however, hesaw that thepeoplewere clamoringfor theking’s head, sohecast thedeciding vote~—for theguillotine. Now he had become aradical. Yet astensions came totheboil inParis, heforesaw thedanger ofbeingtooclosely associated withanyonefaction,sohe ac- ceptedapositionintheprovinces, where hecould lielow for awhile. A fewmonths later hewasassignedtothepostofproconsulinLyons,where heoversaw theexecution ofdozens ofaristocrats. At acertain moment, however, hecalled ahalt tothekillings, sensing that themood ofthe coun- nywasturning—and despitetheblood alreadyonhishands, thecitizens of Lyons hailed him asasavior from what had become known astheTerror. SofarFouché hadplayedhiscards brilliantly,but in1794 hisold friend Robespierrerecalled him toParis toaccount forhisactions inLyons. Robespierrehad been thedriving force behind the Terror. Hehad sent heads onboth therightand theleftrolling, and Fouché, whom he no longer trusted, seemed destined toprovidethe next head. Over the next few weeks, atense struggleensued: WhileRobespierrerailed openly against Fouché, accusing ofhimdangerousambitions andcallingforhis ar» rest, thecraftyFouché worked more indirectly, quietly gaining support among those who were beginningtotireofRobespierre’sdictatorial con- trol. Fouché wasplayingfortime. Heknew that thelongerhesurvived, the more disaffected citizens hecould rally against Robespierre.Hehad to have broad supportbefore hemoved againstthepowerful leader. Heral- lied support amongboth themoderates and thejacobins, playingonthe widespreadfear ofRobespierre-—everyonewas afraid ofbeing the next to gototheguillotine.
