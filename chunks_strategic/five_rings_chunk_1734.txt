Observance V Dr.Milton H.Erickson, apioneerinstrategic psychotherapy,would often educate hispatients powerfullybutindirectly bycreatingakind ofmirror effect. Constructingananalogytomake patientsseethetruth ontheir own, hewould bypasstheir resistance tochange.When Dr.Erickson treated married couples complainingofsexual problems,forinstance, heoften found thatpsychotherapy’stradition ofdirect confrontation andproblem- airing only heightenedthespouses’ resistance andsharpenedtheir differ- ences. Instead, hewould draw ahusband and wife out onother topics, often banal ones, tryingtofind ananalogyforthesexual conflict. In one couple’sfirst session, thepairwere discussingtheir eating habits, especiallyatdinner. The wife preferredtheleisurely approach——a drink before themeal, some appetizers,and then asmall main course, allat aslow, civilized pace. This frustrated thehusband-—he wanted togetdin- ner over quicklyand todigrightinto themain course, thebiggerthebetter. Astheconversation continued, thecouple begantocatch glimpsesofan analogytotheirproblemsinbed. The moment theymade thisconnection, however, Dr.Erickson would changethesubject, carefully avoidingadis- cussion oftherealproblem. Thecouple thought Erickson wasjustgettingtoknow them and would deal with theproblem directlythenext time hesaw them. But attheend of this first session, Dr.Erickson directed them toarrangeadinner afew nights awaythat would combine each person’sdesire: The wife wouldget theslow meal, including time spent bonding,and thehusband wouldget thebigdishes hewanted toeat.Without realizing theywere actingunder thedoctor’s gentle guidance,thecouplewould walk into amirror oftheir problem,and inthemirror theywould solve their problems themselves, endingtheevening justasthedoctor hadh0ped—by mirroringthe im- proveddinner dynamicsinbed. Indealing with more severe problems,such astheschizophrenids mirror fantasyworld ofhisorher own construction, Dr.Erickson would al- ways trytoenter themirror andwork within it,He once treated ahospital inmate who believed he was Jesus Christ-—drapingsheets around his body, talkinginvague parables,andbombardingstaff andpatientswith endless Christian proselytizing.Notherapyordrugsseemed towork, until onedayDr.Erickson wentuptotheyoungman and said, “Iunderstand youhave hadexperienceasacarpenter.” Being Christ, thepatienthad to saythat hehad had such experience,and Erickson immediately puthim to work building bookcases and other useful items, allowinghim towear his Jesus garb.Over thenext weeks, asthepatient worked onthese projects, hismind became lessoccupiedwith Jesusfantasies and more focused on hislabor. Asthecarpentry work took precedence,apsychicshift took ef- fect: Thereligious fantasies remained, butfaded comfortably into theback- ground, allowingthe man tofimction insociety. Interpretation Communication dependsonmetaphors andsymbols, which arethebasis oflanguage itself. Ametaphorisakind ofmirror totheconcrete andreal, which itoftenexpressesmore clearlyanddeeplythan aliteral description does. Whenyouaredealing with theintractable willpower ofother people, direct communication often only heightens their resistance. This happensmost clearlywhenyoucomplainabout people’sbehav- ior,particularlyinsensitive areas such astheir lovemaking.You will effect a.farmore lasting change if,like Dr.Erickson, you construct ananalogy,a symbolicmirror ofthesituation, andguide theother through it.AsChrist himself understood, talkinginparablesisoften thebest waytoteach ales- son, foritallows peopletorealize thetruth ontheir own. When dealing with peoplewho arelost inthereflections offantasy worlds (includingahost ofpeople who donotlive inmental hospitals), nevertrytopush them intoreality byshattering their mirrors. Instead, enter their world and operateinside it,under their rules, gently guiding them outofthehallofmirrors theyhave entered.
