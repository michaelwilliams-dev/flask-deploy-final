ofIs- raelinEgypt oppressed andready infleeing slavery tofollow him. Ithelped Romulus being trapped inAlba andexposed at birth tobecome King ofRome andfounder ofthatEmpire. It helped Cyrus tofindthePersians discontented under theMedes who were softandeffeminate from along period ofpeace. The- seus could nothave shown hisvirtue hadAthens notbeen dis- united. Opportunity made these men, andtheir virtue dominated theopportunity, making their homelands noble andhappy. Those whose virtues, similar tothese, overcome hardship in winning Principalities have aneasier time keeping them. Thedif- ficulties arise partly inwinning thePrincipality from having to establish newrules andorders thatthey areforced tointroduce to gain afoothold andwintheir security. One should realize that there isnothing more difficult, more dubious ofsuccess, nor more dangerous, than being aleader who introduces newways of doing things. Such aleader immediately hasforenemies allthose whom theoldways benefit, while those who getthebenefit are lukewarm supporters. This half-heartedness arises partly from fearofoldadversaries, who have theoldlawontheir side, and partly from theincredulity ofmen who never believe inthetruth ofnew orders ifnotfounded infirm experience. Sowhoever op- poses them easily finds partisans while thereformers acthesi- tantly sothattheleader founders with them. One needs inorder toexamine thistoseeclearly whether the innovators stand alone ordepend onothers —whether, togain their end, they have tobegorifthey canforce theissue. Ifthey have tobeg, italways turns outbadly andleads tonothing. Ifthey arestrong themselves andforce theissue then they rarely fail. Armed prophets win. Thedisarmed lose. Besides this, thenature ofpeoples vary —itiseasy topersuade them butdifficult tohold them toit.One needs tobeprepared sothatwhen thepopulace no longer cares youcanforce them toit. Moses, Cyrus, Theseus andRomulus would nothave been THE PRINCE —49 able tohold outlong ifthey hadnotbeen armed —ashappened inourtime toBrother Savonarola who wasruined assoon asthe populace began todisbelieve inhim. Hehadnomethod tohold those who neither believed norlineupthose who didn't believe. Allthose other personages faced grave difficulties butwere forced toovercome them —but, once having overcome, they were venerated. Having gotten ridofthose who were opposed, they survived powerful, secure, honored, andhappy. Tosuch high examples, Iwant toaddaminor one, which puts perspective onthem and will stand forallother examples: namely, Gerone IIofSyracuse. This Lord became byhimself Lord ofSyracuse with nohelp from fortune except opportunity. The Syracusans were oppressed andelected himtheir Captain, from which position hegained thePrincipality. Heshowed such virtue thatitwaswritten, "Nothing prevented himfrom ruling ex- cept having arealm torule." Heterminated theoldmilitia, cre- ated anew one, leftoffoldfriendships, andtook onnew ones. With friends andsoldiers ofhisown, hehadthefoundation for building anew sothatalthough hehadalotoftrouble inwinning, hehaditeasy tohold onafterwards. OFNEW PRINCIPALITIES WON WITH THE ARMS AND FORTUNES OFOTHERS Those who become Princes ontheir own with small effort haveexperience difficulty nohardship,keeping theironlyPrincedom;once they haveonthewonway,dothey they runintotrouble. Such arethose who take astate bybuying itor byspecial concession —ashappened inGreece, intheHelle- spont andIonia, where Darius made Princes andSatraps tomain- tainhissecurity andglory. This alsohappens where officers cor- rupt thesoldiers with money andsetupmilitary rule. Such rulers depend onthewillandfortune ofothers, always volatile andunstable. They donotknow how tobePrinces and cannot become Princes. They donotknow how because they are notmen ofgreat enterprise orvirtue, and, asprivate figures, they donotknow how tocommand. They areincapable because they have noloyal andfriendly forces oftheir own. Besides, likeall things born toosuddenly innature, they have noroots and branches, soatthefirst adversity they die. Ifthose suddenly
