warning by Han Hsin, and infuriated by what he considered the treachery of Li I-chi, ordered the unfortunate envoy to be boiled alive.] 13. SURVIVING SPIES, finally, are those who bring back news from the en- emy�s camp. 1. CHAPTER 14. THE USE OF SPIES 126 [This is the ordinary class of spies, properly so called, forming a regu- lar part of the army. Tu Mu says: "Your surviving spy must be a man of keen intellect, though in outward appearance a fool; of shabby exterior, but with a will of iron. He must be active, robust, endowed with physical strength and courage; thoroughly accustomed to all sorts of dirty work, able to endure hunger and cold, and to put up with shame and ignominy." Ho Shih tells the following story of Ta�hsi Wu of the Sui dynasty: "When he was governor of Eastern Ch�in, Shen-wu of Ch�i made a hostile move- ment upon Sha-yuan. The Emperor T�ai Tsu [? Kao Tsu] sent Ta-hsi Wu to spy upon the enemy. He was accompanied by two other men. All three were on horseback and wore the enemy�s uniform. When it was dark, they dismounted a few hundred feet away from the enemy�s camp and stealthily crept up to listen, until they succeeded in catching the passwords used in the army. Then they got on their horses again and boldly passed through the camp under the guise of night-watchmen; and more than once, hap- pening to come across a soldier who was committing some breach of dis- cipline, they actually stopped to give the culprit a sound cudgeling! Thus they managed to return with the fullest possible information about the en- emy�s dispositions, and received warm commendation from the Emperor, who in consequence of their report was able to inflict a severe defeat on his adversary."] 14. Hence it is that which none in the whole army are more intimate relations to be maintained than with spies. [Tu Mu and Mei Yao-ch�en point out that the spy is privileged to enter even the general�s private sleeping-tent.] None should be more liberally rewarded. In no other business should greater secrecy be preserved. [Tu Mu gives a graphic touch: all communication with spies should be carried "mouth-to-ear." The following remarks on spies may be quoted from Turenne, who made perhaps larger use of them than any previous commander: "Spies are attached to those who give them most, he who pays them ill is never served. They should never be known to anybody; nor should they know one another. When they propose anything very material, secure their persons, or have in your possession their wives and children as hostages for their fidelity. Never communicate anything to them but what is absolutely necessary that they should know. 2 ] 15. Spies cannot be usefully employed without a certain intuitive sagacity. [Mei Yao-ch�en says: "In order to use them, one must know fact from falsehood, and be able to discriminate between honesty and double-dealing." Wang Hsi in
