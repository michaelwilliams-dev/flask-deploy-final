by nature highly secretive, recorded in extremely difficult language, often substituting homonymic characters in a kind of cryptic code. A century deeper into the chaos of Warring States China, while retaining the ancient moral foundations of Sun Wu�s Art of War, Sun Bin went that much further than his distinguished ancestor in detailing practical tactics. Like what can be found in other strategic manuals, moreover, Sun Bin�s methods are represented by structures that operate as metaphors for events and activities other than warfare, in the domains of government, diplomacy, business, and social action. There is a Chinese saying, �The wise see wisdom, the good see goodness.� How people interact with powerful and secretive lore like The Art of War is held to reveal something about their inner character�and this function itself is a classic maneuver of strategic art. Notes 1. Cited in The Art of War in this volume. It has often been noted how much the highly competitive contemporary international marketplace resembles the Era of the Warring States. 2. For a complete translation of the esoteric classic of strategy known as The Master of Demon Valley, see Thomas Cleary, Thunder in the Sky: On the Acquisition and Exercise of Power (Boston: Shambhala, 1993). The Master of Demon Valley contains much more of the psychological, social, and political dimension of strategy in action than does Sun Tzu�s renowned The Art of War, which is more strictly military.

The shifting alliances of China�s Era of the Warring States created enormous confusion and uncertainty; and the chaotic and unpredictable nature of the political scene was ruthlessly exploited by civil and military leaders as well as by freelance consultants. To read ancient Chinese war stories like this, which do not necessarily follow a straight line, and whose action is inherently and perhaps deliberately confusing, observe the relationships and interactions as well as the overall �plot.� When King Wei of Qi (B.C.E. 356�320) heard of this, he had his general, Tian Ji, lead 80,000 armed
