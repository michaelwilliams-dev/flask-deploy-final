But oneprize plumeluded him: theindustrialist Andrew Mellon. Before hedied, Duveen was determined tomake Mellon aclient. Duveen’s friends said this was animpossible dreani. Mellon was astiff, taciturn man. The stories hehad heard about thecongenial,talkative Du- veen rubbed him thewrong way—-hehad made itclear hehad nodesire to meet the man. YetDuveen told hisdoubting friends, “Not only will Mellon buyfrom mebuthewillbuy onlyfrom me.” For severalyearshetracked hisprey, learning theman’s habits, tastes, phobias.Todothis, hesecretly putseveral ofMellon’s staff onhis ownpayroll, worming valuable informa- tion outofthem. Bythetime hemoved into action, heknew Mellon about aswell asMellon’s wife did. In1921 Mellon wasvisiting London, andstayinginapalatialsuite on thethird floor ofClaridge’sHotel. Duveen booked himself into the suite justbelow Mellon’s, onthesecond floor. Hehadarrangedforhisvalet to befriend Mellon’s valet, and onthefateful dayhehad chosen tomake his move, Mellon’s valet told Duveen’s valet, who told Duveen, that hehad justhelpedMellon onwith hisovercoat, and that theindustrialist was mak- inghiswaydown thecorridor toring forthelift. Duveen’s valet hurriedly helpedDuveen with his own overcoat. Sec» onds later, Duveen entered thelift,and loandbehold, there was Mellon. “How doyoudo,Mr.Mellon?” saidDuveen, introducinghimself. “Iam on mywaytotheNational Gallerytolook atsome pictures.”How uncanny- that waspreciselywhere Mellon was headed. And soDuveen was able to accompanyhispreytothe one location that would ensure his success. He knew Mellon’s taste inside and out, and while the two men wandered through the museum, hedazzled themagnatewith hisknowledge. Once again quite uncannily, they seemed tohave remarkablysimilar tastes. Mellon waspleasantly surprised:This was nottheDuveen hehad ex- pected.The man wascharmingandagreeable,andclearlyhadexquisite taste. When theyreturned toNew York, Mellon visited Duveen’s exclusive galleryand fellinlove with thecollection. Everything, surprisingly enough, seemed tobepreciselythekind ofwork hewanted tocollect. Forthe rest ofhislifehewas Duveen’s best and most generous client. Interpretation Aman asambitious andcompetitiveasJosephDuveen leftnothingto chance.
