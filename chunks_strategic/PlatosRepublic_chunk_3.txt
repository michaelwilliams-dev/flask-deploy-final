had not thought it through. One can search in other historica] epochs and cu1tures, but the foundations of this perspective will not be found else? where. They are inextricably linked to the founder of political philosophy. For students the story of man bound in the cave and breaking the bonds, moving out and up into the light of the sun, is the most memorable from their encounter with the Republic. This is the image of every serious student's profoundest longing, the longing for liberation from convention in order to live according to nature, andï¿½ one of the book's evidently permanent aspects. The story still exercises some of its old magic, but it now encounters a fresh obstade, for the meaning of the story is that truth is substituted for myth. Today students are taught that no such substitution is possible and that there is nothing beyond myth or "narrative." The myths of the most primitive cultures are not, it is said, qualitatively different from the narratives of the most rigorous science. Men and women must bend to the power of myth rather than try to shuck it off as philosophy wrongly used to believe. Socrates, who gaily abandons the founding myth or noble lie he himself made up for the sake of the city, looks quixo c in this light. This can be disheartening to the young person who cares, but it can be a beginning of philosophy, for he is perp]exed by area] difficu]ty in his own breast. This is another case where P]atonic radicalism is particu1ar1y time]y for us. Finally, in tenns of my OWTl experience of these last twenty-five years, after the Republic I translated Rousseau's Emile, the greatest modern book on education. Rousseau was one of the great readers of Plato, and from my time on that work I gained an even greater respect for the Republic. Emile is its natural companion, and Rousseau proved his greatness by entering the lists in worthy combat with it. He shows that Plato articulated first and best all the problems, and he himself differs only with respect to some of the solutions. If one takes the two books together, one has the basic training necessary for the educational wars. And wars they are, now that doctrine tells us that these two books are cornerstones of an outlived canon. So, I conclude, the Republic is always useful to students who read it, but now more than ever. I have corrected many minor mistranslations or misleading fonnula? tions for this second edition. I must also add that there are certainly many more I did not catch. This is regrettable but inherent in the nature of the task and the nature of this translator. [ X ] This is intended to be a literal translation. My goal-unattained-was the accuracy of William ofMoerbeke's Latin translations of Aristotle. These versions are so faithful to Aristotle's text that they are authorities for the correction of the Greek manuscripts, and they enabled Thomas . Aquinas to
