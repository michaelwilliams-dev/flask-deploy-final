an ideal reference point and as a means of transmission of technical knowledge. 3. �Happens in a short time�: this idea also refers to urgent situations. 4. The word wind has several metaphorical senses. In the common expressions referred to here, different images are evoked. In the reference to the ancient wind and the modern wind, the image is that of fashion. In the expression �the wind of such and such a family,� the meaning is �family tradition.� 5. �Deviating from the true way�: I translated the word gedo in this way, which refers to �religions other than Buddhism (for which the word naido is used), heresies, dogmas that are in conflict with the truth, an insult.� 6. The word ku has several senses: �heaven,� �sky,� �emptiness,� and �space� (see �Ku� in the appendix). In the Scroll of Heaven, Musashi uses it in the full range of its meanings, stressing the sense of emptiness. In the text, after having translated it the first two times as �heaven (or emptiness),� I used one translation or another depending on the nuance that seemed to me to be dominant at that point. 7. �Depth,� oku, and �surface,� kuchi. Kuchi literally means �mouth,� hence the image of a mouth through which entry is made and thence of an entrance or surface in relation to a depth or core. Usually for the dichotomy of �surface� and �depth,� the pair of terms omote and oku is used. 1. �The principle of the way�: dori. 2. �High level of ability�: Kidoku, which today is pronounced kitoku, literally means (1) �extraordinary, marvelous, something rare and strange, the fact of particularly excelling, a strange sign, excellent effectiveness, being deserving of praise�; (2) �the strange power of God and of Buddha.� 3. Musashi called his school Nito ichi ryu. It is possible to interpret ichi ryu simply in the sense of �my school,� but in the vocabulary of the martial arts, ichi is frequently used with the connotation of unity, the integration of multiple elements. For example, ichi ban, �a single occasion�; ichi nen, �a single intention�; and ippon, whose meaning I describe more precisely below. Nito means �two swords.� Ichi means �one,� and ryu means �school.� To say only �the School of Two Swords,� it would be enough to say nito ryu. By combining the two words nito and ichi, Musashi seems to be expressing the state of the bushi who knows how to use the two swords as one. Thus the meaning is �School of the Unity of the Two Swords,� but so as to stick with a rendering that reflects the concise rhythm of the name of Musashi�s school in Japanese, I am reserving mention of this nuance for a note only. To explain further the sense of ichi, I will take the example of the term ippon used in all the contemporary Japanese martial arts to indicate a victory. Ippon is a contraction of ichi hon, hon meaning �fundamental� or �essential.� In a training session or
