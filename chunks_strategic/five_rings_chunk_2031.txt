andthere areavariety ofsuch regimes. Socrates, ontheother hand, subjects thenonphilosophic vir- tues toaharsher scrutiny which reveals thatthey areseriously flawed. There ishence onlyonegood regime; this isruledbyphilosophers, who aretheonlymenwithnotemptation togetthebetter ofothers andex- ploit thecity.Thus, onthebasis ofaregime which cannever be,heis able tocastdoubt onthelegitimacy ofallpossible regimes. Socrates presents political lifeinthiswaywith theintention of benefiting Glaucon andAdeimantus. He isintheprocess ofleading themback tothelevel ofordinary political lifeafter their brief ascent toward thesun.Theymust liveinthecity, asmustmostmen.Buthe wishes them toseethecity inthelight ofwhat theyhave learned in their ascent; their vision oftheirworld mustbetransformed. Adeiman- tusmustnolonger seephilosophy asanenemy ofthecity,andGlaucon mustnolonger betempted bytyranny. Socrates accomplishes thisby taking thehighest kindofindividual andconstructing aregime around him.Hethusappeals toAdeimantus, bygiving political status tothat human type,andtoGlaucon, byshowing him aruler forwhom the practice ofjustice appears tobeanunqualified good.Theyoungman whowishes tolivewell willpfay forthat cityand itswayoflife.But thisultimately means thathewill, intheabsence ofthatregime, desire toliveaprivate life,forthatgood life isshown tobepossible without theregime; itdoesnotdepend, asdotheotherways oflife,onruling in thecity. Itisself-sufficient andalways available tohimwhochooses it. Socrates' political science, paradoxically, ismeant toshow the superiority oftheprivate life.Themost important pointmade inthis section isthatwhile thebest city exists only inmyth, thebestman ex- istsactually. [415 ] THEREPUBLIC Socrates' account oftheregimes diverges fromcommon sense in thatheinsists thatthebestregime came firstandthat after itthere isa necessary downward movement ofdecay totimocracy, oligarchy, democracy, and finally, tyranny. This issupported neither byargument norbyhistory. Aristotle inhisdiscussion ofthevarious regimes does notargue thatoneregime must necessarily emerge from another; worse regimes can certainly precede better ones.Theargument ofthe Republic itself hasindicated thattheregime ofthephilosophers, or aristocracy, isnot firstbutnecessarily lastintime. Itisfurthest away frominnocence; itrequires experience; itistheresult ofagreatand re- centprogress inunderstanding, thediscovery ofphilosophy. Ashasbeen suggested, Socrates, contrary tofact,places thebestregime firstinor- derthatthequest forwisdom notappear tobeinconflict with the political prejudice infavor oftheancestral. Aristophanes, inthe Clouds, accused Socrates ofteaching wise sons tobeatunwise fathers. IfSocrates describes thedecay ofregimes correctly, therewould never bealegitimate ground forbeating one's father; ineach successive downward step theson isinferior tothefather. Thequest forself- improvement would beidentical torespect forone's forebears. More- over, thebelief inperfect beginnings here expressed istheresponse toGlaucon's suggestion that civil society isamere compact be- tweenmenwho prefer todo,rather than suffer, injustice, andwho joined together onlybecause ofthesuffering involved intheir original estate. Intheaccount given bySocrates, thefoundings ororigins of civil society arenotininjustice andtheblood oftheinnocent, andthe pastdoes notprovide amodel fortyrannic methods ofrule.The harsh facts ofthefoundings ofcities arecovered overbecause ofthe temptations engendered bytheir example. Glaucon, inhisfirstspeech onjustice, asserted thatathing could beunderstood byitsorigin, or that itsorigin isitsnature. Socrates taught, inthediscussion ofthe ideas, thattheend,nottheorigin, ofathing isitsnature. Hereheap- peals toGlaucon's faulty philosophic understanding byputting what is really theendattheorigin. Finally, itmustbestressed again thatthere isadownward movement oftheregimes, thatthere isnoindication that thistrend canbereversed, andthatthefinaltyranny doesnotlead back again toward oneofthesuperior regimes. Itisthefault ofman, notofgods ornature, thatdecay occurs, butoncehaving occurred, the original stateofinnocence cannot berecovered. Atbestmencanstrug- gleagainst further decay, buttheycannot hope toestablish thebest regime bytheirown effort.Bythismode ofpresentation Socrates teach- esGlaucon andAdeimantus thattheancestral istruly respectable be- [416 Interpretive Essay cause itwaswiseandjust,andthat itcannot beimproved upon. Thus hemakes themmoderate without being closed toreason, asrespect for what istruly ancestral would make them. Socrates andAdeimantus discuss each oftheregimes before they discuss themancorresponding toit.Therefore, theyhave thetendency (aswasthecase inBook IV)toseeinthemanwhat theysaw inthe city.Thispredetermines thesomewhat questionable result thatmen have thesame rankorder ofgoodness which wasfound inregimes. For example, there issomedoubt whether amanwhopursues money alone issimply preferable toonewho
