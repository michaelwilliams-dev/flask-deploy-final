feasts on earth, have grown around it in a wild, earthy, and rocky profu? sion as a result of those feasts that are called happy. And then one would see its true nature-whether it is many-formed or single-formed, or in what way it is and how. But now, as I suppose, we have fairly gone through its affections and forms in its human life." ï¿½ "That's entirely certain," he said. "In the argument," I said, "haven't we both cleared away the other parts of the criticism and also not brought in the wages and reputations connected with justice as you said Hesiod and Homer do? But we found that justice by itself is best for soul itself, and that the soul must do the just things, whether it has Gyges' ring or not, and, in addition to such a ring, Hades' cap."10 "What you say is very true," he said. "Then, Glaucon," I said, "isn't it now, at last, unobjectionable, in addition, also to give back to justice and the rest of virtue the wages-in their quantity and in their quality-that they procure for 611 b C d e 612 a b C 612 C d e 613 a b the soul from human beings and gods, both while the human being is still alive and when he is dead?"

Or don't you remember?" "If I didn't," he said, "I should indeed be doing an injustice." "We11, then," I said, "since they have been judged, on justice's behalf I ask back again the reputation it in fact has among gods and among human beings; and I ask us to agree that it does enjoy such a reputation, so that justice may also carry off the prizes that it gains from seeming and bestows on its possessors, since it has made dear that it bestows the good things that come from being and does not deceive those who really take possession of it." "What you ask," he said, "is only just." "Then," I said, "won't you first give this back: that it doesn't escape the notice of gods, at least, what each of the two men is?" "Yes," he said, "we shall give that back." "And if they don't escape notice, the one would be dear to the gods and the other hateful, as we also agreed at the beginning?" "That's so." "And won't we agree that everything that comes to the man dear to the gods-insofar as it comes from gods-is the best possible, except for any necessary evil that was
