had social instincts unknown toclay—the passage ofcenturies hasblunted them. Citizens inthe true sense oftheword, the Athenians sensed thedangers posed byasocial behavior, and saw how such behavior often disguisesitself inother forms: theholier-tharythou at- titude thatsilentlyseeks toimposeitsstandards onothers; overweening ambition attheexpense ofthe common good; theflauntingofsuperiority; quiet scheming;terminal obnoxiousness. Some ofthese behaviors would eatawayatthecity’s cohesion bycreating factions andsowing dissension, others would ruin thedemocratic spirit bymaking the common citizen feel inferior and envious. The Athenians did nottrytoreeducate people who acted inthese ways,ortoabsorb them somehow into thegroup,orto imposeaviolent punishmentthat would onlycreate other problems. The solution wasquickand effective: Getridofthem. Withinany group, trouble can most often betraced toasingle source, theunhappy, chronicallydissatisfied one who willalwaysstirupdissen- sion and infect thegroupwith his orherillease.

Chinese saying OBSERVANCE OFTHE LAW II In1296 thecardinals oftheCatholic Church met inRome toselect anew pope. They chose Cardinal Gaetani, forhe wasincomparably shrewd; such aman would make theVatican agreat power. Takingthe name Boni~ faceVIII, Gaetani soon proved hedeserved thecardinals’ high opinion of him: Heplottedhis moves carefullyinadvance, andstoppedatnothingto gethisway.Once inpower,Boniface quicklycrushed hisrivals and uni- fied thePapalStates. The European powers began tofear him, and sent delegatestonegotiate with him. The German KingAlbrecht ofAustria even yieldedsome territorytoBoniface. All wasproceeding accordingto thepope’s plan. One piece did notfallintoplace, however, and that wasTuscany,the richest partofItaly. IfBoniface couldconquer Florence, Tuscany’smost powerful city,theregion would behis.ButFlorence was aproud republic, andwould behard todefeat. Thepopehad toplayhiscards skillfully. Florence wasdivided bytworival factions, theBlacks and theWhites. The Whites were themerchant families that hadrecentlyandquickly risen topowerandwealth; theBlacks were theolder money. Because of theirpopularitywith thepeople,theWhites retained control ofthecity,to theBlacks’ increasingresentment. The feud between thetwo grew steadily more bitter. Here Boniface saw hischance: Hewould plottohelptheBlacks take over thecity,and Florence would beinhispocket.And ashestudied the situation hebegan tofocus on one man, Dante Alighieri, thecelebrated writer, poet,and ardent supporter oftheWhites. Dante hadalwaysbeen interested inpolitics.Hebelieved passionately intherepublic, and often chastised hisfellow citizens for their lack ofspine.Healsohappenedtobe thecity’smost eloquent public speaker.In1300, theyearBoniface began plotting totake over Tuscany,Dante’s fellow citizens had voted him into Florence’s highestelectedposition, makinghim one ofthecity’ssixpri- ors.During hissix-month term inthepost,hehad stood firmly against the Blacks andagainstallofthepope’s attemptstosow disorder. By1301, however, Boniface had anewplan:Hecalled inCharles de Valois, powerful brother oftheking ofFrance, tohelp bring order toTus» cany.AsCharles marched throughnorthern Italy,and Florence seethed withanxietyand fear, Dante quickly emergedasthe man who could rallyTHE \V(lL\'l:‘.‘s‘ \\4‘l) Ull’. .<lIF.l£l’ Once upon(1lime, the wolves sent anembassy 10thesheep.
