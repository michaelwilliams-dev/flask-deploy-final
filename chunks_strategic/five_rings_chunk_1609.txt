thecharacter shehad created; instead ofconductingaffairs with famous men, shewould begin meddlinginpolitics, leading demonstrations, inspir- ingstudent rebellions. No onewould dictate toherthelimits ofthecharac- tershehad created. Long after shedied, and after most peoplehadstopped readinghernovels, thelarger-than—life theatricality ofthat character has continued tofascinate andinspire. Interpretation ThroughoutSand’s public life,acquaintancesand other artists who spent time inhercompanyhad thefeeling theywere inthepresence ofaman. Butinherjournals and toherclosest friends, such asGustave Flaubert, she confessed that shehad nodesire tobe aman, but wasplayingapartfor public consumption.What shereallywanted was thepowertodetermine her own character. She refused thelimits hersocietywould have setonher. Shedid not attain her power, however, bybeing herself; instead she cre- ated apersonathat shecould constantly adapttoher own desires,aper- sona that attracted attention andgaveherpresence.

Infact, theidea ofself—creation comes from theworld ofart.Forthou- LAW 25 195 196 LAW 25sands ofyears, only kingsand thehighestcourtiers had thefreedom to shape their public imageand determine their ownidentity. Similarly, only kingsand thewealthiest lords could contemplate their own imageinart, andconsciously alter it.The rest ofmankind played thelimited role that societydemanded ofthem, and had little selficonsciousness.

The painting representsadramatic change inthedynamics ofpower and theabilitytodetermine one’s own positioninsociety.ForVelazquez, theartist, isfarmore prominently positioned than theking andqueen. Ina sense heismore powerfulthan they are, since heisclearly the one control» lingtheirnage--their image. Velazqueznolongersaw himself astheslav- ish,dependentartist. Hehad remade himself into aman ofpower. And indeed thefirstpeople other than aristocrats toplay openly with their imageinWesternsocietywere artists andwriters, and later ondandies and bohemians.
