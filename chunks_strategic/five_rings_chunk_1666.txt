OBSERVANCE OFTHE LAW When Christopher Columbus wastryingtofindfunding forhislegendary voyages, manyaround him believed hecame from theItalian aristocracy. This view waspassedintohistory throughabiographywritten after the ex- plorer’sdeath byhisson, which describes him asadescendant ofaCount Colombo oftheCastle ofCuccaro inMontferrat. Colombo inturn was said tobedescended from thelegendary Roman general Colonius, and twoof hisfirst cousins were supposedly direct descendants ofanemperor ofCon stantinople.Anillustrious backgroundindeed. But itwasnothingmore than illustrious fantasy,forColumbus wasactuallythe sonofDomenico Colombo,ahumble weaver who hadopenedawine shop when Christa» pherwas ayoung man, and who then made hisliving byselling cheese. Columbus himself had created themyth ofhisnoble background, be- cause from earlyonhefelt thatdestiny had singledhim out forgreat things, and that hehad akind ofroyaltyinhisblood. Accordinglyheacted asifhewere indeed descended from noble stock. After anuneventful ca- reer as amerchant on 3commercial vessel, Columbus, Originallyfrom Genoa, settled inLisbon. Using thefabricated story ofhisnoble back ground,hemarried into anestablished Lisbon family that had excellent connections with Portuguese royalty. Through hisin—laws, Columbus finagledameetingwith thekingof Portugahjoao II,whom hepetitionedtofinance awestwardvoyage aimed atdiscoveringashorter route toAsia. Inreturn forannouncingthatany discoveries heachieved would bemade inthekings name, Columbus Ihwanted aseries ofrights: thetitle Grand Admiral oftheOceanic Sea; the office ofViceroyoveranylands hefound; and 10percentofthefuture commerce with such lands. Allofthese rightswere tobehereditaryandfor alltime. Columbus made these demands even thoughhehadpreviously been amere merchant, heknew almost nothing about navigation,hecould notwork aquadrant,and hehad never led agroupofmen. Inshort hehad absolutelynoqualificationsforthejourneyheproposed. Furthermore, his petitionincluded nodetails astohow hewould accomplishhisplans, just vague promises. “Then Columbus finished hispitch, joao IIsmiled: Hepolitelyde- clined theoffer, butleftthedooropenforthefuture. Here Columbus must have noticed somethinghewould never forget: Even astheking turned down the sailor’s demands, hetreated them aslegitimate. Heneither laughedatColumbus norquestioned hisbackgroundand credentials. In factthekingwasimpressed bytheboldness ofColumbus’srequests,and clearlyfeltcomfortable inthecompany ofaman who acted soconfidently. Themeetingmust have convinced Columbus that hisinstincts were cor‘ rect:Byaskingforthemoon, hehadinstantly raised his own status, forthe king assumed that unless aman who setsuch ahigh priceonhimself were mad, which Columbus didnotappear tobe,hemust somehow beworth it. Afew years later Columbus moved toSpain. UsinghisPortuguese connections, hemoved inelevated circles attheSpanish court, receiving subsidies from illustrious financiers and sharing tables with dukes and princes.Toallthese men berepeated hisrequestforfinancing for avoyage tothewe-st——and also fortherights hehad demanded from joao II.Some, such asthepowerfulduke ofMedina, wanted tohelp,butcould not, since they lacked thepowertogrant him thetitles andrightshewanted, But Columbus would not back down.
