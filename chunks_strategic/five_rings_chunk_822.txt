Both Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse were ruthless businessmen who took credit for Tesla’s work. In the end, Tesla was living in poverty, while royalties for his life’s work went to Edison and Westinghouse. He accepted small sums as buy-outs for his work, when in reality his creations could have been worth millions. Even Marconi made use of a patent filed by Tesla in 1897. Tesla was the real “father of radio” but received no money or credit for this invention.

MAKE OTHER PEOPLE COME TO YOU – USE BAIT IF NECESSARY. • O b s e r v a n c e o f t h e L a w Napoleon’s former foreign minister Talleyrand was master of this law. He knew Napoleon loved the adoration of the masses, and this was the perfect bait to make the former ruler play into the hands of his opponents. In 1814 Napoleon was banished to a small island called Elba near Italy. Here he was given information that France would embrace him again if he escaped. From Elba he was able to escape and march back into Paris with a small army. The people bowed to him, and soldiers changed sides to join him. The statesmen who had taken over his empire fled. Talleyrand watched as his plan unfolded. Napoleon ruled France again for a hundred days, but the country was bankrupt and could not sustain Napoleon’s wars any longer. Napoleon was recaptured at the Battle of Waterloo and exiled to the barren island St. Helena, off the west coast of Africa. This was a much further place with no chance of escape, and was more to Talleyrand’s liking.
