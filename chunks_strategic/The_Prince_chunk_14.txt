Kingdoms of Naples and of Sicily for the King of Spain. Such dominions are acquired , whether they were accustomed to living under a Prince , or whether they lived free -and they are acquired either with the arms of others or with one's own, either by fortune or by valor . OF HEREDITARY PRINCES etPrincipalingel ty and,, shallcussionopiturn mythe argumentexclusI havely in with ewher di g Republics, whichoutlined aside the I deve of attention v dealt theS to the first chapter above, I will consider how the Principality can be governed and sustained. In hereditary states ruled by a bloodline there are fewer diffi.culties of rule than in new states, because it is enough not to di.verge from the old order and to temporize against unforeseen de.velopments. Doing this, even an ordinary Prince can maintain his state, unless an extraordinary happening deprives him of it � and even then, as soon as his foe runs into trouble, he can easily gain back his Principality. In Italy we have good examples of this such as the Duke of Ferrara, who withstood the attack of the Venetians in 1484 and of Pope Julius II in 1510 for no other reason than having a long he.reditary claim. This is because a natural Prince with a long he.reditary line is less likely to give offense; he is more likely to be appreciated; and if he is not given to vices that make him hated, it is pretty usual for him to be held in his subjects' affections. Tradition and custom of rule dims the memory and the causes of the original rise to power � otherwise, one change only leads to another if memories of change are not forgotten. MIXED PRINCIPALITIES Itis in even if thenew Princ pality that the difficulty arises. Firstly, a Principality is not completely new, but a new part of one � and this we can call a mixed Principality � then the possibility of changes arise from a problem natural to all new Principalities: namely, that men change leaders gladly in hopes of improvement their lot. This belief leads them to take arms in against the new leader too, because they have been deceived and see from experience that things have gotten worse. This happens usually and quite necessarily because a new leader always of.fends his new subjects either by using force or by other injustices associated with the acquisition of a new Principality. Obviously, those you offend become your enemies. You cannot satisfy your friends either because their expectations are disappointed too, or can you oppose them since they helped you. Indeed, even you if are well armed, whenever you enter a new province you need the help of provincial leaders. This was why Louis XII in 1499 first took Milan, then lost it in 1500. Getting help at first from Ludo.vico the Black's own forces, these forces soon saw that they were deceived, that their hopes were betrayed, and that they could not put up with
