assemble, they constitute the most numerous and most sovereign class in a democracy." "Yes, they do," he said. "But they aren't willing to assemble very frequently unless they get some share of the honey." d e 565a '565a b C d e "Therefore, they always getï¿½a share," I said, "to the extent that the leaders, in taking away the substance of those who have it. and distributing it among the people, are able to keep the greatest part for themselves." "Yes," he said, "they do get a share in that way." "Then I suppose that those men whose property is taken away are compelled to defend themselves by speaking before the people and by doing whatever they can." "Of course." "For this they are charged by the others, even if they don't desire to make innovations, with plotting against the people and being oligarchs." "Of course."

"Isn't it also the same for the leader of a people who, taking over a particularly obedient mob, does not hold back from shedding the blood of his tribe but unjustly brings charges against a man-which is exactly what they usually do---and, bringing him before the court, mur? ders him, and, doing away with a man's life, tastes of kindred blood [ 244] with unholy tongue and mouth, and banishes, and kills, and hints at cancellations of debts and redistributions of land; isn't it also necessarily fated, I say, that after this such a man either be slain by his enemies or be tyrant and turn from a human being into a wolf?" "Quite necessarily," he said. "Then this," I said, "is the man who incites faction against those who have wealth." "This is he." "If he's exiled and comes back in spite of his enemies, does he come
