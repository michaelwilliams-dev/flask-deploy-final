would be to keep quiet, but if there were some necessity to tell, as few as possible ought to hear them as unspeakable secrets, after making a sacrifice, not of a pig but of some great offering that's hard to come by, so that it will come to the ears of the smallest possible num? ber." "These speeches are indeed harsh," he said. "And they mustn't be spoken in our city, Adeimantus," I said. "Nor must it be said within the hearing of a young person that in doing the extremes of injustice, or that in punishing the unjust deeds of his father in every way, he would do nothing to be wondered at, but would 377 b C d e 378 a b 378 b C d e 379 a b be doing only what the first and the greatest of the gods did." "No, by Zeus," he said. "To say this doesn't seem fitting to me either." "Above all," I said, "it mustn't be said that gods make war on gods, and plot against them and have battles with them-for it isn't even true-provided that those who are going to guard the city for us must consider it most shameful40 to be easily angry with one another. They are far from needing to have tales told and embroideries woven4I about battles of giants and the many diverse disputes of gods and heroes with their families and kin. But if we are somehow going to per? suade them that no citizen ever was angry with another and that to be so is not holy, it's just such things that must be told the children right away by old men and women; and as they get older, the poets must be compelled to make up speeches for them which are close to these. But Hera's bindings by her son,42 and Hephaestus' being cast out by his fatherï¿½ when he was about to help out his mother who was being beaten,43 and all the battles of the gods Homer44 made, must not be accepted in the city, whether they are made with a hidden sense or without a hidden sense. A young thing can't judge what is hidden sense and what is not; but what he takes into his opinions at that age has a tendency to become hard to eradicate and unchangeable. Perhaps it's for this reason that we must do everything to insure that what they hear first, with respect to virtue, be the finest told tales for them to hear." "That's reasonable," he said. "But if someone should at this point ask us what they are and which tales we mean, what would we say?" And I said, "Adeimantus, you and I aren't poets right now but founders of a city. It's appropriate for founders to know the models ac? cording to which the poets must tell their tales. If what the poets pro? duce goes counter to these models, founders must not give way; however, they must
