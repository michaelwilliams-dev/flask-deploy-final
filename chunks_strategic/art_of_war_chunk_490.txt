I taken the usual course, I should never have been able to bring my colleague round. What says the Military Classic��Swoop down on the market-place and drive the men off to fight.� CHAPTER 12. THE NINE SITUATIONS 112 [This passage does not occur in the present text of Sun Tzu.] If I had not placed my troops in a position where they were obliged to fight for their lives, but had allowed each man to follow his own discretion, there would have been a general debandade, and it would have been impossible to do anything with them." The officers admitted the force of his argument, and said: "These are higher tactics than we should have been capable of." [See CH�IEN HAN SHU, ch. 34, ff. 4, 5.] ] 59. For it is precisely when a force has fallen into harm�s way that is capable of striking a blow for victory. [Danger has a bracing effect.] 60.
