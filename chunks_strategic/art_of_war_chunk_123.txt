prefigures a major movement in modern scientific thought following the climax of the Western divorce of religion and science centuries ago. The monkey king in the story exercised power without wisdom, disrupting the natural order and generally raising hell until he ran into the limits of matter, where he was finally trapped. There he lost the excitement of impulsive enthusiasm, and he was eventually released to seek the science of essence, under the strict condition that his knowledge and power were to be controlled by compassion, the expression of wisdom and unity of being. The monkey�s downfall finally comes about when he meets Buddha, whom the Taoist celestial immortals summon to deal with the intractable beast. The immortals had attempted to �cook� him in the �cauldron of the eight trigrams,� that is, to put him through the training of spiritual alchemy based on the Taoist I Ching, but he had jumped out still unrefined. Buddha conquers the monkey�s pride by demonstrating the insuperable law of universal relativity and has him imprisoned in �the mountain of the five elements,� the world of matter and energy, where he suffers the results of his arrogant antics. After five hundred years, at length Guanyin (Kuan Yin), the trans-historical Buddhist saint traditionally honored as the personification of universal compassion, shows up at the prison of the now repentant monkey and recites this telling verse: Too bad the magic monkey didn�t serve the public As he madly flaunted heroics in days of yore. With a cheating heart he made havoc In the gathering of immortals; With grandiose gall he went for his ego To the heaven of happiness. Among a hundred thousand troops, None could oppose him; In the highest heavens above He had a threatening presence. But since he was stymied on meeting our Buddha, When will he ever reach out and show his achievements again? Now the monkey pleads with the saint for his release. The saint grants this on the condition that the monkey devote himself to the quest for higher enlightenment, not only for himself but for society at large. Finally, before letting the monkey go to set out on the long road ahead, as a precaution the saint places a ring around the monkey�s head, a ring that will tighten and cause the monkey severe pain whenever a certain spell invoking compassion is said in response to any new misbehavior on the part of the monkey. The Art of War has been known for a hundred generations as the foremost classic of strategy; but perhaps its greatest wizardry lies in the ring of compassion that Master Sun slips over the head of every warrior who tries to use this book. And as history shows, the magic spell that tightens its grip is chanted whenever a warrior forgets the ring.
