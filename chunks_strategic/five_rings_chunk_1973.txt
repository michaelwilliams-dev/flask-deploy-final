notthatofalaw-abiding man.Only theRepublic makes the attempt todefine justice andelaborate thescience which cangive ground tosuch adefinition. In it,Socrates— whohadargued inthe [308 ] Interpretive Essay Apology thathisonlyknowledge wasignorance andwhohadthusap- parently admitted hisincompetence inpolitical things— presents ateach- ingabout thenature ofthings political. That teaching culminates inthefamous declaration that"unless philosophers rule askings, orthosenow called kings andchiefs gen- uinely andadequately philosophize . ..there isnorestfrom illsfor thecities ...nor, Ithink, forhuman kind. ..."Thismeans thatthere is aperfect harmony between philosophy andthecity, science and so- ciety. Socrates hasreformed philosophy sothat itisnowtheonething most needful forthecity;andthephilosopher isitsgreatest benefactor. We are,however, likely tobemisled bythisapparent Socratic op- timism concerning thebestcase— theregime where philosophers rule. Careful reading will reveal that thisalleged harmony ismore ofa paradox thanasolution, that itcovers ahostoftensions which come to light inthelessthan perfect cases. Socrates maywellhavereformed philosophy sothat itwasnolonger indifferent topolitics, but itwas certainly nolesssubversive ofallexisting regimes thanwastheolder philosophy. Ifphilosophers arethenatural rulers, they aretherivals of alltheactual rulers; philosophy, rather than being simply useless, seems tobeconspiratorial. Philosophy mayvery wellbeharmful toreal regimes, and itisvery unlikely thattheregime atwhich itaims can come intobeing. Infact, theRepublic tacitly admits thetruth ofthe charges made against Socrates: heisnotorthodox inhisbeliefs about thegodsand setsupnewbeings, theideas, which aresuperior tothe gods; thephilosophers hetrains willbemenwhobothknow thenature ofthings intheairandbelow theearthandareable tospeak withcon- summate skill;andheteaches youngmen todespise Athens because he teaches them tolovearegime inwhich philosophers arekings. Socrates denies thatheisunjust because ofthis,buttheremustbearevolution inmen's understanding ofjustice forjustdeeds toberecognized as such. Inallimperfect regimes, hispresence isproblematic, andhemust behave prudently: heundermines theattachment totheregime and lawsofthecity,butheisthesalvation ofallthose initwhowish tolive thegood life. TheRepublic shows uswhySocrates wasaccused andwhy there wasgood reason toaccuse him.Notonlydoeshetellusabout thegood regime, butweseehiseffectontheyoungmenhewassaidtohave cor- rupted. Socrates, inleading them toajustice which isnotAthenian, or even Greek, but israther human, precisely because itisrational, shows theway tothetruth about political things anddevelops theextremely complex relationship ofthattruth tocivil society. These questions are most relevant tomodern man, although they areperhaps harder for [309 ] THEREPUBLIC him tounderstand than formen ofanyprevious generation. They are relevant tohimbecause headmits hisneed for"values" andbecause theprogress ofpublicly useful science nowthreatens himwith destruc- tion;theyareharder forhimtounderstand because hehasbeen taught that"values" cannot beestablished byreason andthatscience issimply salutary forsociety. Forthese reasons itbehooves ustostudy theRepublic. For itis the firstbookwhich brings philosophy "down intothecities"; andwe watch initthefoundation ofpolitical science, theonly discipline which canbring theblessings ofreason tothe city.Wewilllearn thatthe establishment ofpolitical science cannot becarried outwithout sacrifice ofthedearest convictions and interests ofmostmen; these sacrifices aresogreat thattomany theydonotseemworthwhile: oneof themost civilized cities which hasever existed thought itbetter to sacrifice philosophy intheperson ofSocrates rather than facethe al- ternative hepresented. This iswhyphilosophy needs anapology; itisa dangerous andessentially questionable activity. Socrates knew thathis interests were not,andcould notbe,theinterests ofmostmenandtheir cities.Wefrequently donotseethisandassume thathisexecution was aresult oftheblind prejudices ofthepast.Therefore wedonotseethe trueradicalness ofthephilosophic life.TheRepublic isthebest an- tidote toourprejudice. Theproper starting point forthestudy ofSo- cratic philosophy isthenonphilosophic orientation ofthecitywithin which philosophy must take itsplace. Hostility tophilosophy isthe natural condition ofmanandthecity. Socrates, inadmitting hisguilt, willshowwhat higher concerns pardon him for it.
