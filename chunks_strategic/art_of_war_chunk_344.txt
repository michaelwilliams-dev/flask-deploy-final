to devise effective structures through which force can be concentrated and given aim is an established strategic priority, but it is complicated by the fact that even an effective formulation loses its edge once it has become routine. As Sun Wu points out, �Usually, battle is engaged in a conventional manner but is won by surprise tactics Surprise and convention give rise to each other in cycles.� Once a tactic has become habitual, its effectiveness is lost; the enemy can see through the strategy and be prepared with a counter maneuver. Thus Sun Bin warns, �Whoever has form can be defined, and whoever can be defined can be overcome.� This is not only a basic principle of defensive warfare; it is also fundamental to offense, as explained by Sun Wu in these terms: �If you induce others to adopt a form while you remain formless, then you will be concentrated while the enemy will be divided.� Formlessness, which also means fluidity of form, is thus not merely defensive but is also effective as an offensive posture. Sun Bin says, �A militia is not to rely on a fixed formation,� because fixation leads to exhaustion, paralysis, and loss of opportunity. Thus Sun Wu teaches, The consummate formation of a militia is to reach formlessness. Where there is no specific form, even deeply placed agents cannot spy it out; even the canny strategist cannot scheme against it. This does not mean that there is no form whatsoever, but that there is no fixed form, as Sun Bin explains: Form is a matter of using whatever is superior to win. It is impossible to use the best of one form to overcome all forms. Therefore control of forms is one, but the means of victory cannot be only one. The idea that fluid adaptability underlies successful strategy is made quite clear in the corresponding dictum of Sun Wu that �A militia has no permanently fixed configuration, no constant form. Those who are able to seize victory by adapting to opponents are called experts.� The need for flexibility is emphasized in strategic literature partly because variation is in the nature of things, as Sun Wu notes in remarking that �No element is always dominant, no season is always present.� The ability to change tactics is not only necessary for adaptation to external changes in circumstances; it is strategically necessary in order to baffle opponents. Sun Wu brings this out when he says, �The task of a military action is to unobtrusively deceive the minds of enemies,� and Sun Bin confirms that �Experts drive their enemies to their wits� ends.� Thus Sun Wu advises, When the enemy presents an opening, be sure to penetrate at once. Preempt what the enemy prefers, secretly anticipating him. Act with discipline and adapt to the opposition in order to settle the contest. This fluid skillfulness is described by Sun Bin in these terms: �To respond to a form with a form is directness, to respond to form without form
