What ifhebroadcasts liesasameans toconfuse theenemy: Would weadmire him?

Machiavelli denies attributes ofvirtue tothose who, incapacity ofleadership, usethe means forthemselves personally andnotforthose whom they represent orgovern. Machiavelli’s concern isthatleaders, atall levels, need tofulfill theroleofgoverning forthebenefit ofthe people, andtodefend them atallcosts. Virtue does notnecessarily stand alone asthemost important attribute ofthose inprivate orpublic life.Thesecond most im- portant attribute isastuteness, which means strength, street smart. Itscounter partwould beweakness orappeasement —attributes thatgenerate danger andself-destruction. Leaders have tobevir- tuous andastute, diligent intheir comportment asthecaretakers oftheir people, andbeaware ofwhat other leaders andnations do.Machiavelli would build dams before notafter floods. Ifariver brings water from another nation, Machiavelli’s Prince would want toknow who andhow theleaders andtheir people control theflow ofwater. Theastute Prince would con- tinuously beconcerned with thatwater flow andbeready totake control ofitifhisnation’s survival isthreatened. Notwithstanding positive ornegative results from actions taken, even iftheaction istoinsure proper resources forhisna- tion, thePrince’s means toachieve hisendwould come under the same scrutiny aswith thegeneral. Hisvirtue transcends thedetails ofthemeans when leaders areinthethrows ofmaking important decisions. Thequestions, however, arethesame foreveryone. IfPresident, what isbestfor hispeople? IfCEO, what isbest forhiscompany? Ifatyrant, what isbestforhimself? Ifpriest, what isbest forhisflock? Concerning thelatter, priests swear todedicate their lives in upholding andprotecting theflock. When they turn their flock intoprey, they become vicious andtreacherous, unlike wolves, 10— Niccolò Machiavelli which nurture their young andprotect them against other preda- tors. And, when their criminally predatory actsgoun-answered bychurch administrators andgounpunished bycivil authorities, they continue toharm their victims andturnthecommunity into onecontinuous Calvary. Regarding these men ofthecloth, Ma- chiavelli would beharsher than Dante —remember thenumber ofpriests populating Hell? Inseeing thechurch infiltrated, Machiavelli would have been thefirst tocondemn thePope, hiscardinals andthepublic offi- cials who allowed ittohappen.
