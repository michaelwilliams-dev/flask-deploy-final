there are several others whose work has not come down to us. The SUI SHU mentions four, namely Wang Ling (often quoted by Tu Yu as Wang Tzu); Chang Tzu- shang; Chia Hsu of Wei;47 and Shen Yu of Wu. The T�ANG SHU adds Sun Hao, and the T�UNG CHIH Hsiao Chi, while the T�U SHU mentions a Ming commentator, Huang Jun-yu. It is possible that some of these may have been merely collectors and editors of other commentaries, like Chi T�ien-pao and Chi Hsieh, mentioned above. 1.4 Appreciations of Sun Tzu Sun Tzu has exercised a potent fascination over the minds of some of China�s greatest men. Among the famous generals who are known to have studied his pages with en- thusiasm may be mentioned Han Hsin (d. 196 B.C.),48 Feng I (d. 34 A.D.),49 Lu Meng (d. 219),50 and Yo Fei (1103-1141).51 The opinion of Ts�ao Kung, who disputes with Han Hsin the highest place in Chinese military annals, has already been recorded.52 Still more remarkable, in one way, is the testimony of purely literary men, such as Su Hsun (the father of Su Tung-p�o), who wrote several essays on military topics, all of which owe their chief inspiration to Sun Tzu. The following short passage by him is preserved in the YU HAI:53 Sun Wu�s saying, that in war one cannot make certain of conquering,54 is very different indeed from what other books tell us.55 Wu Ch�i was a man of the same stamp as Sun Wu: they both wrote books on war, and they are linked together in popular speech as "Sun and Wu." But Wu Ch�i�s remarks on war are less weighty, his rules are rougher and more crudely stated, and there is not the same unity of plan as in Sun Tzu�s work, where the style is terse, but the meaning fully brought out. The following is an extract from the "Impartial Judgments in the Garden of Literature" by Cheng Hou: 46T�UNG K�AO, loc. cit. 47A notable person in his day. His biography is given in the SAN KUO CHIH, ch. 10. 48See XI. ss. 58, note. 49HOU HAN SHU, ch. 17 ad init. 50SAN KUO CHIH, ch. 54. 51SUNG SHIH, ch. 365 ad init. 52The few Europeans who have yet had an opportunity of acquainting themselves with Sun Tzu are not behindhand in their praise. In this connection, I may perhaps be excused for quoting from a letter from Lord Roberts, to whom the sheets of the present work were submitted previous to publication: "Many of Sun Wu�s maxims are perfectly applicable to the present day, and no. 11 [in Chapter VIII] is one that the people of this country would do well to take to heart." 53Ch. 140. 54See IV. ss. 3. 55The allusion may be to Mencius VI. 2. ix. 2. CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 22 Sun Tzu�s 13 chapters are not only the staple and base of all military men�s training, but also compel the most careful attention of scholars and
