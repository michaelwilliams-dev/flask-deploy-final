scientist, the I Ching is a book of strategic assessments, whose design is supposed to help the individual lead a more rational and effective life. Its structure is based on a quadrangle of four fundamental sets of ideas, on which revolves a cycle of three hundred and sixty states of opportunity. The number three hundred and sixty corresponds to the days of the lunar year, which in turn is emblematic of totality and completeness. These states are grouped into sixty major configurations, represented by symbolic signs, or hexagrams, consisting of six elements each. Every hexagram is given a name and a theme, which stands for some aspect of life and development in the midst of change. This is accompanied by observations and images of possibility and change that can take place within human relationships under such conditions, when analogous opportunities develop in the course of events. The six elements within each hexagram are also accompanied by observations and images that further analyze the theme from different points of view, according to the various relative positions in which people may find themselves under given conditions. The two themes in the I Ching that are most prominently relevant to a study of I Ching influence in The Art of War would be those of the sixth and seventh hexagrams, �Contention� and �The Army.� Considered in succession according to the traditional order of study used for temporal events, the observations of these two I Ching themes form an outline of classical thinking on the structure of conflict response. The statement of the I Ching on the hexagram for �Contention� reads, �In contention there is sincerity.� Cheng Yi, one of the best I Ching readers in history, an idealist interpreter under the influence of Taoism and Chan Buddhism, explains this idea simply by saying that �Contention arises because of need.� With customary ambiguity, this remark applies to both predatory and defensive warfare. In its overall symbolism, the hexagram for �Contention� shows internal desire and outward strength. This combination is taken to represent the greedy and aggressive possibilities in human psychology and behavior that lead to contention. Thus the �need� Cheng Yi calls the source from which contention arises may be understood to refer to the internal forces compelling an aggressor as well as the external forces necessitating defense against aggression. In the code of ethics outlined in the I Ching, contention is considered justifiable when it is in resistance to oppression, or in opposition to suffering caused by greed and aggression. This principle is confirmed in all three of the major Ways of Chinese thought, in Confucianism and Taoism as well as in Buddhism. Therefore �contention that is just� also arises because of need. This is the �sincerity in contention� of which the I Ching speaks. Cheng Yi says, �Without sincerity and truthfulness, contention is merely intrigue and leads to misfortune.� This code is also reflected in the practical teachings of The Art of War. In the chapter on �Maneuvering Armies,� Master Sun says,
