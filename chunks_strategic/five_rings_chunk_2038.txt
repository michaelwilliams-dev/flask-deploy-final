"Glaucon responds thatsuch a manmust beamostamazing sophist, butSocrates hastens toassure him that thismaker's power isnothing surprising and iswithin everyone's reach. Socrates tellsGlaucon, "... ifyouarewilling totake amirror andcarry itaround everywhere, quickly youwillmake thesun andthethings intheheaven; quickly, theearth; andquickly, yourself andtheother implements andplants andeverything elsethatwasjust nowmentioned" (596c-e). Thisseems analmost unbelievably crude andinsensitive way todepreciate thevalue ofpoetry's representations. Socrates accuses thepoetofbeing acharlatan whodeceives menand whohasnoclaim towisdom whatsoever. However, acloser examina- tionofthepassages cited willshow thatSocrates' point here issubtler thanimmediately appears. Themanwho carries themirror around will notcatch thereflections ofsome ofthethings which appeared inthe sophist's mirror: noordinary mirror canreflect thegodsandthethings inHades; thesunwould have totake their place. Only thepoetsand thepainters canreproduce thegodsandthe lifeafter death, andthey have nomodels fortheir imitation ofthem intheworks ofother craftsmen orinthevisible universe. Thepoets aretheauthentic, the only, teachers about thegods." Thegreat mystery ishowthey findout about them,howthey areable topresent them tomen. Socratic poetry "The difference between themirror held tonature andtheproduct of theimitative sophist isparallel tothedifference between thelowest level ofthe divided line—where things areseen reflected inwater oronsmooth surfaces —andthewallofthecave—where theprisoners seethereflections ofarti- facts, onlysome ofwhich have natural models. The prisoners' problem is ascending toward truth.Thecause oftheir errors isconnected with thismix- tureofnatural andman-made things. Inthisdiscussion ofpoetry Socrates elaborates thatproblem andreveals theessential character ofthecave. [428 ] Interpretive Essay alsomust tellabout thegodsandtheafterlife. Thisdoesnotconstitute thedifference between theoldpoetry andthenew; thegods arethe center, nottosaytheessence, ofboth.The realquarrel between Soc- ratesandHomer concerns theway inwhich one,finds outabout the gods, ortheview ofthewhole which causes apoet topresent thegods inonewayrather than another. Socrates' criticism ofHomeric poetry isreally astudy oftheprinciples ofhistheogony ortheology, astudy of thenature oftheHomeric gods. Socrates' firststep inhisanalysis ofHomeric wisdom istoattempt toestablish thenature ofapoem.Apoem, heasserts, likeapainting, is aparticular being which hasacurious sortofexistence. Itrepresents other particular beings which arebeings because they, intum,>partake ofasingle, self-subsistent being. Poetry isdependent ontheworld around us; itdoesnotmake itsobjects, and itsstrength comes from the depth ofitsgrasp ofthose objects. Socrates makes thepoint that Homer's book presupposes knowledge ofthebook oftheworld, which Homer does notmake; heisnotcreative andmustbejudged bythat external standard. Poetry isimitation. Now Socrates takes thestrange stepoftesting thepoet's knowledge bycomparing ittotheknowledge oftheartisan whomakes thething imitated. Thisprocedure hasakind of surface plausibility, inthatthepoem doesindeed imitate theobjects ofthevarious arts,andthattheknowledge ofthelatter belongs tothe practitioners ofthose arts.Inthiswaythepoetcomes offverybadly in- deedbecause heissurely notaknower ofallthediverse arts; hisrepre- sentation isonly ashadow ofthecompetent opinions oftheartisans. But allofthis issomehow verywrong. Inthe firstplace, noteverything represented inpoetry isanartifact; indeed, itsmost interesting objects arenotproducts ofart.Second, poetry presents itsobjects intheir in- terrelations, asnoparticular artcando.The specialist inhealth does notassuchknow theproper usesofahealthy body. Poetry isessen- tially comprehensive orsynoptic, andthisdistinguishes itfrom thespe- cial arts.Thepoem isacollection ofimitations, but itisinformed by thevision ofthepoet, avision thattranscends thelevel ofthespecial arts. The further development oftheargument gradually reveals the reasons forthisunusual presentation. Since ithasbeendetermined that theartisans arethestandard ofknowledge, itfollows that ifHomer is tobeauthoritative, hemusthave exercised alloftheartsoratleast the most important ones.Homer, ifhewassoskilled and isanappropriate teacher oftheGreeks, should befamous forhisdeeds aswell ashis speeches.
