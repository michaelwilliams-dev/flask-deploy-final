"It'saneasy-going kind ofchild-bearing forthewomen guard* ians, asyou tell it,"hesaid. "As isfitting," Isaid. "Let's gothrough thenext pointwepro- posed.Wesaid, ofcourse, thattheoffspring mustbebom ofthose in their prime." 1rue. "Doyoushare theopinion that awoman's prime lasts,onthe e ?average, twenty years andaman's thifrty?" "Which years?" hesaid. [139 ] :OCBATES/GLAUCON THEREPUBLIC i60e "AWoman," Isaid,"beginning withhertwentieth year, bearsfor thecityuptoherfortieth; andaman,beginning from thetimewhen he passes hisswiftest prime atrunning, begets forthecityuptohis fifty, fifthyear." 461a "Ofcourse," hesaid, "this istheprime ofbody andprudence for both." "Then, ifamanwho isolder than this,oryounger, engages inre- production forthecommonwealth, weshall saythat it'safault neither holynorjust.Forhebegets forthecityachild that, ifitescapes notice willcome intobeing without being bornunder theprotection ofthe sacrifices andprayers which priestesses, priests, andthewhole city of- feratevery marriage totheeffect thatever better andmore beneficial offspring maycome fromgoodandbeneficial men.

"And thesamelawapplies," Isaid,"when aman stilloftheage tobeget touches awoman ofthatage ifaruler hasnotunited them. We'll sayhe'simposing abastard, anunauthorized andunconsecrated child, onthecity." "Quite right," hesaid. "Now Isuppose thatwhen thewomen andthemen arebeyond theageofprocreation, wewill,ofcourse, leave them free tohave in- c tercourse withwhomsoever they wish, except with adaughter, a mother, thechildren oftheir daughters andtheancestors oftheir mother, and, asforthewomen, except with asonandafather andthe descendants oftheoneandtheancestors oftheother; and allthisonly after theyhavebeen told tobeespecially careful never toleteven a single foetus seethelightofday, ifoneshould beconceived, and, ifone should force itsway, todealwith itontheunderstanding thatthere's to benorearing forsuch achild." "That iscertainly asensible statement," hesaid. "Buthow will d they distinguish oneanother's fathers anddaughters andtheothers you justmentioned?"^'' "Not atall," Isaid. "But ofallthechildren born inthetenth month, andintheseventh, fpom thedayamanbecomes abridegroom, hewill callthemales sonsandthefemales daughters; andthey will call him father; and inthesameway,hewill calltheir offspring grandchil- dren, andthey intheir turn will call hisgroup grandfathers and grandmothers; andthosewhowereborn atthesame time theirmothers andfathers were procreating they will callsisters andbrothers. Thus, as ewewere justsaying, theywon't touch oneanother.
