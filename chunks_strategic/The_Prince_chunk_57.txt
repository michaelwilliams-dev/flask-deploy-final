to guard against flatterers have men tell you the truth � but when is to they tell you the truth, there is risk of being irreverent. So a Prince should cultivate a third way, appointing wise counselors, giving only them the privilege of speaking plainly and telling the truth, and only when asked and not otherwise. But one should inquire with them about everything, and listen to them. Then one should take counsel with oneself. With each of these counselors one should behave in such a way that they know that the more openly they speak the more accepted they are. Don' t listen to anyone else. Follow what they say and don't be up on put off. Whoever does not do this either falls into the hands of flatterers or wobbles among various opinions � which detract from your reputation. I want to bring up one modern example. Luca Rinaldi (a bishop and confidant of Emperor Maximillian of Hapsburg) was he talking of his Majesty and said never took counsel with any.one or did what they said � which went against the advice given above. The Emperor was a secretive man and told no one of his plans nor asked advice of anyone. His plans became known as they were put into effect, whereupon people started to comment and opinionate. The Emperor, easily influenced, would start to to to change his mind. He would start undo what he began do. Since no one could fathom what he wanted to do, no one could base his or her plans on his. THE PRINCE �-121 So , a Prince should consult continuously, only when he wants to , not when the others want to . He has be short with to those who offer counsel when they are not asked , but he has to ask for counsel often . He has to listen patiently to the truth from those he has consulted . Many people deceive themselves who believe that a Prince reputed to be prudent is not really so by nature , but only by virtue of good counsel around him . But it is a general rule that seldom falls : namely, that a Prince who is not himself wise can.not be counseled well , unless he entrust one person alone who is himself prudent . In that case , it could go well , but probably not for long, because such a governor would be likely to take over the state himself. If the Prince relies on more than one person , if he is not himself wise , he will never have a consensus nor know how to unite his counselors . The counselors will each think of their own interest and the Prince won't know how to correct them or whom to trust . A Prince can't expect otherwise because men will always turn out badly unless necessity constrains them to be good . So I conclude that good counsel , no matter where it
