"Andwhat about this?Willyouadmit flutemakers and flutists in- tothecity? Or, isn'ttheflutethemostmany-stringed ofall,and aren't thepanharmonic instruments themselves imitations ofit?" "Plainly," hesaid. "The lyreandthecither areleftyouasuseful forthecity," Isaid. "And, further, forthecountry, there'd beasortofpipe forthe herdsmen." "Atleast soourargument indicates," hesaid. e "It'snothing newwe're doing,myfriend," Isaid, "inchoosing Apollo andApollo's instruments ahead ofMarsyas and hisinstru- ments."'*'' "No,byZeus," hesaid."We don't look tomeasthough we were." "And, bythedog," Isaid,"unawares we've again purged thecity that awhile agowesaidwasluxurious." "That's asignofourmoderation," hesaid. "Come, then," Isaid,"and let'spurge therest.Now, following on harmonic modes would beourruleabout rhythms: wemustn't seek subtle onesnor allsortsoffeet,butwe'll seewhich aretherhythms of anorderly andcourageous life;andwhenwehave seenthem, we'll compel thefootandthetune tofollow thespeech ofsuch aman, rather 400a than thespeech following thefootandthetune. Whatever these rhythms might be isyour job totell, just aswith theharmonic modes."

"That's entirely certain," hesaid. "Mustn't theyoung pursue them everywhere ifthey aretodotheir ownwork?" "Indeed theymust bepursued."
