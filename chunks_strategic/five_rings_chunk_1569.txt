I23 OBSERVANCE OFTHE LAW InMay of1972, chess championBoris Spassky anxiouslyawaited hisrival BobbyFischer inReylqavik,Iceland. The two men had been scheduled to meet fortheWorld Championship ofChess, butFischer had notarrived on time and thematch was onhold. Fischer hadproblems with the sizeofthe prize money, problemswith thewaythemoneywas tobedistributed, problemswith thelogistics ofholding thematch inIceland. Hemight back out atanymoment. Spassky tried tobepatient.HisRussian bosses feltthat Fischer was hu— miliating him and told him towalkaway,butSpasskywanted this match. Heknew hecould destroy Fischer, andnothingwas goingtospoilthe greatest victoryofhis career. “So itseems that allourworkmaycome to nothing,” Spassky told acomrade. “But what can wedo? ItisBobby’s move. Ifhecomes, weplay.Ifhedoes not come; wedonotplay.Aman who iswillingtocommit suicide hastheinitiative.” Fischer finallyarrived inReykjavik,but theproblems,and thethreat ofcancellation, continued. Hedisliked thehall where thematch was tobe fought,hecriticized thelighting,hecomplained about the noise ofthe cameras, he even hated thechairs inwhich heand Spasskywere tosit Now theSoviet Union took theinitiative and threatened towithdraw their man. The bluff apparentlyworked: After alltheweeks ofwaiting, theend- less andinfuriating negotiations, Fischer agreedtoplay. Everyonewas re- lieved, no one more than Spassky.But on the day ofthe ofiicial introductions, Fischer arrivedvery late, and onthedaywhen the“Match oftheCentury”was tobegin,hewas lateagain. This fime, however, the consequenceswould bedire: Ifheshoweduptoolate hewould forfeit the first game. What wasgoingon? Was heplayingsome sort ofmind game? Or wasBobbyFischer perhapsafraid ofBoris Spassky?Itseemed tothe as- sembled grand masters, and toSpassky,that this young kidfrom Brooklyn had aterrible case ofthejitters. At5:09 Fischer showedup,exactlyone minute before thematch was tobecanceled. The firstgame ofachess tournament iscritical, since itsets thetone for themonths tocome. Itisoften aslow andquiet struggle,with thetwoplay- erspreparingthemselves forthe war andtryingtoread each other’s strate- gies.Thisgamewas different. Fischer made aterrible move early on, perhapsthe worst ofhiscareer, and whenSpasskyhad him ontheropes, heseemed togive up.YetSpasskyknew that Fischer nevergave up.Even when facing checkmate, hefought tothebitter end, wearingtheopponent down. This time, though,heseemed resigned.Then suddenlyhebroke out abold move thatputthe room inabuzz. The move shocked Spassky,but herecovered andmanagedtowin thegame.But no one could figureout what Fischer wasupto.Had helostdeliberately? Or was herattled? Unset- tled? Even, assome thought,insane? After hisdefeat inthe firstgame,Fischer complained allthe more loudlyabout theroom, the cameras, andeverythingelse. Healso failed to showupontime forthesecond game. This time theorganizers had had enough: He wasgivenaforfeit. Now he was down twogamestonone,at positionfrom which no one had ever come back towin achess champi- onship.Fischer wasclearly unhinged.Yetinthethirdgame,asallthose who witnessed itremember, hehad aferocious look inhiseye,alook that clearly bothered Spassky. And despitethehole hehaddugforhimself, he seemed supremelyconfident. Hedidmake what appearedtobeanother blunder, ashehad inthefirstgame—but hiscockyairmade Spasskysmell atrap.Yetdespite theRussian’s suspicions,hecould notfigureoutthetrap, and before heknew itFischer had checkmated him. Infact Fischer’s un— orthodox tactics hadcompletelyunnerved hisopponent.Attheend ofthe game,Fischer leaped upand rushed out,yellingtohisconfederates ashe smashed alistinto hispalm, “I’m crushinghim with brute force!” Inthe nextgamesFischer pulledmoves that no one had seen from him before, moves that were nothisstyle.Now Spassky started tomake blunders. After losing thesixth game, hestarted tocry.One grandmaster said, “After this, Spassky’s gottoaskhimself ifit’ssafe togoback toRus- sia." After theeighth game Spasskydecided heknew what washappening: BobbyFischer washypnotizinghim. Hedecided not tolook Fischer inthe eye;helostanyway. After thefourteenth game hecalled astaff conference andannounced, “Anattemptisbeingmade tocontrolmymind.”
