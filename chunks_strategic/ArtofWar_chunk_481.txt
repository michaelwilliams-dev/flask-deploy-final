army is to form a single organic whole, then it follows that the resolution and spirit of its component parts must be of the same quality, or at any rate must not fall below a certain standard. Wellington�s seemingly ungrateful description of his army at Waterloo as "the worst he had ever commanded" meant no more than that it was deficient in this important CHAPTER 12. THE NINE SITUATIONS 103 particular�unity of spirit and courage. Had he not foreseen the Belgian defections and carefully kept those troops in the background, he would almost certainly have lost the day.] 1. How to make the best of both strong and weak�that is a question involving the proper use of ground. [Mei Yao-ch�en�s paraphrase is: "The way to eliminate the differences of strong and weak and to make both serviceable is to utilize accidental fea- tures of the ground." Less reliable troops, if posted in strong positions, will hold out as long as better troops on more exposed terrain. The ad- vantage of position neutralizes the inferiority in stamina and courage. Col. Henderson says: "With all respect to the text books, and to the ordinary tactical teaching, I am inclined to think that the study of ground is often overlooked, and that by no means sufficient importance is attached to the selection of positions. and to the immense advantages that are to be de- rived, whether you are defending or attacking, from the proper utilization of natural features." 2 ] 1. Thus the skillful general conducts his army just as though he were leading a single man, willy-nilly, by the hand. [Tu Mu says: "The simile has reference to the ease with which he does it."] 1. It is the business of a general to be quiet and thus ensure secrecy; upright and just, and thus maintain order. 2. He must be able to mystify his officers and men by false reports and ap- pearances, [Literally, "to deceive their eyes and ears."] and thus keep them in total ignorance. [Ts�ao Kung gives us one of his excellent apophthegms: "The troops must not be allowed to share your schemes in the beginning; they may only rejoice with you over their happy outcome." "To mystify, mislead, and surprise the enemy," is one of the first principles in war, as had been fre- quently pointed out. But how about the other process�the mystification of one�s own men? Those who may think that Sun Tzu is over-emphatic on this point would do well to read Col. Henderson�s remarks on Stone- wall Jackson�s Valley campaign: "The infinite pains," he says, "with which Jackson sought to conceal, even from his most trusted staff officers, his movements, his intentions, and his thoughts, a commander less thorough would have pronounced useless"�etc. etc. 3 In the year 88 A.D., as we read in ch. 47 of the HOU HAN SHU, "Pan Ch�ao took the field 2"The Science of War," p. 333. 3"Stonewall Jackson," vol.
