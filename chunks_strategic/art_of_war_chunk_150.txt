all of the above-mentioned, it is important to be quick. If you are quick, then you can economize on expenditures and allow the people rest. Master Sun Hence, we know that the leader of the army is in charge of the lives of the people and the safety of the nation. CAO CAO If the military leadership is wise, the country is safe. MEI YAOCHEN This tells us how serious the matter of appointing military leaders is. WANG XI The lives of the people and the order of the nation are in the charge of the generals. The difficulty of finding good leadership material is a perennial problem. [ 3 ] Planning a Siege Master Sun The general rule for use of the military is that it is better to keep a nation intact than to destroy it. It is better to keep an army intact than to destroy it, better to keep a division intact than to destroy it, better to keep a battalion intact than to destroy it, better to keep a unit intact than to destroy it. CAO CAO If you raise an army and penetrate deeply into your opponent�s territory, keeping on the move, blocking the space between the inner stronghold and the outer city walls, cutting off communications between inside and outside, then if the opponent surrenders completely, that is best. If you attack destructively and take a nation by force, that is a lesser accomplishment. JIA LIN If you can keep the opponent�s nation intact, then your own nation will also be intact. So this is best. LI QUAN This means that killing is not the important thing. DU YOU It is best if an enemy nation comes and surrenders of its own accord. To attack and defeat it is inferior to this. HO YANXI The best policy is to use strategy, influence, and the trend of events to cause the adversary to submit willingly. ZHANG YU Zhang Yu quoted a statement by Wei Liaozi: �Practicing martial arts, assess your opponents; cause them to lose spirit and direction so that even if the opposing army is intact it is useless�this is winning by the Tao. If you destroy the opposing army and kill the generals, mount the ramparts by shooting, gather a mob and usurp the land, this is winning by force.� Zhang Yu then explained, �So winning by the Tao and winning by force mean the same as keeping a nation intact and destroying a nation. Treating the people mercifully while punishing criminals, gaining complete victory with the country intact, is best.� WANG XI Nation, army, division, battalion, unit�great or small, keep it intact and your dignity will be improved thereby; destroy it, and your dignity will suffer. Master Sun Therefore those who win every battle are not really skillful�those who render others� armies helpless without fighting are the best of all. CAO CAO The best victory is when the opponent surrenders of its own accord before there are any actual hostilities. LI
