"Well, then," I said, "I suppose that if the rulers are to be worthy . of the name, and their auxiliaries likewise, the latter will be willing to .. do what they are commanded and the former to command. In some of '. their commands the rulers will in their tum be obeying the laws; in ' others-all those we leave to their discretion-they will imitate the laws." "It's likely," he said. "Well, then," I said, "you, their lawgiver, just as you selected the men, will hand over the women to them, having selected them in the �. same way too, with natures that are as similar as possible.
