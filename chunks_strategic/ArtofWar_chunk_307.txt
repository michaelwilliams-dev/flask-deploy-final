claims that this is ancient philosophy: �There are sayings on the use of arms: �Let us not be aggressors, but defend.� �Let us not advance an inch, but retreat a foot.�� �Thus when you have fought for the tranquility of the time, then you do not work the masses anymore. Those who do battle wrongly or unmethodically gain small victories by attrition.� The special effects and allocations needed to meet emergencies become ruinous if continued compulsively after the job has been one. The Tao Te Ching says, �Calculated sharpness cannot be kept for long. . . . When one�s work is accomplished honorably, to retire is the natural way.� The victories of the unjust and unmethodical are attained by attrition because they are gained by fighting when honest and innocent people need to be about their business. Master Sun said, �Those who win six out of ten battles go by the stars. Those who win seven out of ten battles go by the sun. Those who win eight of ten battles go by the moon. . . . Those who win ten out of ten battles have skilled commanders yet give rise to calamity � Those who win all the battles can give rise to calamity by draining resources through continued prosecution of warfare; by creating an aggressive momentum, an appetite for conquest; and by falling prey to complacency and carelessness. There is an ancient saying that repeated victory in repeated warfare produces a haughty leadership commanding an exhausted populace, eventually thereby ruining a nation. � There are five things that make for failure; with even one of these five, you won�t win. Thus among ways of war, there are cases where many people are killed but the commanders and troops are not captured, there are cases where commanders and troops are captured but their base camp is not taken, there are cases where a base is taken but the general is not captured, and there are cases where the army is overthrown and the general killed. So, if you find the Way, no one can survive against you.� The ancient text is broken, so it is not clear what is intended here by the �five things that make for failure.� There appears later in the text, however, an extensive list of failures in commanders. The sense of the text that does remain is that there are many grades of victory and defeat, many shades of gray. Part of the art of war is understanding how final the outcome of a particular defeat or victory is, seeing how gains might be lost and how losses might be regained, using this knowledge to plan for security or recovery. Only with comprehensive perspective and fluidly adaptable strategy is it possible to deal unfazed with all sorts of contingencies, even those seeming most desperate.
