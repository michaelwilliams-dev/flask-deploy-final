pro- cedure, inwhich thedefendant proposes hisownpunishment inopposition to theaccuser. The rhetorician plays theaccuser, andthereby shows how his skills canbeofuse (cf.Aristophanes, Clouds). Plato, contrary totheim- pression Aristophanes wishes togive, presents Socrates asinnocent ofjudicial rhetoric; rather itishisopponent whoknows thatpowerful anddangerous art. 32.This isatranslation oftheword kreitton, which means "stronger"; however, itsusewas alsoexpanded tocover allsorts ofsuperiority, and it finally couldmean even goodness orexcellence. Here thesense isclear, but Plato alsoplaysonacertain popular confusion astowhat really constitutes ex- [444 ] Notes /Book I cellence. The firstuseoftheword oecurred at327candprefigur^ THrasym^- chus'argument thatthestronger should ruleandarethestandards forjustice. 33.Pancration wasacombination ofwrestling andboxing. 34.Inmodem times theword sycophant hascome tomean onlya"flat- terer," especially ofthesortwhosurround kingsandtyrants. Thismeaning is notentirely alien totheGreek sense, but itisatacertain remove from the primary meaning. Thesycophants weremenwhomade accusations against Athenian citizens, acting, asitwere, aspublic prosecutors. Theywere black- mailers; anycharge theymightmake could cause difficulty and, attheleast, would beexpensive. They distorted themeaning ofmen's actsandstatements, andSocrates, accused ofmaking theworse argument appear thebetter, could becompared tothem.Hewastrying tocause trouble andmake hisin- terlocutors lookbadbefore thepublic. Thesycophants were flatterers ofthe tyrant public opinion, since theircharges usually hadtodowith alleged crimes against civil society, andsince thejuries were chosen bylotfrom thecitizen body atlarge. 35.This isanother legalterm inascene that isasortofnriock accusation ofSocrates. Theword implies anycrime ofmalicious damage orfraud. 36.Thetermused isponeros, onewhich hasstrong moral overtones, implying something worthless orvicious. The exact translation would be "villainous," andtheword hasprecisely thesame history astheEnglish word villain—originally itrefers tosomeone whoworks. Theuseoftheterm inthis context prepares foratechnical orscientific treatment ofvirtue andvice. Just asthebody's vice iscorrected bytheartofmedicine, thesoul's vice iscor- rected bytheartofpolitics. Thewordwastranslated as"bad" inthediscus- sion at334c-e. 37.TheGreek word ispleonexia, which means "greed," "grasping," or "overreaching," but isderived from thewords meaning "tohavemore" or"to getmore." Thissense isplayed upon inwhat follows, and itshould beremem- bered that"togetthebetter" isanidiomatic English rendering, andthatthe Greek is"more" rather than "better" (of.349e). 38."Kidnappers" heremeans thosewhocapture menand sellthem into slavery. "Housebreakers" arethosewhobreak through themud orplaster walls oftheAthenian homes inorder toenter. 39.Anattendant inthepublic bathhouses whobrought water andsoap andperformed some oftheoffices ofabarber. These were proverbially vulgar menandgreat talkers. 40.This expression refers tothewayanurse feeds abalky childbyput- tingfood into itsmouth. Thrasymachus becomes thenurse Socrates needs (cf. 343a). 41.TheGreek word isidionwhich initssimplest sensemeans "private" asopposed topublic orcommon (cf.333a, note 23). Itcanalsomean theindi- vidual, asopposed tothegeneral, orthepeculiar character ofathing.Theop- position between private andpublic isanimportant theme intheRepublic and, insome respects, itisthecore oftheproblem ofjustice. The private is usually ofdistinctly lower status thanthepublic; butthere areoccasions when [445 ] THEREPUBLlGi^ theprivate, asopposed tothepolitical, istreated assuperior ormore impor- tant, forexample, when thecity isnotthebestpossible andcertain individuals canbemore fullyhuman inopposition toit.Itismost important tonote this word inacontext inwhich theartsarecompared toacommimity ofmen. In almost allcases idion willbetranslated as"private," 42.Cf.338c, note 32. 43.Theword used— dikastai—istheoneused formembers ofthe Athenian juries. This isanother reference tothemock trialofSocrates. Here Socrates suggests another form ofrhetoric thatwould assure histriumph over hisaccuser anddoaway with hisdependence onpopular judgment. 44.TheGreek word forinnocence, euetheia, iscomposed fromwords meaning "good habits"; theword forcorruption, kakoetheia, iscomposed fromwords meaning "bad habits." Hence Socrates' transition here isvery direct, ifnotentirely obvious. 45.Cf.327aandnote 5.
