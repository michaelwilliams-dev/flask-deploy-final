by anger due to ill-temper-pursuing satisfaction of honor, victory, and anger without calculation and in? telligence?" "Concerning this part, too," he said, "such things are necessary." "What then?" I said. "Shall we be bold and say this: Of the desires concerned with the love. of gain and the love of victory, some-followers of knowledge and argument-pursue in company with them the pleasures to which the prudential part leads and take only these; such desires will take the truest pleasures, so far as they can take true ones-because they follow truth-and those that are most their own-if indeed what is best for each thing is also most properly its own?" "But, of course," he said, "that is what is most its own." "Therefore, when all the soul follows the philosophic and is not factious, the result is that each part may, so far as other things are con? cerned, mind its own business and be just and, in particular, enjoy its own pleasures, the best pleasures, and, to the greatest possible extent, the truest pleasures." 587 � �"That's entirely certain." "And, therefore, when one of the other parts gets control, the result is that it can't discover its own pleasure and compels the others to pursue an alien and untrue pleasure." "That's so," he said. "Doesn't what is most distant from philosophy and argument pro? duce such results?" "By far." "And is what is most distant from law and order most distant from argument?" "Plainly." "And didn't the erotic and tyrannic desires come to light as most distant?'' l "By far." "And the kingly and orderly ones least distant?'' "Yes.,, "Then I suppose the tyrant will be most distant from a pleasure that is true and is properly his own, while the king is least distant." "Necessarily." "And therefore," I said, "the tyrant will live most unpleasantly and the king most pleasantly." "Quite necessarily." "Do you know," I said, "how much more unpleasant the tyrant's life is than the ing's?'' 587 b C "I will, if you tell me," he said. "There are, as it seems, three pleasures-one genuine, and two bastard. The tyrant, going out beyond the bastard ones, once he has fled law and argument, dwells with a bodyguard of certain slave pleasures; and the extent of his inferiority isn't at all easy to tell, except perhaps as follows." "How?'' he said. "The tyrant, of course, stood third from the oligarchic man; the man of the people was between them." "Yes.,, "Then wouldn't he dwell with a phantom of pleasure that with respect to truth is third from that other, if what went before is true?" "That's so." "And the oligarchic mari is in his tum third from the kingly man, d if we count the aristocratic and the kingly man as the same." "Yes, he is third." "Therefore," I said, "a tyrant is removed from true pleasure by a number that is three times three." "It looks like it." "Therefore," I said, "the phantom of tyrannic pleasure would,
