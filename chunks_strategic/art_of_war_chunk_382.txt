it is doubtless connected with the movement of thought preparing the comparison between the bushi and the carpenter. During the Tensho era (1573�1592), in institutionalizing the existing social hierarchy, Toyotomi Hideyoshi established four feudal classes or orders. This system was reinforced by the Tokugawa regime. Its principal aim was to guarantee the power of the governing class of warriors, which henceforth possessed a monopoly on weapons and benefited from various privileges. Above them, but without effective power, were the nobles who surrounded the emperor. Below these four classes, two other classes existed: eta and himin, which were considered nonhuman. The eta performed various impure manual tasks, notably work with animal skins. The himin were beggars and at the same time did work connected with the transport and cleaning of corpses. The feudal classes were abolished in the Meiji era, but they were replaced by new social classes: kazoku (new nobles), shizoku (former warriors), and heimin (ordinary people). This social classification was abolished by the constitution after the Second World War. But the problem of the eta and the himin was not resolved in a satisfactory manner. Today tenacious social discrimination against the former eta and himin still exists, even though these classes no longer exist from a legislative point of view. �For traversing human life,� hito no yo o wataru koto: To evoke the situation of human life, Musashi uses the image of a ship crossing. He uses this image again in the Scroll of Fire. 20. Toku is most often translated as �virtue� (see �Toku� in the appendix), but it also has the sense of �richness.� In this passage, toku seems to draw on this second set of meanings and indicate the particular qualities, the richness, hidden in each weapon. 21. �Black cords,� sumigane: sumi, �ink�; gane or kane, �ruler.� 22. �Noble house,� kuge: ku, �the emperor�s court�; ge, �house.� This refers to the social system of vassalage. �Warrior house,� buke: bu, �military person,� ke, the same meaning as ge. In order to understand Musashi�s comparison, it should be explained that in Japanese, the same term refers both to the house as a building and to the family that occupies it. The corresponding ideogram is pronounced ie when it is alone and ke or ge when it is combined with another word. For Japanese thought this is not merely a verbal matter but also expresses the profound sense of identity that exists among members of a family and also solidarity among members of a family down through successive generations, both of these being given material expression in the sheltering form of the house. This notion can be expanded to the level of the clan, which is conceived of as a large family, and can then extend beyond that to the solidarity among clans composing the social class of warriors. Another extension of the term allows it to designate a school of a traditional art; for here, too, the mode of transmission of the school was based mainly on the
