condemna? tion and those who had voted for acquittal. To the former he $peaks di? rectly and in their own terms. They assume that death is the worst thing; and so he threatens them; they will suffer for what they have done, and suffer what they most fear. Their anger will not protect them; Socrates' death will precipitate the worst rather than fend it off. To those who voted for acquittal he tells consoling myths to the effect that death is not to be feared. They are gentle men. Although they did not under? stand him, they were favorably disposed to him. He strengthens that gentleness within them by weakening the fears which would cause them to hate the cosmopolitanism of the accused man. Thus, imitating the function of tragedy, Socrates attempts to purge them of the pity and fear which can lead to fanaticism and enables them to share something of his own calm without knowing its source. The myths he tells the jurors who believed him to be innocent are akin to those he wants the poets to tell the warriors, who are potential jurors. Achilles and Soc? rates are both superior to the many, in particular in their mastery over death. But the difference between the mad Achilles and the Socrates whose death is depicted in the Phaedo is the measure of the difference between the two sources of that mastery. Socrates' death and the mysterious power it reveals are the new model of the heroic and must replace the Achillean one. To understand the meaning and uses of music, as Socrates taught them, it is most helpful to tum to Shakespeare who reflected that teach? ing in Lorenzo's great speech to Jessica in The Merchant of Venice, Act V. This scene takes place at the end of a dark, unhappy play theï¿½ theme of which was the struggle between Shylock and Antonio, each defending his own to the detriment of the other. Only here, in Belmont, is there harmony and beauty. In this utopia, love reigns. The discussion of music explains the possibility of that love and beauty. There is a cos? mic harmony, music and love in the universe. Earthly music is the audible imitation of the inaudible music of the spheres. These heard harmonies have a mathematical structure which is akin to the math? ematical principles at the base of the whole. Of all the arts, music is the one which most directly represents to the senses the intelligible or? der of things. We forget that cosmic music because we are "grossly closed in by a muddy vesture of decay." Our mortality leads us to be full of rage; earthly music ministers to that rage, calms us and makes us gentle. It reminds us, in all our separateness and opposition, of the dom? inance of harmony in our universe. Socrates' musical education of the warriors gives their passions that music without which a man, ac? cording to Lorenzo, cannot be trusted. (392cc-403c) If poetry
