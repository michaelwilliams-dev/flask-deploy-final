The words peopleuse topersuadeusvirtu- allyinvite ustoreflect onthem with words ofour own; wemull them over, and often end upbelieving theopposite ofwhat they say.(That ispart of ourperverse nature.) Italsohappensthat words offend us,stirring upasso- ciations unintended bythespeaker. The visual, ontheother hand, short-circuits thelabyrinth ofwords. It strikes with anemotional powerandimmediacythat leave nogapsfor re- flecfion and doubt. Like music, itleaps rightover rational, reasonable droughts. Imagine theMoon Doctor tryingtomake acase forhismedical practice, tryingtoconvince theunconverted bytellingthem about the healing powers ofthemoon, and about hisownspecialconnection toadis- tantobject inthesky.Fortunately forhim, hewas able tocreate acom- pelling spectaclethat made words unnecessary. The moment hispatients entered thebeer hall, theimage ofthe moon spoke eloquently enough. Understand: Words putyouonthedefensive. Ifyouhave toexplain yourself your powerisalreadyinquestion. Theimage,ontheother hand, imposes itself asagiven. Itdiscourages questions,creates forceful associa- tions, resists unintended interpretations,communicates instantly,and forges bonds that transcend social dilferences.

Before theRenaissance, ithasbeen an gued, sightand theother senses--taste, touch, and soon-—-operatedon a relatively equal plane. Since then, however, thevisual has come todomi- nate theothers, and isthe sense wemostdependonand trust. AsGracién said, “The truth isgenerally seen, rarely heard.” When theRenaissance painterFraFilippo Lippiwas acapturedslave among theMoors, hewon hisfreedom bysketchingadrawing ofhismaster on awhite wall with a piece ofcharcoal; when the owner saw thedrawing, heinstantlyunder- stood thepowerofaman who could make such images, and letFraLippi go.That oneimagewas far more powerfulthananyargumenttheartist could have made with words. Never neglect theway you arrange things visually. Factors likecolor, forexample,have enormous symbolicresonance. When the con artist Yel- low Kid Weil created anewsletter touting thephonystocks hewas ped- dling, hecalled itthe “Red Letter Newsletter” and had itprinted,at considerable expense, inredink. The color created asense ofurgency, power,andgoodfortune. Weil recognized details like these askeystode- ception—asdomodern advertisers and mass-marketers.
