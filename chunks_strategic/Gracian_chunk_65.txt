of himself in public will not be regarded as discreet in private life. One may lose more on a day of pleasure than has been gained during a whole life of labour. Still you must not always keep away: to be singular is to condemn all others. Still less act the prude--leave that to its appropriate sex: even religious prudery is ridiculous. Nothing so becomes a man as to be a man: a woman may a.ect a manly bearing as an excellence, but not vice versa. Know how to renew your Character, with the help both of Nature and of Art, Every seven years the disposition changes, they say. Let it be a change for the better and for the nobler in your taste. After the �rst seven comes reason, with each succeeding lustre let a new excellence be added. Observe this change so as to aid it, and hope also for betterment in others. Hence it arises that many change their behaviour when they change their position or their occupation. At times the change is not noticed till it reaches the height of maturity. At twenty Man is a Peacock, at thirty a Lion, at forty a Camel, at �fty a Serpent, at sixty a Dog, at seventy an Ape, at eighty nothing at all. Display yourself. 'Tis the illumination of talents: for each there comes an appropriate moment; use it, for not every day comes a triumph.

Even excellence depends on circumstances and is not always opportune. Ostentation is out of place when it is out of time. More than any other quality it should be free of any a.ectation. This is its rock of o.ence, for it then borders on vanity and so on contempt: it must be moderate to avoid being vulgar, and any excess is despised by the wise. At times it consists in a sort of mute eloquence, a careless display of excellence, for a wise concealment is often the most e.ective boast, since the very withdrawal from view piques curiosity to the highest. 'Tis a �ne subtlety too not to display one's excellence all at one time, but to grant stolen glances at it, more and more as time goes on. Each exploit should be the pledge of a greater, and applause at the �rst should only die away in expectation of its sequel. cclxxviii Avoid Notoriety in all Things. Even excellences
