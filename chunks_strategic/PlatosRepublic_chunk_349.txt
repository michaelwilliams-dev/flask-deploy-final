Women's favor can be won by gifts, and they have a taste for adornment and public display. Women play a great role in the corruption of regimes, as wi1l be shown in Books VJJJ and JX. If half the city is not educatedï¿½ to the city's virtues, the city will not subsist. This is a city without homes, and the women have more to overcome if they are to accept it, for their natures lead them to love the private things most and draw the men to a simi]ar love. They must share the men's tastes, or they will resist the changes in the family Socrates is about to propose. Jn the second place, the exdusive maleness, so much connected with batt]e, is not the who]e of human nature, although it may appear so to the men. The female represents gentleness, and the complete soul must embrace both principles. Pheidippides, in the Clouds, and Calli? cles, in the Gorgias, think of Socrates as unmanly, a pale-faced individ? ual who sits around and gossips rather than engaging in the activities of real men. In the Theaetetus Socrates compares himself to a kind of woman, a midwife; and in the Symposium he recounts that he learned the secrets of his erotic science from a woman. Just as a city needs the female, so does the soul, but perhaps in a more fundamental way. Full humanity is a discrete mixture of masculinity and femininity. When talking about warrior-guardians the feminine could be forgotten; but this latest discussion is a harbinger of the philosopher-guardians. Having successfully met the first wave-the same education and way of life for women as for men, Socrates and Glaucon prepare to face the second_:._the community of women and children. In the discussion of this proposal there is less emphasis on the comic element; the prob? lems touched on here have been themes of tragedy-Antigone and Oedipus come most immediately to mind-as well as comedy. Socrates and Glaucon agree to postpone the question of the possibility of this institution-that is, according to the procedure they have adopted, the question of whether it is natural-in favor of first describing it and its advantages. The sexual relations of the guardian and auxiliary classes are treated as though they exist only for the production of children for the city. An attempt is made to rationalize sexual desire in making it responsive to the command of the law. Attraction and love in them? selves know no limits of propriety, exigency, law or country. They are most dangerous to a city because their power is such as to drown all other sentiments in their intensity, and they indicate an element of man which is by nature unpolitical. The sexual passion can be trained and repressed, but it is not usually thought possible to make it respond only to those objects chosen by the city, in a way and at a time deemed fitting by the city. But here Socrates acts as though it were feasible,
