and hiscompanions canbegin acritical examination oftheancestral code, oftheconven- tional view ofjustice. This istheburden oftherestofBook I.Alltradi- tional opinions arediscredited; andunaided reason, freeoflimiting prejudices, canbegin thesearch foranunderstanding ofjustice which isnotmerely opinion. This criticism isadestructive activity inthe name ofliberation. Itisaperilous undertaking formenwhomust re- mainmembers ofcivil society andcould notproperly takeplace under theeyes ofCephalus. Hestands forthose restraints onbodyandsoul which areessential tothepreservation ofthecity.There arecertain un- comfortable issues, theraising ofwhich usually indicates aninclination toviceonthepartofthosewhodoso.Thepractice ofposing theex- treme questions isabadone, foroneofitsnecessary consequences is corruption ofthehabits ofthevirtues. Theonly justification forques- [312 ] Interpretive Essay tioning theoldwaywould bethat asaresult anew, superior, way which Cephalus doesnotknow ofmight emerge. Theancestral isbyits nature silent about itsownfoundations; itisanimposing presence that awes thosewhomight betempted tolooktooclosely. Cephalus typifies theancestral which cannot, butmust, beques- tioned. Although hisappearance isbrief, bymeans ofafew cir- cumspect inquiries Socrates manages toreveal hischaracter and his principles and,hence, those ofthetradition herepresents. Then theold man isdelicately setaside.He isafather inthefullest senseâ€” hewas once very erotic andhepossesses aconsiderable store ofmoney. He presents himself asalover ofspeeches, andthereby afriend ofSoc- rates. Butheloves speeches only inhisoldage,and itisdoubtful whether heconsiders that hisprime. Thepassions ofyouth ledhimto bodily pleasures, and itisonlywith thebody's decline thatheturns to thethings ofthesoul.ForCephalus, speeches areawayofspending his oldage, forSocrates they constitute thehighest human activity. Ceph- alus' youthful passions, however appealing, seem tohave ledhiminto activities that arecontrary tojustice, and hisoldage isspent wor- rying about themandatoning forthem. Thus, from thepoint ofview of justice, eros isaterrible thing, asavage beast. Foraman likeCephalus, life isalways splitbetween sinning andrepenting. Onlybythedeath of erosand itscharms cansuch agentleman become fully reliable, forhis eros leads neither tojustice norphilosophy buttointense, private bodily satisfaction. Cephalus says that itischaracter, anattribute ofthesoul,which enables himtobecontented inoldage.Socrates poses arather crude question: doesn't money help? Aren't thethings withwhich Cephalus is concerned really tiedtomoney? Isn'ttheinsistence oncharacter merely awayofhiding thefactofdependence onmoney andofattributing one's happiness tooneself rather than tothetruematerial source of one's wellbeing? Must nottheoverriding concern ofprivate men, families and citiesbetheacquisition ofwherewithal? Theanswer isyes andno.Cephalus would bevery different andmuch lesshappy without money; heisnotlikeSocrates who ispoorandneeds nothing more. But Cephalus isnotasimple money-maker. Money isnecessary, but itfrees him forthefulfillment ofcertain family and religious duties which sublimate his life.Heinherits themoney andwhatever improprieties werecommitted inthe firstmaking ofitarelostinthemists oftime. It would beunseemly, andlead toanundu~e concentration onmoney if onewere toinsist toomuch onitsimportance. Characteristic ofCeph- alusandmen likehim isasalutary forgetting ofthepreconditions of their kind oflife. Thegreatest goodCephalus hasenjoyed frommoney istheavoid- [313 ] THEREPUBLIC ance ofinjustice andimpiety. Here forthe firsttimewetouch onthe subject which istobecome thetheme oftheRepublic. Thequestionof money seems toleadhim tothequestion ofjustice. Theoldman is afraid ofpunishment after death, sohedoesnotwant todepart owing debts tomen orsacrifices togods, orhaving cheated ordeceived anyone. With hismoney hecanpayhisdebts andoffer hissacrifices andbecause hepossesses money heisnotsodependent onothers that heneed deceive inorder tostay alive.The tales toldbythepoets about punishments inanother world forinjustices committed inthisonecon- cerned Cephalus littlewhen hewasyounger. Hewasinclined tolaugh them off;accordingly, heworried little about injustices hemight be committing. Only asdeath anddeath's perspective approaches does fear causehimtobecome concerned about hisduties tomenandgods.He is notsure thatthere aresuchpunishments oreven thathehad really done unjust deeds, butprudence counsels apunctilious attention tohis accounts withmenandgods. Justice isamatter ofself-interest: one should careabout others ifthere aregodswhodefend justice.
