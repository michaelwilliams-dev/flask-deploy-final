hadtobegoodmenand know it.Butfrom thissimple admission follows aconsequence which isintolerable toPolemarchus: totheextent thatthejustman erred about thegoodness ofmen,hewould benefit badmenandharmgood onesandhence beunjust.Asimple reformulation solves theproblem: firiends areproperly thosewhoappear tobegoodand are. But this little change, ifitwere taken seriously, would have the profoundest ofeffects onPolemarchus' life.His firstadmission that his friends were thosewhoseemed tohimgood reflected thewayhereally thinks. Itisaneasygoing outlook, typical ofmostmen.Heknows who friends are.Ourfriends arethose around us,andtheinsistence that theymust begood isasecondary consideration, one thathasan abstract ringtoit.Thiscondition isadmitted inspeech buthaslittle ef- fectindeed.And thismeans thatmenwho loyally serve their friends areconstantly andthoughtlessly doing injustice. Thisconsequence can- notbeavoided simply bymaking more effort, forPolemarchus' view is notmerely aresult ofhislaziness butaproduct ofhisattachment to family and city.Hemakes theprimitive identification ofthegoodwith hisown.He islikehisfatherwhowanted Socrates asafriend and in- [323 ] THEREPUBLIC vitedhim tobecome amember o£thefamily. Menwho areoutsiders canbecome friends onlybybecoming "naturalized" members ofthe family; blood tiesarewhat count. Even theloyalty tothecity isunder- stood asanextension ofthefamily. Thistendency toseethegood in one'sownandtodevote oneself toitisoneofthemost powerful urges ofhuman nature andthesource ofgreat devotion andenergy. Once the distinction between what isgoodandone'sown ismade, theprinciple ofloyalty tofamily and city isundermined. Inorder tobejust,one must seekgoodmenwherever theymay be,even innations fighting one'sown nation. Ifthegoodmustbepursued, then caring forone's ownmustbeextinguished, oritwillmake oneunjust andimpede the quest forthegood. Thisundermines family and city;andtheymust at- tempt toprevent thedistinction fromevencoming tolight. Certainly, Polemarchus would regard theabandonment ofhisprimary loyalties as thedestruction ofthepurpose anddignity ofhislife. If,however, heis tobeconsistent with theargument, hemustmake this sacrifice. Aman whowishes tobejustmustbecosmopolitan. Thus far,Socrates hasledustotheobservation that inorder todo good tofriends andharm toenemies oneneed onlybeaphilosopher andgivejip_ongj^ttachm£Qts tothosg_^^iQm-tnQsLnign call_friends. NowTie attacks theentire view implied bythedefinition. Heasserts thatnojustmanwould harm anyone, thereby opposing hisown un- derstanding ofjustice tothatofthegentleman. His isanutterly un- political view, onethatseems todeny thedistinction between friend andenemy. Ittakes noaccount ofthedesire toavenge insults andap- pears tobepredicated onthenotion that life isnotessentially com- petitive. Socrates does notsuggest thatthejustmanwould want to benefit allmen, only thathewould want tobenefit hisfriends and re- main indifferent totheothers. Polemarchus believes that itisimpossible tobenefit friends without harming enemies, forevery city isincompeti- tionwith other cities forthepossession ofscarce things. There cannot becities without enemies, and aman cannot beagood citizen without wishing illtohiscity's enemies. Onecanbeindifferent toene- mies ifonedivorces oneself from thecity's perspective and ifthethings oneconsiders good arenotthreatened orscarce. Only thethings ofthe mind aresuch astobelong toallmenwithout neciessary exclusion of somemenandthewarconsequent onthatexclusion. Nobody need take aman's knowledge fromhim inorder toenjoy itasonewould have to doinorder tomake useofhismoney. Socrates' view isthatofphiloso- phy, inwhich knowledge isthehighest good; Polemarchus' view isthat ofthecity, inwhich property isthehighest, atleast themost needful, good. ^ I324 ] I IInterpretive Essay Intheconcluding portion oftheir discussion, Socrates and Polemarchus actually have entirely diiferent understandings ofwhat it means toharm someone. Socrates saysthattoharm istomake aperson orthing worse, with respect tohisoritsspecific virtue. Justice, he asserts without proof, ishuman virtue, sotoharmsomeone would beto makehimmore unjust. Correcting hisearlier statement thattheartsare simply neutral, Socrates further asserts thatthepractitioners ofartsare dedicated togoals which they cannot, totheextent they aretrue to their arts, ignore. Therefore thejustman cannot byjustice make another manmore unjust, andthuscannot harm him.Now Polemar- chushadnosuchnotion inmindwhen hespoke ofharming enemies. What hemeant wastaking theenemy's property orlife,forthose are thegood things. Socrates' view isperfectly consistent with stealing from orkilling anenemy justsolong asheisnotmademore unjust. Soc- ratesandPolemarchus differ about what istruly good.
