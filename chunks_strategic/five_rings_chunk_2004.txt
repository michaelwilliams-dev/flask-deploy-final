diverse parts. According to the firstpart, allthemembers ofthecity,andparticularly thewarriors, werebomfrom theearthandeducated andequipped prior toemerging from it.Ifthecitizens believe thetale,they willhave ablood tietothe country; their relationship toitwillhave thesameimmediacy asdoes their relationship tothefamily. Loyalty toaparticular cityalways seems somehow questionable: why affection forthesemen rather than anyorallothers? The talemakes them brothers andrelates them tothis particular patch ofland. Itidentifies cityandregime with country, which istheobject ofthemost primitive political loyalty; itgives the motherland lifeandtheprinciples of^he citybody. Short ofauniversal state, nothing butsuch atalecanmake anatural connection ofthein- dividual tooneofthemany existing cities. Moreover, inthisway, the [365 ] THEREPUBLIC regime itself islentthecolor ofnaturalness. The factthatregimes re- quirehuman institution, asother natural things donot, calls their naturalness intoquestion. Butherethevery functions which theregime haseducated thecitizens tofulfill areattributed tonature; thecitizens grow into their political roles asacorns grow into oaks.Each might havewondered whyheshould bedevoted tohisparticular specialty to theexclusion ofallothers; butnowtheyseethattheequipment oftheir artsbelongs tothem inthesameway their bodies do.Thisregime isal- sovulnerable because itconquered orstole theland inwhich itis established; thisimperfect beginning gives ground forlatermen to argue theright ofthestronger intheirown interest. This taleprovides forthat eventuality byconcealing theunjust origin ofthisregime (which wehave seen)byajustaccount ofitsorigin.Onthebasis ofthe lie,thecitizens caninallgood faithandconscience takepride inthe justice oftheir regime, andmalcontents have noJustification for rebellion. Such aretheadvantages ofautochthony. Thesecond partofthe liegives divine sanction tothenatural hierarchy ofhuman talents andvirtues while enabling theregime to combine the political advantages ofthishierarchy with those of mobility. IntheSocratic view, political justice requires thatunequal men receive unequal honors andunequal shares inruling. This isboth advantageous and fitting. Inorder tobeeffective andbepreserved, the inequality ofrightanddutymust receive institutional expression. But, inpractice, ifinequality isanaccepted principle itfinds itsexpression inafixed class towhich onebelongs asaresult ofbirth and/or wealth, rather than virtue. Where there isnosuch class, equality istheprinci- plethatdominates; and, ifinanegalitarian society there arehierar- chies, they arebased onstandards likewealth ortechnical skill.The problem istoestablish aregime inwhich thehierarchy established by lawreflects thenatural one,orin.which virtue istheonly title tomem- bership intheruling class. Allunjust conventional inequalities mustbe overcome without abandoning therespect fortheinequality constituted bydifferences invirtue. The difficulty, ofcourse, stems from private interest andproperty. Themore powerful always want tohavemore, andtheweaker arewilling tosettle forequality. Inorder todemote the ruler, hisspecial privileges andproperty mustbetaken fromhim;such changes meet thestrongest resistance. Fathers arenotinclined tosee their sonsdeprived oftheir birthright. And itisnoteasy tomakemen without virtues seeandaccept their inferiority andgiveuphopes ofris- ing.Reason andsentiment demand asolution bymeans ofwhichmen getwhat they deserve. But inallactual regimes there areoneoftwo practical solutions: there isahierarchy, butonethatmixes nature with [366] Interpretive Essay convention bymaking ruling depend onsomemore easily recognized andaccepted titlethan virtue; orthere isnostandard orhierarchy at all.Each solution reflects apartofthetruth, buteach isincomplete. The lieprovides abasis forasatisfactory solution, giving thehierarchy solidity while atthesame time presenting men with arationale designed toovercome their primitive inclination tovalue themselves at least ashighly astheir neighbors. The lieaccomplishes thisbyin- troducing agodwhofashions thecitizens, andwho attheir birthmixes various metals intothem toindicate their various valuesâ€” gold for rulers, silver forwarriors, andbronze and iron forartisans. Ifthe citizens believe this,and ifthecitizens alsoaccept thenotion thatthere aremeans ofseeing thevarious metals, they willhave atleastsome counterpoise totheir self-love. The lieimplies thatthecitymusthave some wise rulerwhocandistinguish thequalities ofsouls, buthere that isnotunderlined, andtheemphasis isonpreparing thecitizens toac- ceptboth astability andamovement which goagainst their grain.The firstpartofthe liediffers from thesecond inthattheformer attempts tomake theconventional attachment tothecityand itsregime seem
