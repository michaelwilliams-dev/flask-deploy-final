Part oftheproblem you face, then, isthatpeoplewon’t tellyoualltheir thoughts, emotions, andplans. Controllingwhat they say,theyoften keep themost critical parts oftheir character hidden—their weaknesses, ulterior motives, obsessions.

The French politician Talleyrandwas one ofthegreatest practitioners ofthis art.Hehad anuncanny abilitytoworm secrets outofpeopleinpa- liteconversation. Acontemporary ofhis, Baron deVitrolles, wrote, “Wit andgracemarked hisconversation. Hepossessed theartofconcealinghis thoughtsorhismalice beneath atransparentveil ofinsinuations, words thatimply somethingmore than they express.
