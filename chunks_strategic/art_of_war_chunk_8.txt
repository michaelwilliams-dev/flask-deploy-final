in the time of the earlier historian and were purposely ignored by him.15 12The passage I have put in brackets is omitted in the T�U SHU, and may be an interpolation. It was known, however to Chang Shou-chieh of the T�ang dynasty, and appears in the T�AI P�ING YU LAN. 13Ts�ao Kung seems to be thinking of the first part of chap. II, perhaps especially of ss. 8. 14See chap. XI. 15On the other hand, it is noteworthy that WU TZU, which is not in 6 chapters, has 48 assigned to it in the HAN CHIH. Likewise, the CHUNG YUNG is credited with 49 chapters, though now only in one only. In CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 10 Tu Mu�s conjecture seems to be based on a passage which states: "Wei Wu Ti strung together Sun Wu�s Art of War," which in turn may have resulted from a misun- derstanding of the final words of Ts�ao King�s preface. This, as Sun Hsing-yen points out, is only a modest way of saying that he made an explanatory paraphrase, or in other words, wrote a commentary on it. On the whole, this theory has met with very little acceptance. Thus, the SSU K�U CH�UAN SHU says: "The mention of the 13 chapters in the SHIH CHI shows that they were in existence before the HAN CHIH, and that latter accretions are not to be considered part of the original work. Tu Mu�s assertion can certainly not be taken as proof." There is every reason to suppose, then, that the 13 chapters existed in the time of Ssu-ma Ch�ien practically as we have them now. That the work was then well known he tells us in so many words. "Sun Tzu�s 13 Chapters and Wu Ch�i�s Art of War are the two books that people commonly refer to on the subject of military matters. Both of them are widely distributed, so I will not discuss them here." But as we go further back, serious difficulties begin to arise. The salient fact which has to be faced is that the TSO CHUAN, the greatest contemporary record, makes no mention whatsoever of Sun Wu, either as a general or as a writer. It is natural, in view of this awkward circumstance, that many scholars should not only cast doubt on the story of Sun Wu as given in the SHIH CHI, but even show themselves frankly skeptical as to the existence of the man at all. The most powerful presentment of this side of the case is to be found in the following disposition by Yeh Shui-hsin:16 It is stated in Ssu-ma Ch�ien�s history that Sun Wu was a native of the Ch�i State, and employed by Wu; and that in the reign of Ho Lu he crushed Ch�u, entered Ying, and was a great general. But in Tso�s Commentary no Sun Wu appears at all. It is true that Tso�s Commentary need not contain absolutely everything that other histories contain. But Tso has not omitted to
