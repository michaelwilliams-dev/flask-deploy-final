envoy and thirty of his suite. The remainder, more than a hundred in all, perished in the flames. On the following day, Pan Ch�ao, divining his thoughts, said with uplifted hand: �Although you did not go with us last night, I should not think, Sir, of taking sole credit for our exploit.� This satisfied Kuo Hsun, and Pan Ch�ao, having sent for Kuang, King of Shan-shan, showed him the head of the barbarian envoy. The whole kingdom was seized with fear and trembling, which Pan Ch�ao took steps to allay by issuing a public proclamation. Then, taking the king�s sons as hostage, he returned to make his report to Tou Ku." HOU HAN SHU, ch. 47, ff. 1, 2.] ] the second is to burn stores; [Tu Mu says: "Provisions, fuel and fodder." In order to subdue the rebel- lious population of Kiangnan, Kao Keng recommended Wen Ti of the Sui dynasty to make periodical raids and burn their stores of grain, a policy which in the long run proved entirely successful.] the third is to burn baggage trains; [An example given is the destruction of Yuan Shao�s wagons and impedi- menta by Ts�ao Ts�ao in 200 A.D.] the fourth is to burn arsenals and magazines; [Tu Mu says that the things contained in "arsenals" and "magazines" are the same. He specifies weapons and other implements, bullion and cloth- ing. Cf. VII. ss. 11.] the fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy.

The method by which this may be done is to set the tips of arrows alight by dipping them into a brazier, and then shoot them from powerful crossbows into the enemy�s lines."] 2. In order to carry out an attack, we must have means available. [T�sao Kung thinks that "traitors in the enemy�s camp" are referred to. But Ch�en Hao is more likely to be right in saying: "We must have favorable circumstances in general, not merely traitors to help us." Chia Lin says: "We must avail ourselves of wind and dry weather."] the material for raising fire should always be kept in readiness. [Tu Mu suggests as material for making fire: "dry vegetable matter, reeds, brushwood, straw, grease, oil, etc." Here we have the material cause. Chang Yu says: "vessels for hoarding fire, stuff for lighting fires."] CHAPTER 13. THE ATTACK BY FIRE 117 3. There is a proper season for making attacks with fire, and special days for starting a conflagration. 4. The proper season is when the weather is very dry; the special days are those when the moon is in the constellations of the Sieve, the Wall, the Wing or the Cross-bar; [These are, respectively, the 7th, 14th, 27th, and 28th of the Twenty-eight Stellar Mansions, corresponding roughly to Sagittarius, Pegasus, Crater and Corvus.] for these four are all days of rising wind. 5. In attacking with fire, one should be prepared to meet five possible devel-
