suffer it at one another's hands, but remain all in order ac? cording to reason-he imitates them and, as much as possible, makes himself like them. Or do you suppose there is any way of keeping someone from imitating that which he admires and therefore keeps company with?" "Ifs not possible," he said. "Then ifs the philosopher, keeping company with the divine and the orderly who becomes orderly and divine, to the extent that is possi? ble for a human being. But there is much slander abroad." "In every way thaf s most certain." "If some necessity arises," I said, "for him to practice putting what he sees there into the dispositions of men, both in private and in public, instead of forming only himself, do you suppose he'll prove to be a bad craftsman of moderation, justice, and vulgar26 virtue as a whole?" "Least of all," he said. "Now, if the many become aware that what we are saying about this man is true, will they then be harsh with the philosophers and dis? trust us when we say that a city could never be happy otherwise than by having its outlines drawn by the painters who use the divine pattern?" "No, they won't be harsh," he said, "provided they do gain this awareness. But what kind of drawing do you mean?" "They would take the city and the dispositions of human beings, as though they were a tablet," I said, "which, in the first place, they would wipe clean. And that's hardly easy. At all events, you know that straight off in this they would differ from the rest-in not being willing to take either private man or city in hand or to draw laws before they receive it clean or themselves make it so." "And they are right," he said. "Next, don't you think they would outline the �shape of the regime?" "Of course." b "After that, I suppose that in filling out their work they would look away frequently in both directions, toward the just, fair, and moderate by nature and everything of the sort, and, again, toward what is in human beings; and thus, mixing and blending the practices as ingredients, they would produce the image of man,27 taking hints from exactly that phenomenon in human beings which Homer too 501 l called god-like and the image of god." "Right," he said. "And I suppose they would rub out one thing and draw in another again, until they made human dispositions as dear to the gods as they admit of being." � "The drawing," he said, "would at any rate be fairest that way." "Are we then somehow persuading those men who you said were coming at us full speed," I said, "that the man we were then praising to them is such a painter of regimes? It was on his account that they were so harsh, because we were handing the cities over to him. Are they any gentler on hearing it now?" "Yes,
