According to this account then, Pin was the grandson of Wu, which, considering that Sun Pin�s victory over Wei was gained in 341 B.C., may be dismissed as chronolo- gical impossible. Whence these data were obtained by Teng Ming-shih I do not know, but of course no reliance whatever can be placed in them. An interesting document which has survived from the close of the Han period is the short preface written by the Great Ts�ao Ts�ao, or Wei Wu Ti, for his edition of Sun Tzu. I shall give it in full: I have heard that the ancients used bows and arrows to their advantage.9 The SHU CHU mentions "the army" among the "eight objects of gov- ernment." The I CHING says: "�army� indicates firmness and justice; the experienced leader will have good fortune." The SHIH CHING says: "The King rose majestic in his wrath, and he marshaled his troops."

He was a descendant of Wu.] 12 In his treatment of deliberation and planning, the importance of rapidity in taking the field, 13 clearness of conception, and depth of design, Sun Tzu stands beyond the reach of carping criticism. My contemporaries, however, have failed to grasp the full meaning of his instructions, and while putting into
