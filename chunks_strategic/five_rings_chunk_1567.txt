man theymost wanted torule, ofcourse,was thefair-minded Deioces. He was hard toconvince, forhewanted nothingmore todowith thevillages’in- fightingandbickering,buttheMedes beggedandpleaded—withouthim the countryhad descended into astate oflawlessness. Deioces finally agreed. Yethealsoimposedconditions. An enormous palacewas tobe con- structed forhim, hewas tobeprovidedwith bodyguards,and acapital city was tobebuilt from which hecould rule. Allofthis wasdone, and Deioces settled into hispalace.Inthe center ofthecapital,thepalacewas sur- rounded bywalls, andcompletelyinaccessible toordinary people.Deioces then established the terms ofhisrule: Admission tohispresencewas for- bidden. Communication with thekingwasonly possible throughmessen- gers.No one intheroyalcourt could seehim more than once aweek, and then only bypermission. Deioces ruled forfifty—three years,extended theMedean empire,and established thefoundation forwhat would later bethe Persian empire, under hisgreat—great—grandson Cyrus. DuringDeioces’ reign,thepeople’s respect forhimgraduallyturned into aform ofworship:He was not amere mortal, they believed, butthe sonofagod. Interpretation Deioces was aman ofgreat ambition. Hedetermined earlyonthat the country needed astrong ruler, and that hewas the man forthejob. lnaland plagued with anarchy, themost powerfulman isthejudge and arbiter. SoDeioces began his career bymakinghisreputationasaman ofimpeccablefairness. Attheheight ofhispowerasajudge, however, Deioces realized the truth ofthelaw ofabsence andpresence: Byservingsomany clients, he had become toonoticeable, tooavailable, and had lost therespecthehad earlier enjoyed. Peoplewere taking hisservices forgranted. Theonly way toregainthe veneration and powerhewanted was towithdraw com- pletely, and lettheMedes taste what life was likewithout him. Ashe ex- pected, theycame begging forhim torule. Once Deioces had discovered thetruth ofthislaw, hecarried ittoits ultimate realization. Inthepalacehispeoplehadbuilt forhim, none could seehim exceptafewcourtiers, and those only rarely.AsHerodotus wrote, “There was arisk thatiftheysaw himhabitually,itmightlead tojealousy andresentment, andplotswould follow; butifnobodysawhim, thelegend wouldgrowthat hewas abeing ofadifferent order from more men.” Aman said toaDervish.‘ “WhydoInot seeyoummofim?"TheDervish replied,“Because thewords ‘Whyhave younot been toseeme?’ are sweeter tomyearthan thewords ‘Whyhaveyoucome again.9’” Mnlllofami. quoted in[dries S./uzh '5(Jaravan ofI)remns_. 1.968 KEYS TO POWER Everythingintheworld dependsonabsence andpresence.
