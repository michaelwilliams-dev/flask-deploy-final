Thedogs' nature opens them tothecom- mand ofphilosophy butdoesnotmake them philosophers. (376c-383c) After Socrates andGlaucon have established the necessity ofanature combining spiritedness andgentleness forthewar- riors, Adeimantus takes hisbrother's place inthediscussion, andhe andSocrates begin theeducation ofthatnature. Onthebasis ofthe description ofthewarriors' function, onewould have expected that their education would beintheartofbearing arms— butthis isnot evenmentioned. The entire discussion concerns thecharacter oftheir soulsandlargely deals with theeffects ofmusic— thelovely domain of theMuses inwhichmencharm their passions when atpeace. Socrates focuses onthecontents ofpoems, thereby implying thattheother ele- ments ofpoetry areonly accessories used forthepuipose ofbetter con- veying atheme orateaching. Thepoets aretaken most seriously asthe makers ofthehorizon which constitutes thelimit ofmen's desire and aspiration; theyfonn thevarious kinds ofmen,whomake nations various. Men's views about thehighest beings and their choice of heroes aredecisive forthetoneoftheir lives.Hewho believes inthe Olympian gods isavery different manfrom theonewhobelieves inthe Biblical God, just asthemanwhoadmires Achilles isdifferent from theonewhoadmires Moses orJesus. The different men seevery dif- ferent things intheworld and,although theymaypartake ofacommon human nature, theydevelop very different aspects ofthatnature; they hardly seem tobeofthesame species, solittledotheyagree about what isimportant inlife.Everything inthecitystems from thebeliefs of thosewhoholdpower andarerespected init.Ifpoetry issopowerful, itscharacter mustbeaprimary concern ofthelegislator. Thereform ofpoetry ismostimmediately directed toAdeimantus andtheteaching hedrew from poetry inhisspeech infavor ofin- justice. Onthebasis ofthe"reformed "poetry, Adeimantus could not [351 ] THEREPUBLIC havecome tohisconclusions. Thegodsdonotgive evil lotstogood men, orgood ones tobadmen, norcantheybemoved byprayer. Just menandjustdeeds aretheonlyones celebrated. There isnothing inthe poetic universe which would makementhink that injustice profits meri orgods. The critique ofpoetry isdivided according tothemost important effects itsrepresentations haveonmen's beliefs, inparticular, their beliefs about thegods, courage, andmoderation. Justice cannot be treated here, Socrates says,because theyhave notyetdecided whethei; justice isgood ornot,andthatwould beessential tosuch adiscussion! Thebeliefs about thegodsandthepoetic depiction ofthem arethe first topic Socrates andAdeimantus undertake. Courage, moderation, and justice— three ofthefourcardinal virtues defined intheRepublic—are eachmentioned inthecontext ofthecritique ofpoetry, butthefourth, wisdom, isnot. Itwould seem necessary toinfer thatthewarriors are nottobewiseandthatthebeliefs about thegods aretheir substitute for wisdom. Those beliefs about thegods areanonphilosophic equivalent ofknowledge ofthewhole. The firstsegment ofthestudy ofpoetry constitutes, therefore, atheology, atheology nottruebutsalutary. Its doctrines aresimple: thegods aregood; they arethecause ofthegood; andtheydonotdeceive. Nothing issaidabout thenature ofthegods' re- lations withmen orwhether theycare formen atall.Similarly, there is noassurance thatthese aretheOlympian gods orthattheyhave any- thing incommon withwhatAdeimantus understands agodtobe.Cer- tainly Cephalus' piety, based onappeals tothegods forleniency, be- comes, inthis light, highly questionable. Itisnoteven clear that itis sensible topray tosuch gods. Acloser look atSocrates' prescriptions fortherepresentations of thegodsshows thattheyarenot,inhisview, allpowerful andthatthey aresubordinated torational principle. Theymustbegoodandcanonly cause good; thedeeper teaching implied here isthatthegood isthe highest andmost powerful principle ofthecosmos. Asopposed tothe earlier views ofthe firstthings which thepoets express, chaos isnotthe origin ofallthings; andtheuniverse isfundamentally acosmos, nota battlefield ofcontrary anddiscordant elements, asthepoets represent it tobeintheir terrible tales ofthefamily livesandwars ofthegods.
