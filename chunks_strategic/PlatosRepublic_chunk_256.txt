what about this? Do you say there is something bad and something good for each thing-for example, ophthalmia for the eyes, and sickness for the entire body, blight for grain, rot for wood, rust for iron and bronze, and, as I say, for nearly aJl things is there an evil and illness naturally connected with each?" "I do," he� said. "When one of these attaches itself to something, doesn't it make the thing to which it attaches itself bad and, in the end, whoJly dissolve and destroy it?" "Undeniably." "Therefore the evil naturaHy connected with each thing and its particular badness destroys it, or if this doesn't destroy it, surely there is nothing else that could stiJ1 corrupt it. For surely the good would never destroy anything, nor, again, would what is neither bad nor good." "How could they?" he said. "Therefore, if we find any existing thing that has an evil that makes it bad but is, however, not able to dissolve and destroy it, then won't we know that for a thing that is naturaHy so there is no destruc? tion?" i�.
