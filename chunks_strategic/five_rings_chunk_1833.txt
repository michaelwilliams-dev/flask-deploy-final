Their particular prejudices mustbeovercome, butnotbytrue persuasion ofthetruth; thenewteaching mustbemade toappear tobe inaccord with their ancestrally hallowed opinions. Important conces- sionsmustbemade tothose opinions, since they areinalterable. The discussions indicate such difficulties andarepreliminary totheessen- tialactoflawgiving. Laws bytheir nature have thecharacter of monologue rather than dialogue, andthey arenotsupposed todiscuss orbediscussed; thus thepresentation ofthelaws tends tobeinter- rupted less.(The strength andweakness oflaw liesinthefactthat itis thepolar opposite ofphilosophic discussion. The intention ofa dialogue isthecause ofitsform,andthatintention comes tolight only tothosewho reflect onitsform.I ThePlatonic dialogues donotpresent adoctrine; theyprepare the way forphilosophizing. They areintended toperform thefunction ofa living teacher whomakes hisstudents think,)whoknows which ones should beledfurther andwhich onesshould bekeptaway from the mysteries, andwhomakes them exercise thesame faculties andvirtues instudying hiswords astheywould have touseinstudying nature in- dependently. Onemust philosophize tounderstand them. There isa Platonic teaching, but itisnomore tobefound inanyofthespeeches than isthethought ofShakespeare tobefound intheutterances ofany particular character. That thought isinnone oftheparts but issome- how inthewhole, andtheprocess ofarriving atitismore subtle than thatinvolved inreading atreatise. Onemust look atthemicrocosm of thedrama just asonewould look atthemacrocosm oftheworld which itrepresents. Every detail ofthatworld isaneffect oftheun- derlying causes which canbegrasped onlybythemind butwhich canbeunearthed onlybyusing allthesenses aswell.Those causes aretrulyknown onlywhen they arecome tobyway ofthefullest consciousness oftheworld which they cause. Otherwise onedoes notknow what tolook fornorcanoneknow the fullpower ofthe causes. Ateaching which gives only theprinciples remains abstract and ismere dogma, forthestudent himself does notknow what the principles explain nordoesheknow enough oftheworld tobesure that their explanations areanything more than partial. Itisthisrich consciousness ofthephenomena onwhich thedialogues insist, and theythemselves provide atraining init. [xxi] Preface Thehuman world ischaracterized bythedistinction between speech anddeed, andweallrecognize that inorder tounderstand a man orwhathesaysboth aspects mustbetaken intoaccount. Justas noaction ofamancanbeinterpreted without hearing whathesays about ithimself, nospeech canbeaccepted onitsfacevalue without corhparing ittotheactions ofitsauthor. Theunderstanding oftheman andhisspeeches isaresult ofacombination ofthetwoperspectives. Thrasymachus' blush isasimportant asanyofhistheoretical argu- ments.Astudent whohasonhisownpieced together thenature ofthe rhetorician onthebasis ofhisrepresentation intheRepublic has grasped hisnature with asureness grounded onaperception ofthe universal seenthrough theparticular. This ishisown insight, andhe knows itmore authentically andsurely thansomeone whohasbeen given adefinition. This joins theconcreteness ofr§^firit^efinesse tothe science ofI'esprit deg^grnetrie ;itavoids thepitfalls ofparticularistic sensitivity, ontfieonehand, andabstractness ontheother. Poetand scientist become one, forthetialents ofboth arenecessary totheattain- ment oftheonlyend— thetruth. ThePlatonic dialogues arearepresentation oftheworld; theyare acosmos inthemselves. Tointerpret them, theymustbeapproached as onewould approach theworld, bringing withone allone's powers. The only difference between thedialogues aiidtheworld isthat the dialogues aresoconstructed thateach part isintegrally connected with every other part; there arenomeaningless accidents. Plato reproduced theessential world ashesaw it.Every word has itsplace and itsmean- ing,andwhen onecannot with assurance explain any detail, hecan know that hisunderstanding isincomplete. When something seems boring orhastobeexplained away asaconvention, itmeans thatthe interpreter hasgiven upandhastaken hisplaceamong theranks of those Plato intended toexclude from thecenter ofhisthought. Itis always thatwhich strikes usascommonplace orabsurd which indi- cates thatwearenotopen tooneofthemysteries, forsuch sentiments aretheprotective mechanisms which prevent ourframework from being shaken. Thedialogues areconstructed withanalmost unbelievable care andsubtlety. Thedrama iseverywhere, even inwhatseem tobethe most stock responses orthemost purely theoretical disquisitions.
