this for the craftsmen, while for the rich and reputed happy we don't." "How's that?" he said. "A carpenter," I said, "when he's sick, thinks fit to drink some medicine from the doctor and vomit up his disease or have it purged out from below, or submit to burning or cutting and be rid of it. If someone prescribes a lengthy regimen for him, putting bandages around his head and what goes with them, he soon says that he has no leisure to be sick nor is a life thus spent-paying attention to a disease while neglecting the work at hand-of any profit. And, with that, he says goodbye to such a doctor and returns to his accus? tomed regimen; regaining his health, he lives minding his own busi? ness; if his body is inadequate to bearing up under it, he dies and is rid of his troubles." "For this kind of man at least," he said, "it's thought proper to use medicine in this way." "Is it," I said, "because he had a definite job, and if he couldn't do 407 1 it, it would be of no profit to go on Jiving?" "Plainly," he said. [ 85] 407 a b C d e 408 a "While the rich man, as we claim, has no such job at hand that makes his life unlivable if he's compelled to keep away from it." "At least there's not said to be." "That," I said, 1s because you don't listen to how Phocylides57 says that when someone already has a livelihood he must practice virtue." "I, for my part," he said, "suppose he must also do so before that." "Let's not fight with him about that," I said. "But let's instruct ourselves as to whether the rich man must practice it and whether life is unlivable for the one who doesn't practice it, or whether care of sickness is a hindrance in paying attention to carpentry and the other arts, but doesn't hinder Phocylides' exhortation." "Yes, by Zeus," he said, "this excessive care of the body, if it's over and above gymnastic, hinders it just about more than anything. And it's troublesome in the management of a household, on a cam? paign, and in sedentary offices in the city." "But most important of all, surely, is that it also makes any kind of learning, thought, or meditation by oneself hard; it is always on the lookout for tensions and spinning in the head and holds philosophy to blame. So that wherever virtue is practiced and made to undergo scru- . tiny in this way, this care of the body is in every way a hindrance. It al? ways makes one suppose he's sick and never cease to take pains about ,his body." ï¿½ "Quite likely," he said. "Then won't we say that Asclepius, top, knew this and revealed an art of medicine for those whose bodies are by nature and regimen in a healthy condition but have some distinct and definite disease
