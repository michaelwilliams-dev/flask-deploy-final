we also assert the same about sex and the other desires?" "Yes, we'll assert the same." "And weren't we also saying that the man we just named a drone is full of such pleasures and desires and is ruled by the unnecessary ones, while the stingy oligarchic man is ruled by the necessary ones?" d 559d e 560a "Of course we were." "Well, then, going back again," I said, "let's say how the demo? cratic man comes out of the oligarchic one. And it looks to me as though it happens in most cases like this." "How?" "When a young man, reared as we were just saying without educa? tion and stingily, tastes the drones' honey, and has intercourse with fiery, clever beasts who are able to purvey manifold and subtle pleasures with every sort of variety, you presumably suppose that at this point he begins his change from an oligarchic regime within himself to a democratic one." "Most necessarily," he said. "Then, just as the city was transformed when an alliance from outside brought aid to one party, like to like, is the young man also transformed in the same way when desires of a kindred and like form from without bring aid to one party of desires within him?" "That's entirely certain." "And, I suppose, if a counteralliance comes to the aid of the oligarchic party in him, either from the advice and scolding of his father or from other relatives, then faction and counterfaction arise in him and he does battle with himself."

"But I suppose that onceï¿½ again other desires, akin to the exiled b. ones, reared in secret due to the father's lack of knowledge about rear? ing, came to be, many and strong." "At least," he said, "that's what usually happens." "Then, drawn to the same associations, their secret intercourse bred a multitude." "Of course." "And, fina]ly, I suppose they took the acropolis of the young man's soul, perceiving that it was empty of fair studies and practices and true speeches,.and it's these that are the best watchmen and guard? ians in the thought of men whom the gods love." b. "They are by far the best," he said. "Then, in their absence, false and boasting speeches and opinions ran up and seized that place in such a young man." "Indeed they did," he said.
