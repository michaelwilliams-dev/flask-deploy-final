Atfirst Ninon was amused tohear the marquistalkabout hismistakes, butfinally shehad had enough. Unable to bear ineptitudeinanyrealm, least ofallinseducingawoman, shedecided totake theyoungman under herwing. First, hehad tounderstand that this was war, and that thebeautiful countess was{citadel towhich hehad to laysiegeascarefullyasanygeneral. Every step had tobeplanned and exe- cuted with theutmost attention todetail and nuance. Instructing themarquistostart over, Ninon told him toapproach the countess with abitofdistance, anairofnonchalance. The next time the two were alone together,shesaid, hewould confide inthe countess as would afriend but notva potentiallover. This was tothrow heroffthescent. The countess was nolongertotake hisinterest inherforgranted-perhaps hewasonlyinterested infriendship. Ninon plannedahead. Once the countess was confused, itwould be time tomake herjealous. Atthenext encounter, atamajorféte inParis, the marquis would show upwith abeautiful youngwoman athisside. This beautiful youngwoman hadequally beautiful friends, sothat wherever the countess would now seethemarquis, hewould besurrounded bythemost stunning youngwomen inParis. Notonlywould the countess beseething withjealousy,shewould come toseethemarquisassomeone who was de- sired byothers. Itwashard forNinon tomake themarquis understand, but shepatiently explained that awoman who isinterested inaman wants to seethat other women areinterested inhim, too. Notonlydoes thatgive him instant value, itmakes itallthe more satisfying tosnatch him from their clutches. Once the countess wasjealousbutintrigued,itwould betime tobe- guileher. OnNinon’s instructions, themarquis would failtoshow upataf- fairs where the countess expectedtoseehim. Then, suddenly,hewould appearatsalons hehad never frequented before, butthat the countess at- LAW 3 I7 18 LAW 3tended often. Shewould beunable topredict his moves. Allofthiswould push herinto the state ofemotional confusion that isaprerequisitefor sum cessful seduction. These moves were executed, and took several weeks. Ninon moni- tored themarquis’s progress: Through hernetwork ofspies,sheheard how the countess would laughalittle harder athiswitticisms, listen more closelytohisstories. Sheheard that the countess wassuddenly asking ques- tions about him. Her friends told her that atsocial affairs the countess would often lookupatthemarquis, following hissteps.Ninon feltcertain that theyoungwoman wasfallingunder hisspell. Itwas amatter ofweeks now, maybeamonth ortwo, butifallwent smoothly,thecitadel would fall. Afewdayslater themarquiswas atthecountess’s home. Theywere alone. Suddenly hewas adifferent man: This time actingonhis own im— pulse,rather than following Ninon’s instructions, hetook the countess’s hands and told her he was inlove with her. Theyoungwoman seemed confused,3reaction hedid notexpect. She became polite,then excused herself. Forthe restoftheeveningsheavoided hiseyes,was notthere to saygoodnighttohim. The next few times hevisited he was told she was not athome. When shefinallyadmitted him again,thetwo feltawkward anduncomfortable with each other. Thespellwas broken. Interpretation Ninon deLenclos knew everything about theartoflove. The greatestwrit- ers,thinkers, andpoliticians ofthetime had been her lovers——men like La Rochefoucauld, Moliére, andRichelieu. Seduction was agame toher, tobe practiced with skill. Asshegotolder, and herreputation grew, the most im~ portant families inFrance would send their sons toher tobeinstructed in matters oflove. Ninon knew that men and women arevery different, but when it comes toseduction they feelthe same: Deepdown inside, theyoften sense when theyarebeing seduced, butthey giveinbecause they enjoy thefeel- ingofbeingledalong.
