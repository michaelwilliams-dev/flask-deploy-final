travel hundreds of miles without fatigue, go over land where there are no people. CAO CAO Make it impossible for the enemy to get there to the rescue. Appear where there is an opening and strike at a gap; avoid where they are guarding, hit where they are not expecting it. CHEN HAO Striking at an open gap does not only mean where the opponent has no defense. As long as the defense is not strict, the place is not tightly guarded, the generals are weak and the troops are disorderly, the supplies are scarce and the forces are isolated, if you face them with an orderly and prepared army, they will fall apart in front of you. This way you do not need to labor and suffer, for it is as if you were traveling over unpopulated territory. Master Sun To unfailingly take what you attack, attack where there is no defense.

If you are unfathomable, then what you guard is not attacked by opponents. Master Sun So in the case of those who are skilled in attack, their opponents do not know where to defend. In the case of those skilled in defense, their opponents do not know where to attack. CAO CAO This means true information is not leaked. JIA LIN When directives are carried out, people are sincerely loyal, preparations for defense are firmly secured, and yet you are so subtle and secretive that you reveal no form, opponents are unsureï¿½their intelligence is of no avail. MEI YAOCHEN Those good at attack do not divulge their operational secrets; those good at defense prepare thoroughly, without gaps. Master Sun Be extremely subtle, even to the point of formlessness.
