"The Prince isby Machiavelli ,from Florence ,Italy .” "Yes ,ofcourse .Iknow that .” 66 "What doyou know about him ?” "He's the bad guy .Our politicians learn how toscheme and how to cheat from him ...abad dude ,not one to have inmy house ." "What else doyou know about him ?For instance ,have you actually read his Prince ,or any other works ,including his plays ?" "Plays ?Ididn't know hewrote plays .Ihaven't read them .” Ihad more orless asimilar dialogue with anolder professor recently retired from aleading institution ofhigher learning .He said ,"Machiavelli isthe father ofthe tenet ,the means justifies the end ,that men would use any means toachieve their goals , and that hesanctions that kind ofbehavior ." "Can you cite where Machiavelli says that ?" ―"No ,Icannot .Iremember itfrom asurvey course too many years ago !Besides ,Iwasn't interested inhim then ,and I am not interested inhim now ...What else are you publishing ?"

THE PRINCE —7 Inarecent conversation, inItalian, awell-educated medical doctor used thename Machiavelli asasynonym forintrigues of unsavory nature. These examples reflect ageneral impression ofMachiavelli, theman, andMachiavelli, thewriter. Those who have read him indepth have positive opinions; those who have notread hisworks have negative opinions. The former usually express praise forthewayhelived--a rather sub- dued lifedevoid ofostentation, andexpress greater praise forthe quality ofhisprose andthedepth ofintelligence inhiswritings, especially inThePrince. But, despite thepositive andnegative press, ThePrince continues tobeabestseller, andMachiavelli is forever popular among young andold,regardless onhow one spins him. With editions published throughout theworld, the name Machiavelli isbecoming more famous, more relevant, and more accepted. Because ofthisrelevancy, politicians read himandkeep ap- plying oradhering tohisprinciples ofgoverning. ButlikeSaint Peter reneging Christ, theywillnotadmit toanintellectual orpo- litical connection tothefounder ofSocial Science. Machiavelli, whose lifeandworks arebased ontheRoman concept ofvirtue, would notsubscribe toopposites ofvirtue and wedonotseetraces toclassify himaslacking invirtue. This be- ingthecase, how didhegetthereputation wherein being Ma- chiavellian connotes being evil, scheming, anddissimulating? Isitpossible thatMachiavelli could bevirtuous andevilatthe same time depending ontheroleheisplaying? Ishisdescription ofhuman nature sostark thatwecannot accept itforwhat itis? Or,isMachiavelli wrong inhisobservations? Theproblem isthatwesecretly believe thatwhat hesays is right butwillnotadmit toit.Asaresult, weascribe tohimthose negatives attributes andblame himforbeing itsmessenger! Thestrange thing isthatwhile wemaylearn from hisscience, wedeny him entrance through ourfront door butkeep apath open forhimtocome inthrough theback door. And herein lies 8- Niccolò Machiavelli the Machiavellian paradox . When hesuggests guiding principles for aPrince concerning his land and people ,the principles are not anchored inMachia- velli ,the man ,but inMachiavelli ,the scientist ,the cool observer ofhuman nature .Because those principles are revealed through his science ,we should judge him bythe science he's discovered and not bythe truths discovered through that science ,because too often those truths are not toour liking . Like other creatures ,humans are initially driven by an all- encompassing instinct - hunger . Although other creatures are destined togofrom one meal to another ,never knowing the whereabouts ofthe next meal
