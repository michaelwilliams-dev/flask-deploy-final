since it'sbyexperience, prudence, andargument—" "What thelover ofwisdom andthelover ofargument praise would necessarily bemost true," hesaid. 583a "Therefore, ofthethree pleasures, themost pleasant would belong tothatpartofthesoulwithwhichwelearn; andthemanamong usin whom thispart rules hasthemost pleasant life." "Ofcourse hehas,"hesaid. "Atleast itisasasovereign praiser thattheprudent man praises hisown life." "What life," Isaid, "does thejudge say isinsecond place and what pleasure isinsecond place?" "Plainly thatofthewarlike manandlover ofhonor. For itis nearer tohimthan thatofthemoney-maker." "Then thepleasure ofthelover ofgain isinlastplace, asit seems." "Ofcourse," hesaid. b "Well then, thatmakes twoinarow,andtwice thejustman has been victorious overtheunjust one.Now thethird, inOlympic fashion, tothesavior andtheOlympian Zeus.'' Observe thattheother men's pleasure, except forthatoftheprudent man, isneither entirely truenor pure but isasortofshadow painting, asIseem tohaveheard from [264 ] BookIX/582d-584a socrates/glaucon someoneofthewise.And yetthiswould bethegreatest andmost 583b sovereign ofthe falls." "By far.Butwhat doyoumean?" "With youanswering andmeseeking," Isaid, "I'llfindout." c "Ask," hesaid. "Tell me," Isaid, "don'twesaypain istheopposite ofpleasured' "Quite so." "Don't wealsosaythatbeing aflPected byneither joynorpain is something?" "Wedoindeed saythat itis." "Is itinthemiddle between these two,acertain repose ofthesoul with respect tothem? Ordon'tyousay it'sthatway?" "Just so,"hesaid. "Don't youremember," Isaid, "thewords ofsickmen, spoken when they aresick?" "What words?" "That after allnothing ismore pleasant thanbeing healthy, but before theywere sick ithadescaped them that itismost pleasant." d "Idoremember," hesaid. "And don'tyoualsohear thosewho areundergoing some intense suffering saying thatnothing ismore pleasant thanthecessation ofsuf- fering?" "Idohearthem." "And Isuppose you areaware ofmany other similar cir- cumstances inwhich human beings, while they areinpain, extol as most pleasant notenjoyment butrather theabsence ofpainandrepose from it." "For," hesaid, "atthattimerepose perhaps becomes pleasant and enough tocontent them." "Andwhen aman's enjoyment ceases," Isaid, "then therepose e from pleasure willbepainful." "Perhaps," hesaid. "Therefore, whatwewere justsaying isbetween thetwo—repose —will attimes beboth, painandpleasure." "So itseems." "And isitpossible thatwhat isneither canbecome both?" "Not inmyopinion." "And, moreover, thepleasant andthepainful, when they arise in thesoul, areboth asortofmotion, aren't they?" "Yes." "And didn't what isneither painful norpleasant, however, just 584a come tolight asrepose and inthemiddle between these two?" "Yes, that's theway itcame tolight."" [265 ] socrates/glatjcon theREPUBLJpI 584a "Thenhowcan itberight tobelieve thattheabsence ofsuffering ispleasant orthattheabsence ofenjoyment isgrievous?" "Innoway." "Therefore itisnotso," Isaid, "butwhen itisnext tothepainful repose looks pleasant andnext tothepleasant, painful; andinthese ap- pearances there isnothing sound, sofarastruth ofpleasure goes, onlya certain wizardry." "Sotheargument indicates, atleast," hesaid. b "Well, then," Isaid, "look atpleasures that don'tcome outof pains, sothatyouwon't perhaps suppose inthepresent instance that it isnaturally thecase thatpleasure isrestfrompainandpain restfrom pleasure." "Where shall Ilook," hesaid, "andwhat pleasures doyou mean?" "There aremany others, too," Isaid, "but, ifyouarewilling to reflect onthem, thepleasures ofsmells inparticular. Forthese, without previous pain, suddenly become extraordinarily great and,oncehaving ceased, leave nopainbehind." "Very true," hesaid, c "Then, let's notbepersuaded that relief from pain ispure pleasure orthat relief from pleasure ispure pain." "No, let'snot,"hesaid. "However," Isaid, "oftheso-called pleasures stretched through thebody tothesoul, justabout most, andthegreatest ones, belong to thisform; they arekinds ofrelief from pains." "Yes, they are." "Isn't thisalsothecasewith theanticipatory pleasures andpains arising from expectation ofpleasures andpains thataregoing tobe?" Yes, itIS. d "Doyou," Isaid,"know what sortofthings they areandwhat they aremost like?" "What?" hesaid. "Doyou," Isaid, "hold thatup,down, andmiddle aresomething innature?" "Ido."
