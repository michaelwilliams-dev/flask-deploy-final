called bad ground. HO YANXI Bad ground is land that lacks stability and is unsuitable for building fortifications and trenches. It is best to leave such terrain as quickly as possible. Master Sun When the way in is narrow and the way out is circuitous, so a small enemy force can strike you, even though your numbers are greater, this is called surrounded ground. MEI YAOCHEN If you are capable of extraordinary adaptation, you can travel this ground. ZHANG YU On ground that is hemmed in in front and walled off behind, a single defender can hold off a thousand men, so on such ground you win by ambush. Master Sun When you will survive if you fight quickly and perish if you do not, this is called dying ground. CHEN HAO People on dying ground are, as it were, sitting in a leaking boat, lying in a burning house. MEI YAOCHEN When you cannot press forward, cannot retreat backward, and cannot run to the sides, you have no choice but to fight right away. Master Sun So let there be no battle on a ground of dissolution, let there be no stopping on light ground, let there be no attack on a ground of contention, let there be no cutting off of trafficked ground. On intersecting ground form communications, on heavy ground plunder, on bad ground keep going, on surrounded ground make plans, on dying ground fight. LI QUAN On a ground of dissolution, the soldiers might run away. MEI YAOCHEN Light ground is where soldiers have first entered enemy territory and do not yet have their backs to the wall; hence the minds of the soldiers are not really concentrated, and they are not ready for battle. At this point it is imperative to avoid important cities and highways, and it is advantageous to move quickly onward. CAO CAO It is not advantageous to attack an enemy on a ground of contention; what is advantageous is to get there first. WANG XI Trafficked ground should not be cut off, so that the roads may be used advantageously as supply routes. MENG SHI On intersecting ground, if you establish alliances you are safe, if you lose alliances you are in peril. CAO CAO On heavy ground, plundering means building up supplies. Li Quan added, �When you enter deeply into enemy territory you should not antagonize people by acting unjustly. When the founder of the great Han dynasty entered the homeland of the supplanted Qin dynasty, there was no rapine or pillage, and this is how he won the people�s hearts.� LI QUAN On bad ground, since you cannot entrench, you should make haste to leave there. CAO CAO On surrounded ground, bring surprise tactics into play. CHEN HAO If they fall into dying ground, then everyone in the army will spontaneously fight. This is why it is said, �Put them on dying ground, and then they will live.� Master Sun Those who are called the good militarists of old
