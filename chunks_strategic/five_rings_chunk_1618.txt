YetifDaizen offered tohelp Soemon payback theloam, he would refuse, outofpride, andmighteven beoffended. One dayDaizen visited hisfriend, and after touring thegarden and lookingatSoemon’s prized peonies, theyretired tohisreceptionroom. Here Daizen saw apainting bythemaster Kano Tennyu. “Ah,” Daizen ex- claimed, “asplendid piece ofpainting.. . .Idon’t know when Ihave seen anythingIlike better.” After several more bouts ofpraise, Soemon had no choice: “Well,” hesaid, “sinceyou like itsomuch, Ihope you will dome thefavor ofacceptingit.” Atfirst Daizen refused, but when Soemon insisted hegavein.The next daySoemon inturn received apackagefrom Daizen. Inside itwas a beautiful and delicate vase, which Daizen, inanaccompanying note, asked hisfriend toacceptasatoken ofhisappreciationforthepainting that Soe~ mon had sograciously given him theday before. Heexplainedthat the vase had been made bySen noRikyu himself, and bore aninscription from Emperor Hideyoshi. IfSoemon didnot care forthe vase, Daizensug~ gested, hemight make agiftofittoanadherent ofCha«no—yu—-perhaps themerchant Kawachiya Sanemon, who had often expressedadesire to possessit.“Ihear,” Daizen continued, “he has afinepiece offancy paper [the3()()~ryo I.O.U.] whichyouwould much like. Itispossible youmight arrangeanexchange.” Realizingwhat hisgracious friend wasupto,Soemon took the vase to thewealthylender. “However didyou getthis,” exclaimed Sanemon, when Soemon showed him the vase. “Ihave often heard ofit,butthis isthe first time Ihave ever seen it.Itissuch atreasure that itisnever allowed outside thegate!” Heinstantlyoffered toexchange thedebt note forthe flower vase, and togiveSoemon 300ryomore ontopofit.ButSocmon, who did not care formoney, onlywanted the debt note back, and Sanemon gladly gave ittohim. Then Soemon immediatelyhunied to Daizen’s house tothank him forhisclever support Interpretation Kuriyama Daizen understood that thegrantingofafavor isnever simple: Ifitisdone withfuss andobviousness, itsreceiver feels burdened byan obligation. This may give thedoor acertain power,butitisapowerthat willeventually self-destruct, foritwill stirupresentment and resistance. A favor done indirectlyandelegantlyhas ten times morepower. Daizen knew adirect approach would only have offended Soemon.Bylettinghis friend givehim thepainting, however, hemade Soemon feel that hetoo hadpleasedhisfriend with agift.Intheend, allthree parties emerged from the encounter feeling fulfilled intheir own way. Inessence, Daizen made himself thecat’s-paw,thetool totake the chestnuts outofthefire.

The courtier uses hisgloved hand tosoften anyblows against him, disguise hisscars, and make the actofrescue more elegant and clean. By helping others, thecourtier eventually helps himself.
