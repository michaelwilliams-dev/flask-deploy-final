the power it has?" "What sort of part do you mean?" "This sort. The same magnitude surely doesn't look equal to our sight from near and from far." "No, it doesn't." "And the same things look bent and straight when seen in water and out of it, and also both concave and convex, due to the sight's being misled by the colors, and every sort of confusion of this kind is plainly in our soul. And, then, it is because they take advantage of this affection in our nature that shadow painting, and puppeteering, and many other tricks of the kind fall nothing short of wizardry." "True."" "And haven't measuring, counting, and weighing come to light as 601 e 602 a b C cl 602d e most charming helpers in these cases? As a result of them, we are not ruled by a thing's looking bigger or smaller or more or heavier; rather we are ruled by that which has calculated, measured, or, if you please weighed."

"Exactly," he said. "Therefore, imitation, an ordinary thing having intercourse with what is ordinary, produces ordinary offspring." "It seems so." "Does this," I said, "apply only to the imitation connected with the sight or also to that connected with the hearing, which we name poetry?" "It is likely," he said, "that it applies also to this." "WeJI, then," I said, "let's not just trust the likelihood based on painting; but let's now go directly to the very part of thought with which poetry's imitation keeps company and see whether it is ordinary or serious." Book X I 602d-604b GLAUCON/SOCRATES "We must." "Let's present it in this way. Imitation, we say, imitates human beings performing forced or voluntary actions, and, as a
