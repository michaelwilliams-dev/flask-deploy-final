once againthe most powerfulforce inPrussia. When Frederick died, in1861, hisbrother William assumed the throne. William disliked Bismarck intenselyand had nointention ofkeep inghim around. But healso inherited the same situation hisbrother had: enemies galore,who wanted tonibble hispower away. Heactuallyconsid- ered abdicating, feelinghelacked thestrengthtodeal with thisdangerous andprecarious position.But Bismarck insinuated himself once again.He stood bythe newking, gave himstrength,andurged him into firm andde cisive action. Theking grew dependentonBismarck’s strong-armtactics to keephisenemies atbay, anddespitehisantipathytoward theman, hesoon made him hisprimeminister. The twoquarreledoften overpolicy——— Bismarck was much more conservative——but theking understood his own dependency.Whenever theprimeminister threatened toresign,theking gaveintohim, time after time. Itwasinfact Bismarck who setstate policy. Years later, Bismarck’s actions asPn1ssia’s prime minister ledthevari ous German states tobeunited into one country. Now Bismarck finagled theking intolettinghimself becrownedemperor ofGermany.Yetitwas really Bismarck who had reached theheights ofpower.Asrigl1t—handman totheemperor,and asimperial chancellor zmdknighted prince,hepulled allthelevers. lnterpretalion Most youngand ambitious politicians lookingout onthepolitical landscape of18405 Germanywould have tried tobuild apowerbase among those with themostpower.Bismarck saw different. Joiningforces with thepow- erful can befoolish: They will swallow you up,justasthe(logeofVenice swalloweduptheCount ofCarmagnola.No onewill come todependon youiftheyarealready strong.Ifyouareambitious, itismuch wiser toseek outweak rulers ormasters with whom youcan create arelationship of do pendency.You become their strength,their intelligence, their spine.What power you hold!
