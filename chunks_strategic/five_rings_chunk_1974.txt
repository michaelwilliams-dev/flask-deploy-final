earn theirgood willandteachthem torespect histastes. Otherwise hewould have togiveuphiswayoflife.Hewill only give asmuch ofhimself asisrequired toregain hisfreedom. This situation isaparadigm oftherelation ofthephilosopher tothecity. Thedifference between theRepublic andtheApology isthatthethreat ofcompulsion used intheRepublic isonly playful while thatofthe Athenian lawcourt intheApology isindeadly earnest. IntheApology Socrates iscondemned todeath because acompromise acceptable to [310 ] Interpretive Essay thepeople would havemeant hisspiritual death; intheRepublic, dealing with adifferent audience, heemerges astheruler ofatamed citywhichmaynotunderstand himbutwhich isatleast willing toper- mithimtheunbridled pursuit ofphilosophy andaccess tothenoble youth. Socrates hadaccompanied Glaucon tothePiraeus both topray andtosee;hewasmotivated bypietyandbytheoryâ€” intheprimitive andmost revealing sense ofthatterm, idle curiosity. TheAthenians were introducing anewgoddess intotheir cult.Socrates hints that itis theAthenians whobring innew divinities; ifhe,too,does so,heonly imitates thedemocracy, withwhich hehasmore kinship thanappears onthesurface. (Adeimantus finally persuades Socrates tostay inthe Piraeus bythepromise ofanother innovation: atorch raceonhorse- back. The conversation, alsoaninnovation and itself innovating, takes theplace ofthattorch raceand isparallel toit.Socrates hasa taste fornewness which isantithetical tothebest political orders and which heshares withthedemocracy. Thedifference between Athenian andSocratic tastes, however, canbemeasured bythedifference be- tween atorch race inhonor ofthegoddess andafriendly discussion about justice.) Socrates' piety brings himdown tothePiraeus with Glaucon andputshimintothesituation where hemust discuss thecity, and that piety disposes him tocare forthe city.But hispiety is somewhat lax; itisopen tochange andmixed with curiosity. Hedoes not tellustheresult ofhisprayers, buthisobservations ledhimtothe recognition thattheAthenian procession wasnobetter than thatofthe Thracians. Socrates' theory stands above theenthusiasm ofnational pride and issomehow beyond mere citizenship. Hispiety belongs tothecity; histhought does not. Polemarchus seeshimhurrying offandorders aslave toorderhim tostay.This little scene prefigures thethree-class structure ofthegood regime developed intheRepublic andouthnes thewhole political problem. Power isinthehands ofthegentlemen, who arenotphilos- ophers. They cancommand theservices ofthemany, and their strength issuch thattheyalways hold thephilosophers intheir grasp. Therefore itispartofthephilosophers' self-interest tocome toterms withthem.Thequestion becomes: towhat extent canthephilosophers influence thegentlemen? Itisthiscrucial middle classwhich isthe primary object oftheRepublic andtheeducation prescribed init.In thisepisode, thefirstfact isbrute force, leading totherecognition thatno matter howreasonable onemay be,everything depends upon thepeo- ple'swillingness tolisten. There isaconfrontation herebetween wisdom, asrepresented bySocrates, andpower, asrepresented byPolemarchus [311 ] THEREPUBLIC and hisfriends. Atfirsttheopposition ofthetwoprinciples iscom- plete, butAdeimantus andPolemarchus trytomake Socrates choose to remain byoffering himpleasant occupations ifhedoes so.Glaucon ac- ceptsonbehalf ofhisfriend, andSocrates grudgingly gives intothefait accomfyli. Hence wisdom andpower reach acompromise, andamin- fature community isformed. Thisaccomplished, they take avoteand ratify their decision, andanewprinciple ofruleemerges: consent. Itis amixture ofpowerless wisdom andunwise power. Allpolitical lifewill befounded onsuchcompromises, more orless satisfactory, until the means canbediscovered topermit theabsolute ruleofwisdom. Since heisforced tobecome amember ofthiscommunity, Socrates soon establishes himself asitsrulerbyovercoming theother aspirants tothe office, andthenheproceeds tofound apolitical regime inwhich philosophers will rule. {328b-331d) Having made their social contract, themembers of thegroup gotoPolemarchus' house where they findhisfather, Ceph- alus,whodominates thescene, andwhodoes soprecisely because he isthefather. Age ishis title torule, asitisinalmost allregimes governed byancestral custom. Age isapractical substitute forwisdom because, unlike wisdom, itispolitically recognizable and easily defined. Itismore feasible toteach force torespect agethan toteach it torespect wisdom. Thereverence forage,andhence antiquity, isone ofthestrongest tieswhich canbind acivil society together. Butinor- dertocarryonafrank discussion about justice, thisreverence mustbe overcome, andthephilosopher must taketheplace ofthefather atthe center ofthecircle. Socrates must induce Cephalus toleave thescene, because Cephalus isbeyond reason, and itwould beimpious todispute him. Once authority hasbeen banished, Socrates
