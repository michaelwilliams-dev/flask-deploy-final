"Well," I said, "now that we've come up to this point in the argu? {ment, from a lookout as it were, it looks to me as though there is one Jorm for virtue and an unlimited number for vice, but some four among \them are also worth mentioning." "How do you mean?" ,, "There are," I said, "likely to be as many types of soul as there (are types of regimes possessing distinct forms."
