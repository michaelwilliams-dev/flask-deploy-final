Ourawareness ofthem isnotperfectly sure,butauniversal doubt ofthemwould lead usintoavoid; itwould leave uswithnothing. Itiscalled trust precisely because itresists doubt oftheexistence ofwhat itapprehends. Knowl- edgeorphilosophy istheclarification andarticulation ofthisnatural con- sciousness. Imagination isnobeginning point forknowledge because it cannot distinguish between what ismerely ashadow, adistortion caused bytheidiosyncrasies ofourmental vision orthose ofthe reflecting medium, andwhat isanaccurate reflection oftheobjects. Only theawareness thatanimage isanimage makes itpossible to judge itstruecharacter, andinorder tohave thatawareness imagina- tionmustbeaided bythefaculty oftrust. Butwho regularly believes thatimages arereal things; who mistakes reflections forwhat isreflected? Why doesSocrates insist that oursituation isthatofmenwhomistake images forrealities? Itwould seem more sensible tosaythatwetake objects tooseriously, thatwedonot recognize theimportance andsuperior reality ofthecauses orfirstprin- ciples.Howcan itbesaidthatwearebound tothelowest leveloftheline?

Legislators andpoets arethemakers ofthese horizons; or, tousethesymbols ofthecaveimage, they arethemenwhocarry the statues andtheother things thereflections ofwhich theprisoners see. These objects arenotnatural; they arethemselves images ofnatural ob- jectsproduced withcunning artsoastolook liketheir originals, but areadapted toserve thespecial interests ofthe artists. Inother words, wedonotseethings directly, butthrough theopinions wearetaught about them. Those opinions arenotaccurate reflections ofnature but areadapted toserve theneeds ofthecity.They aredesigned tomake a man love hiscity,andtherefore theyhave toinvest thecitywith all sortsofspecial significance andhavenobasis innature. Thetheoretical manwould notbelieve such opinions andwould, astheoretical man, havenoparticular concern forthem or,therefore, forthecitythey de- fend.Butthecitizens' world isalways amixture ofnature andconven- tion,andthat istheworld ofallofus.The firstandmost difficult of [404 ] Interpretive Essay tasks istheseparation ofwhat existsbynature fromwhat ismerely madebyman.Thepictures onthewallofovircavelookvery real,and thetwosources oftherepresentations areartfully intertwined. Weare attached totheillusion because itconstitutes ourownworld andgives meaning toourparticular existence. Philosophy orscience isconcerned onlywithman orthecity,not with thisparticular man orthisparticular city.Fewmen— andno cities— canlivewith thisperspective. Socrates illustrates thisintheac- count ofhisbeliefs andpractices givenbyXenophon {Memorabilia, I, i).Hewasinthehabit oftelling hisfriends that artorscience could teach amanhow tosowafieldwellorhow tobuild ahouse well,but it cannot tellhimwhether hewillreapwhat hehassown orliveinwhat hehasbuilt. Science isindifferent tothefateofindividuals. Those for whom this isintolerable need asupplement toreason; theymust turnto theDelphic oracle, tothedivine, inorder tosatisfy themselves. Thus ourloveofourown tiesustothecave,andthatpowerful passion must beovercome inorder tomoveupward onthelineofknowledge. And hewhodoesmust leave hiskin,beregarded asatraitor bythem, forego therewards offered tothemanwho joins intheir self-deception, and runtherisks ofpunishment prescribed bytheir laws. These arethe bonds which tieustothecaveand itsimages. Tobreak them requires rarepassion andcourage, forthelioninoursouls, spiritedness, guards thegates ofthedungeon. Thedivided lineandthecave teach thatthere aretwo fatal temptations ofthemind. The first isthatofthemenwho insist onthe significance oftheimages inthecaveandconstitute themselves astheir defenders andhence theaccusers ofthephilosophers. They areoften menofveryhigh intelligence whoareforced tohatereason bytheirun- willingness torenounce thecharm andsignificance oftheir particular experiences andthose oftheir people. They areenemies ofwhatever leads inthedirection ofuniversality, ofanything thatwould tend to breakdown theheterogeneity, theparticularity anddistinctiveness, of theways towhich they areattached. Their dominant trait ispiety, which frequently turns into fanaticism. These men areamong the leaders ofpeoples andareprotectors ofthepeople's beliefs. Thisaccount oftheirnature actsasacorrective oftheview thatthepeople caneasily bepersuaded toaccept philosophers askings. Theother great temptation isthat ofthosewho aretooeasily liberated anddonotlearn inthecavewhatmustbelearned aboutman andthesoul.Thesemendwell onthethird level
