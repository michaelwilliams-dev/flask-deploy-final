This generally carries over into our firstforaysinto society,aswebeginour careers. But aswegrow older the rebuffs and failures weexperiencesetupboundaries thatonly getfirmer with time. Comingtoexpect lessfrom theworld, weaccept limitations that arereally self-imposed.‘We start tobow andscrapeandapologizefor even thesimplest ofrequests.The solution Losuch ashrinking ofhorizons isto deliberately force ourselves intheoppositedirection-——to downplay the failures andignorethelimitations, tomake ourselves demand andexpect asmuch asthechild. Toaccomplish this,wemust use aparticular strategy upon ourselves. Call ittheStrategy oftheCrown. TheStrategyoftheCrown isbased on asimplechain ofcause and ef- fect:Ifwebelieve we aredestined forgreat things,ourbelief will radiate outward, justasacrown creates anaura around aking. This outward radi- ance willinfect thepeople around us,who willthink wemust have reasons tofeel soconfident. People who wear crowns seem tofeel noinner sense of thelimits towhat theycan askfor orwhat theycanaccomplish. This too radiates outward. Limits and boundaries disappear.Use theStrategyofthe Crown andyouwill besurprised how often itbears fruit. Take asanexa.m~ plethose happychildren who askforwhatever they want, andgetit.Their high expectationsaretheir charm. Adults enjoy grantingtheirwishes-——just asIsabella enjoyed grantingthewishes ofColumbus. Throughout history, peopleofundistinguished birth-—-the Theodora: of ‘Byzantium,theColumbuses, theBeethovens, theDisraelis-——-have managed towork theStrategyoftheCrown, believingsofirmly intheir own greatness thatitbecomes aseIf~fulfil1ing prophecy.The trick issimple: Beovercome byyourselfibelief.

The crown may separate you from other people, butitisuptoyouto make thatseparationreal: You have toactdifferently, demonstrating your distance from those aroundyou.One waytoemphasize yourdifference is toalwaysactwithdignity,nomatter thecircumstance. Louis~Philippe gave nosense ofbeing different from other people—hewas thebanker king. And the moment hissubjectsthreatened him, hecaved in.Everyone sensed this andpounced. Lacking regal dignityand firmness ofpurpose, Louis-Philippeseemed animpostor,and the crown was easily toppled from hishead. Regal bearingshould notbeconfused with arrogance.

Attheageoffourteen, Tafari went tolive atthecourt, where heimme— diately impressed Menelik and became hisfavorite. Tafarfs grace under fire, hispatience, and hiscalm selflassurance fascinated theking. The other young nobles, arrogant, blustery,and envious, would pushthisslight, bookish teenager around. Buthenever gotangry-—-thatwould have been a sign ofinsecurity,towhich hewould notstoop.There were already people around him who felthewould somedayrise tothetop,forheacted asifhe were already there. Years later, in1936, when theItalian Fascists had taken over Ethiopia andTafari, now called Haile Selassie, wasinexile, headdressed theLeague ofNations topleadhiscountry’scase. The Italians intheaudience heckled him with vulgar abuse, but hemaintained hisdignified pose,asifcom- pletely unaffected. This elevated him while making hisopponentslook even uglier.
