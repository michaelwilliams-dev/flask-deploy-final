fatigue which it would entail on the men. P�ei Hsing- chien, however, paid no heed to their remonstrances and had the camp moved as quickly as possible. The same night, a terrific storm came on, which flooded their former place of encampment to the depth of over twelve feet. The recalcitrant officers were amazed at the sight, and owned that they had been in the wrong. �How did you know what was going to happen?� they asked. P�ei Hsing-chien replied: �From this time forward be content to obey orders without asking unnecessary questions.� From this it may be seen," Chang Yu continues, "that high and sunny places are advantageous not only for fighting, but also because they are immune from disastrous floods."] 1. If the enemy has occupied them before you, do not follow him, but retreat and try to entice him away. [The turning point of Li Shih-min�s campaign in 621 A.D. against the two rebels, Tou Chien-te, King of Hsia, and Wang Shih-ch�ung, Prince of Cheng, was his seizure of the heights of Wu-lao, in spike of which Tou Chien-te persisted in his attempt to relieve his ally in Lo-yang, was defeated and taken prisoner. See CHIU T�ANG, ch. 2, fol. 5 verso, and also ch. 54.] 1. If you are situated at a great distance from the enemy, and the strength of the two armies is equal, it is not easy to provoke a battle, [The point is that we must not think of undertaking a long and wearisome march, at the end of which, as Tu Yu says, "we should be exhausted and our adversary fresh and keen."] and fighting will be to your disadvantage. 1. These six are the principles connected with Earth. [Or perhaps, "the principles relating to ground." See, however, I. ss. 8.] CHAPTER 11. TERRAIN 89 The general who has attained a responsible post must be careful to study them. 1. Now an army is exposed to six several calamities, not arising from natural causes, but from faults for which the general is responsible. These are: 1. Flight; 2. insubordination; 3. collapse; 4. ruin; 5. disorganization; 6. rout. 2. Other conditions being equal, if one force is hurled against another ten times its size, the result will be the FLIGHT of the former. 3. When the common soldiers are too strong and their officers too weak, the result is INSUBORDINATION. [Tu Mu cites the unhappy case of T�ien Pu [HSIN T�ANG SHU, ch. 148], who was sent to Wei in 821 A.D. with orders to lead an army against Wang T�ing-ts�ou. But the whole time he was in command, his soldiers treated him with the utmost contempt, and openly flouted his authority by riding about the camp on donkeys, several thousands at a time. T�ien Pu was powerless to put a stop to this conduct, and when, after some months had passed, he made an attempt to engage the enemy, his troops turned tail and dispersed in every direction. After that, the
