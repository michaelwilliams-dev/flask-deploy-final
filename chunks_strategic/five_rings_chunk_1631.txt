OBSERVANCES OFTHE LAW Observance I InMayof1925, fiveofthe most successful dealers intheFrench scrap metal business found themselves invited toan“official” but“highlyconfi- dential” meetingwith thedeputy director generaloftheMinistry ofPost andTelegraphsattheHotel Criilon, then themost luxurious hotel inParis. When thebusinessmen arrived, itwas thedirector general himself, aMon- sieur Lustig, who met them inaswank suite onthetopfloor. The businessmen had noideawhy theyhad been summoned tothis meeting,andtheywere burstingwithcuriosity.After drinks, thedirector explained. “Gentlemen,” hesaid, “this isanurgentmatter that requires complete secrecy.The government isgoingtohave totear down theEiffel Tower.” The dealers listened instunned silence asthedirector explained that thetower, asrecently reportedinthe news, desperatelyneeded re pairs. Ithadoriginallybeen meant asatemporarystructure (fortheExpo» sition of1889), itsmaintenance costs had soared over theyears,and now, inatime ofafiscal crisis, thegovernment would have tospendmillions to fixit.ManyParlsians considered theEiffel Tower aneyesoreand would be delightedtoseeitgo.Over time, even thetourists would forgetabout it—it would live oninphotographsand postcards. “Gentlemen,” Lustig said, “youareallinvited tomake thegovernmentanoffer fortheEiffel Tower.” Hegavethebusinessmen sheets ofgovernment stationery filled with figures,such asthetonnage ofthetower’s metal. Theireyespoppedasthey calculated how much theycould make from thescrap. Then Lustigled them toawaiting limo, which broughtthem totheEiffel Tower. Flashing anofficial badge,heguidedthem throughthe area, spicinghistour with amusinganecdotes. Attheend ofthevisit bethanked them and asked them tohave their offers delivered tohissuite within four days. Several daysafter theoffers were submitted, one ofthefive, aMon- sieur P.,received notice that hisbid was thewinner, and that tosecure the saleheshould come tothesuite atthehotel within twodays, bearingacer- tified check for more than 250,000 francs (theequivalent today ofabout $1,000,000)--—a quarter ofthetotal price. Ondelivery ofthecheck, he would receive thedocuments confirminghisownership oftheEiffel Tower. Monsieur P.was excited—-he wouldgodown inhistoryasthe man who hadbought and torn down theinfamous landmark. Butbythetime he ar- rived atthesuite, check inhand, he wasbeginningtohave doubts about thewhole affair. Whymeet inahotel instead ofagovernment building? Whyhadrft heheard from other offieials?
