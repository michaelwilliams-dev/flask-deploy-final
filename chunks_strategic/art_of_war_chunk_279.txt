opportunity to ask, �When you had the enemy on the run, you left your infantry and rode right up to the city ramparts without even taking any siege equipment. We were all in doubt as to whether we could take the city, yet you did�how?� The Tang founder said, �The men under the command of the Sui warlord�s general are all outsiders, people from a completely different region. Although our army beat them, we didn�t kill or capture too many. If we gave them time, they would all go into the city, where the warlord would take them in and treat them as his own�then they would not be easy to overcome. I knew that if we pressured them, the soldiers would all run away back to their homeland, leaving no one here to fight for the warlord. �The warlord�s spirit is broken with mortal terror; that is why he surrendered, out of fear.� Not Fighting Liu Ji said: When opponents in warfare outnumber you, or they are more powerful than you are, or when you are at a tactical disadvantage, or when they have come from far away but still have supplies, in any of these cases it will not do to fight with them. It is best to fortify your defenses and hold them off long enough to wear them down to the point of vulnerability. The rule is �It is up to you not to fight� (�Dialogues of Li, Lord of Wei�).

What do you think?� The younger warrior replied, �The thrust of this band of rebels is not to be met directly. They will be easy to foil by strategy, hard to contend with by strength. Let us secure our position so as to blunt their edge. They are a rag-tag mob and cannot last long. When their supplies start to run out, they will disperse by themselves. We can capture them without even fighting.� The Tang founder said, �Your perception accords with mine.� As it turned out, the Sui fighters fled by night when their food ran out. The Tang army chased them into the next country and put them to flight in one skirmish. Avoiding Battle Liu Ji said: When you are at war with strong enemies, at first their energy is keen, while your momentum is
