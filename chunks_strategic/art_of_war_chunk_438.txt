of the simile of energy and the force stored up in the bent cross- bow until released by the finger on the trigger.] 16. Amid the turmoil and tumult of battle, there may be seeming disorder and yet no real disorder at all; amid confusion and chaos, your array may be without head or tail, yet it will be proof against defeat. [Mei Yao-ch�en says: "The subdivisions of the army having been previ- ously fixed, and the various signals agreed upon, the separating and join- ing, the dispersing and collecting which will take place in the course of a battle, may give the appearance of disorder when no real disorder is pos- sible. Your formation may be without head or tail, your dispositions all topsy-turvy, and yet a rout of your forces quite out of the question."] 17. Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline, simulated fear postulates courage; simulated weakness postulates strength. [In order to make the translation intelligible, it is necessary to tone down the sharply paradoxical form of the original. Ts�ao Kung throws out a hint of the meaning in his brief note: "These things all serve to destroy formation and conceal one�s condition." But Tu Mu is the first to put it quite plainly: "If you wish to feign confusion in order to lure the enemy on, you must first have perfect discipline; if you wish to display timidity in order to entrap the enemy, you must have extreme courage; if you wish to parade your weakness in order to make the enemy over-confident, you must have exceeding strength."] 18. Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a question of subdi- vision; [See supra, ss. 1.] concealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of latent energy; [The commentators strongly understand a certain Chinese word here dif- ferently than anywhere else in this chapter. Thus Tu Mu says: "seeing that we are favorably circumstanced and yet make no move, the enemy will believe that we are really afraid."] masking strength with weakness is to be effected by tactical dispositions. [Chang Yu relates the following anecdote of Kao Tsu, the first Han Em- peror: "Wishing to crush the Hsiung-nu, he sent out spies to report on their condition. But the Hsiung-nu, forewarned, carefully concealed all their able-bodied men and well-fed horses, and only allowed infirm sol- diers and emaciated cattle to be seen. The result was that spies one and CHAPTER 6. ENERGY 51 all recommended the Emperor to deliver his attack. Lou Ching alone op- posed them, saying: "When two countries go to war, they are naturally inclined to make an ostentatious display of their strength. Yet our spies have seen nothing but old age and infirmity. This is surely some ruse on the part of the enemy, and it would be unwise for us to attack." The Emperor, however, disregarding this advice, fell into the trap and found himself surrounded at Po-teng."] 19. Thus one who is skillful at keeping the enemy on
