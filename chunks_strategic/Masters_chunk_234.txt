Going through volume after volume, readers would have the sensation that they were actually living and experiencing this world from within, the narrator�s thoughts becoming one�s own thoughts�the boundaries between narrator and reader disappearing. It was a magical effect; it felt like life itself. Straining to finish the final volume, the point at which the narrator would be finally able to write the novel we have been reading, Proust was in a hurry.

For the pianist Glenn Gould, he no longer had to focus on notes or parts of the music he was playing, but instead saw the entire architecture of the piece and could express it. Albert Einstein suddenly was able to realize not just the answer to a problem, but a whole new way of looking at the universe, contained in a visual image he intuited.
