as well." Mei Yao-ch�en explains that this "artful appointment" is to be made through the medium of the enemy�s own spies, who will carry back just the amount of information that we choose to give them. Then, having cunningly disclosed our intentions, "we must manage, though start- ing after the enemy, to arrive before him (VII. ss. 4). We must start after him in order to ensure his marching thither; we must arrive before him in order to capture the place without trouble. Taken thus, the present passage lends some support to Mei Yao-ch�en�s interpretation of ss. 47.] 1. Walk in the path defined by rule, [Chia Lin says: "Victory is the only thing that matters, and this cannot be achieved by adhering to conventional canons." It is unfortunate that this variant rests on very slight authority, for the sense yielded is certainly much more satisfactory. Napoleon, as we know, according to the veterans of the old school whom he defeated, won his battles by violating every accepted canon of warfare.] and accommodate yourself to the enemy until you can fight a decisive battle. [Tu Mu says: "Conform to the enemy�s tactics until a favorable opportun- ity offers; then come forth and engage in a battle that shall prove decis- ive."] 1.

CHAPTER 12. THE NINE SITUATIONS 114 [As the hare is noted for its extreme timidity, the comparison hardly ap- pears felicitous. But of course Sun Tzu was thinking only of its speed. The words have been taken to mean: You must flee from the enemy as quickly as an escaping hare; but this is rightly rejected by Tu Mu.] Chapter 13 THE ATTACK BY FIRE [Rather more than half the chapter (SS. 1-13) is devoted to the subject of fire, after which the author branches off into other topics.] 1. Sun Tzu said: There are five ways of attacking with fire. The first is to burn soldiers in their camp; [So Tu Mu. Li Ch�uan says: "Set fire to the camp, and kill the soldiers" (when they try to escape from the flames). Pan Ch�ao, sent on a diplomatic mission to the King of Shan-shan [see XI. ss. 51, note], found himself placed in extreme peril by the unexpected arrival of an envoy from the Hsiung-nu [the mortal enemies of the Chinese]. In consultation with his officers, he exclaimed: "Never venture, never win! 1 The only course open to us now is to make an assault by fire on the barbarians under cover of night, when they will not be able to discern our numbers. Profiting by their panic, we shall exterminate them completely; this will cool the King�s courage and cover us with glory, besides ensuring the success of our mission.� the officers all replied that it would be necessary to
