OBSERVANCE OFTHE LAW inA.D.225, Chuko Liang, master strategistand chief minister totheruler ofShu inancient China, confronted adangerous situation. Thekingdomof Wei had mounted anall~out attack onShu from thenorth. More dangerous still, Wei had formed analliance with thebarbarous states tothesouth of Shu, ledbyKing Menghuo.Chuko Lianghad todeal with this second menace from thesouth before hecould hopetofend offWei inthenorth. AsChuko Liang preparedtomarch south against thebarbarians, a wise man inhiscampoffered him advice. Itwould beimpossible,this man said, topacifytheregion byforce. Lizmg would probablybeat Menghuo, but assoon asheheaded north again todeal with Wei, Menghuowould reinvade. “Itisbetter towinhearts," said thewise man, “than cities; better tobattle with hearts than withweapons. Ihope youwill succeed inwinning thehearts ofthese people.” “You readmythoughts,” respondedChuko Liang. AsLiang expected, Menghuolaunched a.powerful atm ButLiang laid atrapandmanagedtocapturealarge part ofMenghuds army,includ- ingthekinghimself. Instead ofpunishingorexecutinghisprisoners,how- ever, heseparatedthesoldiers from their king,hadtheir shackles removed, regaled them with food and wine, and then addressed them. “You areall upright men,” hesaid. “Ibelieveyouallhaveparents, wives, and children waiting foryouathome. Theyaredoubtless sheddingbitter tears atyour fate. Iamgoingtorelease you,sothatyoucan return home toyour loved ones and comfort them.” The men thanked Liang with tears intheireyes; then hesent forMenghuo. “If 1release you,”askedLiang,“what willyou do?” “Iwillpull myarmy together again,”answered theking, “and lead it against youtoadecisive battle. Butifyou captureme asecond time, Iwill bow toyour superiority.”Notonly didLiangorder Menghuo released, he gave him agiftofahorse and saddle. Whenangrylieutenants wondered why hedidthis,Liangtoldthem, “Icancapturethat man aseasilyasIcan takesomething outofmypocket. Iamtryingtowin hisheart. When Ido, peace will come ofitself here inthesouth.” AsMenghuohad said hewould, heattacked again. Buthis own offi- cers, whom Lianghad treated sowell, rebelled against him, captured him, and turned him over toLiang,who asked him again the same questionas before. Menghuo repliedthat hehad notbeen beaten fairly,butmerelybe- trayed byhisown officers; hewould fight again, butifcapturedathird time hewould bow toLiang’s superiority. Over thefollowingmonths Liangoutwitted Menghuo again andagain, capturinghim athird, afourth, and afifth time. Oneach occasionMeng— huo’s troops grew more dissatisfied. Liang had treated them withrespect; theyhad losttheir heart forfighting.Buteverytime Chuko Liang asked Menghuotoyield,thegreat king would comeupwith another excuse: You tricked me,Ilostthroughbadluck, onand on.Ifyou capturemeagain, hewould promise,Iswear Iwill notbetray you.And soLiang would let himgo. When hecaptured Menghuo forthesixth time, heasked theking the same question again. “Ifyou captureme aseventh time,” theking replied, “Ishall give you myloyaltyand never rebel again.” “Very well,” said Liang.“But ifIcapture youagain, Iwill notrelease you.” Now Menghuo and hissoldiers fled toafarcorner oftheir kingdom, theregion ofWuge. Defeated somany times, Menghuo hadonlyonehope left:Hewould askthehelp ofKing Wutugu ofWuge,who had animmense and ferociousarmy. Wutugu’s warriors wore anarmor oftightlywoven vines soaked inoil, then dried to animpenetrablehardness. With Menghuoathisside, Wutugumarched thismighty army against Liang, and thistime thegreat strategist seemed frightened, leading his men inahur- ried relreat. But he wasmerely
