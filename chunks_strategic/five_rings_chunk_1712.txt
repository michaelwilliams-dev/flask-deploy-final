secretly wishingtheboywillfail, as Philiphalf wanted toseeAlexander thrown from Bucephalus. Fathers envy their sons’ youthandvigor,after all,andtheir desire istocontrol and dom- inate. The sons ofsuch men tend tobecome cowed andcautious, terrified oflosingwhat their fathers have gained. The sonwill neverstepoutofhisfather’s shadow unless headopts the ruthless strategy ofAlexander: disparage thepast,createyourown king- dom, putthefather intheshadows instead ofletting him dothe same to you. Ifyoucannot materiallystart from groundzero—--it would befoolish torenounce aninheritance-—youcan atleast begin from groundzeropsy- chologically, bythrowing offtheweight ofthepastandchartinganew di— rection. Alexander instinctively recognized thatprivileges ofbirth are impedimentstopower.Bemerciless with thepast, then——not onlywith your father and hisfather butwith yourown earlier achievements. Only theweak rest ontheir laurels and dote onpasttriumphs;inthegame of powerthere isnever time torest KEYS TOPOWER Inmany ancient kingdoms,forexample Bengal and Sumatra, after the kinghad ruled forseveralyears hissubjectswould execute him. This was done partlyasaritual ofrenewal, butalso toprevent him from growingtoo powerful—for theking would generally trytoestablish apermanent order, attheexpense ofother families and ofhis own sons. Instead ofprotecting thetribe andleadingitintimes ofwar, hewould attempttodominate it. And sohewould bebeaten todeath, orexecuted inanelaborate ritual. Now that he was nolonger around forhis h0l101‘S togotohishead, he could beworshippedasagod.Meanwhile thefield had been cleared for a new andyouthfulorder toestablish itself. The ambivalent, hostile attitude towards thekingorfather figure also finds expressioninlegends ofheroes who donotknow their father. Moses, thearchetypalman ofpower,was found abandoned among thebulrushes and never knew hisparents;without a.father tocompetewith him orlimit him, hecould attain theheights ofpower.Hercules had noearthlyfather—— hewas the sonofthegod Zeus. Later inhislifeAlexander theGreat spread thestorythat thegodJupiterAmmon had sired him, notPhilip ofMace- don. Legends and rituals like these eliminate thehuman father because he symbolizesthedestructivepower ofthepast. The past prevents theyoung hero from creating his own world--he must do ashisfather did, even after that father isdead orpowerless. The hero must how andscrapebefore hispredecessor andyieldtotradition andprecedent.What had success inthepastmust becarried over tothe present,even though circumstances have greatly changed.Thepastalso weighs thehero down with aninheritance that heisterrified oflosing, makinghim timid and cautious. Power dependsontheabilitytofill avoid, tooccupyafield that has been cleared ofthedead weight ofthepast. Only after thefather figure has beenproperlydoneawaywith willyouhave thenecessary spacetocreate andestablish anew order. There areseveral strategies youcanadopttoac- complishthis—-——varia!ions ontheexecution oftheking thatdisguise the vio~ lence oftheimpulse bychannelingitinsocially acceptable forms.

Kennedy, forinstance, would notplaythedull andfatherly game ofgolf—— asymbolofretirement andprivilege,andEisenhowefs passion. Instead he playedfootball ontheWhite House lawn. Inevery aspecthisadministra- tionrepresented vigor andyouth,asopposedtothestodgy Eisenhower. Kennedyhad discovered anoldtruth: Theyoungareeasilysetagainst the old,since they yearntomake their own placeintheworld and resent the shadow oftheir fathers. The distance youestablish fromyour predecessor often demands some symbolism,awayofadvertising itself publicly.Louis XIV, for exam- ple,created such symbolism when herejectedthetraditional palace ofthe French kings and built his own palace ofVersailles. King PhilipIIofSpain didthe same when hecreated hiscenter ofpower,thepalaceofElEsco- rial,inwhat was then themiddle ofnowhere. But Louis carried thegame further: Hewould not be akinglike hisfather orearlier ancestors, he would not wear acrown orcarryascepterorsiton athrone, hewould es- tablish anew kind ofimposing authoritywith symbols and
