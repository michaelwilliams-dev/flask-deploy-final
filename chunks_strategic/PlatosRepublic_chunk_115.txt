the spirited, by nature an auxiliary to the calculating part, if ifs not corrupted by bad rearing?" "Necessarily," he said, "there is the third." "Yes," I said, "if it should come to light as something other than the calculating part, just as it has come to light as different from the desiring part." "But ifs not hard," he said, "for it to come to light as such. For, even in little children, one could see that they are full of spirit straight from birth, while, as for calculating, some seem to me never to get a share of it, and the many do so quite late." "Yes, by Zeus," I said, "what you have said is fine. Moreover, in beasts one could see that what you say is so. And to them can be added the testimony of Homer that we cited in that other place somewhere earlier, He smote his breast and reproached his heart with word.. _32 c Here, you see, Homer clearly presents that which has calculated about better and worse and rebukes that which is irrationally spirited as though it were a different part." "What you say is entirely correct," he said. 441 "Well," I said, "we've had a hard swim through that and pretty much agreed that the same classes that are in the city are in the soul of each one severally and that their number is equal." "Yes, that's so." "Isn't it by now necessary that the private man be wise in the same way and because of the same thing as the city was wise?'' "Of course."

"Moreover, we surely haven't forgotten that this city was just be? cause each of the three classes in it minds its own business." "We haven't in my opinion forgotten," he said. "Then we must remember that, for each of us too, the one within whom each of the parts minds its own business will be just and mind his own business." "Indeed," he said, "that must be remembered." "Isn't it proper for the calculating part to rule, since it is wise and has forethought about all of the soul, and for the spirited part to be obedient to it and its ally?'' ï¿½ "Certainly." "So, as we were saying, won't a mixture of music and gymnastic make them accordant, tightening the one and training it in fair speeches and learning, while relaxing the other with soothing tales, 442 taming it by harmony and rhythm?" "Quite so," he said. "And these two, thus trained and having truly learned their own business and been educated, will be set
