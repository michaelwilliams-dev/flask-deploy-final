Suddenly sentinels hurried inwith thealarmingnews that an enemy force ofover 150,000 troopsunder Sima Yiwasapproaching.With onlyahundred men todefend him, Chuko Liang’ssituation washopeless. The enemy would finally capture thisrenowned leader. Without lamenting hisfate, orwastingtime tryingtofigureouthow he had been caught, Liang ordered histroopstotake down their flags, throw open thecitygates, and hide. Hehimself then took aseat onthe most visi- blepart ofthecity’s wall, wearingaTaoist robe. Helitsome incense, strummed hislute, andbegantochant. Minutes later hecould seethe vast enemy army approaching,anendless phalanxofsoldiers. Pretendingnot tonotice them, hecontinued tosing andplaythelute. Soon thearmystood atthetown gates, Atitshead was Sima Yi,who instantly recognized the man onthewall. Even so, ashissoldiers itched toenter theunguardedtown throughits open gates, Sima Yihesitated, held them back, and studied Liangonthe wall. Then, heordered animmediate andspeedyretreat.

Grate fulandterrified, the man agreed, andbegan supplyingfalse information to theenemy. Liangwon battle after battle. Onanother occasion Liang stole amilitaryseal and created false docu- mentsdispatchinghisenemy’s troopstodistant locations.
