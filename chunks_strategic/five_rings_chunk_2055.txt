(TheGreek word bolecanmean either throwing, orhitting themark.) 41.Thewordnomima, which usually means "thecustomary orlawful," isaderivative ofnomos. Here popular, unsure opinion isidentified with the opinion supported bycivil society. 42.Cf432d. BookVI 1.Socrates, indiscussion with theerotic Glaucon, usesanambiguous sentence. Itcould alsobetranslated: "...amanwho isbynature inlovewith something cares foreverything related totheobject ofhislove." Socrates wish- esGlaucon totake itasitappears inthetext, or,atleast,hewishes theover- tones ofthatsense toaffect Glaucon's response. Socrates himself means the question inthesecond sense. However, therelation between thesexual love directed toward human beings andtheloveofwisdom isnottobeforgotten. Socrates constantly useswords with asexual ormilitary connotation inspeak- ingtoGlaucon, thuspredisposing him tocertain answers byappealing tohis particular passions. 2.TheGreek word ismegaloprepeia andmeans literally "thatwhich is fitting orseemly foragreat man." 3.Cf.390e, note 31.

They gavemechanical ac- counts ofthemovements oftheheavens, denied thattheSunandtheMoon are gods, etc.They sought outwhat should beleftinviolate. Intheaccusation of Socrates heavy weight wasgiven totheallegation thathestudied theheavens; itisnotcasual that thisspeech ispresented asanapology. 7.According toAristotle {Rhetoric, II,16),Simonides wasaskedbythe tyrant Hiero's wifewhether hewould prefer tobewise orrich. "Rich," he answered, "for Iseethatthewisespend their time atthedoors oftherich." The Scholiast says thatSocrates himself made thestatement andexplained that this isbecause wisemenknow theirown needs. 8.TheGreek word means "false accusation" or"gossip." What is implied isthekind ofmalicious talkthatgoesaround inthecityabout some- onewith abadreputation. 9.Theterminology isthatoflove, procreation, andchildbirth. 10.Thereference istothechorus employed intragedy andcomedy. Soc- rates treats thecharacteristics ofthesoul asthough theywere theactors in thedramatic poems produced bythecityforthepublic festivals, andactsas though hewere their trainer ordirector. 11.Cf412e, note 64. 12.Theprecise meaning ofthisexpression isnotcertainly known, but there aretwo stories thatmight explain it. (a)After Odysseus andDiomede stole thePalladium fromTroy onenight, Odysseus, inorder tohave theglory oftheachievement forhimself, attempted tokillDiomede. Diomede sawtheshadow ofOdysseus' sword inthelight of themoon andturned onhim.Hebound Odysseus' hands anddrove himtothe Greek camp ahead ofhim,covering hisback withblows from the flatofhis sword. (b)There wasaThracian named Diomede whose daughters were prostitutes. Heforced thestrangers whocame tohim tohave intercourse withthem, and then killed thestrangers (cfAristophanes, Ecclesiazusae, 1029). The Aris- tophanes passage indicates thatthelatter story istheonereferred tohere. 13.There isaseries ofpuns hereonthegenitive oftheGreek word nous, "mind" or"intelligence" (cf.614bandnote 13).SethBenardete sug- gests that thisclause betranslated:".. .with pretentions andconceits of naughts fraught with thoughtlessness." 14.Thesentence isincomplete; Socrates, about tointroduce theimage, stops todevelop thecomparison andthen asks forhisinterlocutor's agreement before continuing theoriginal thought. 15.Socrates plays onthewords foraworker inbronze, orablacksmith, andmoney {argurioti, which issilver) and calls tomind themetals ofthetwo lower classes inthecity (4151>-c). Thewords "released" {lelymenou) and [462 ] Notes/ HOOK VI "bathed" (lehimenou) arepractically thesame, andthephrase forms alittle jingle. 16.Asophism isaclever trick orcaptious argument; itistheproduct of a"wise guy."'Themaker ofasophism would beasophist. 17.Theaccent inthisword isonthecareofills,perhaps ontheover- attentiveness tothem (cf.407b). 18.Da/?jJon/on— "oforbelonging toademon" (cf382e, note 55).For Socrates' daimonion seeApology, 3Id;Theaetetus, 151a; Theages, 128e; Xenophon, Memorabilia, i,4. 19.Logoi (cf334a, note 25). 20.Heracleitus, according toAristotle, said: "...every daythesun is new" (Aristotle, Meteorologica, ii,2.9). 21.These areterms used intheartofrhetoric; inthesentence which begins, "Fortheynever saw. ..,"there isaparody ofthese
