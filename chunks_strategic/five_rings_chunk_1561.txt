Hsiang hurriedly marched onHsien-yang,this time determined tohack offhisrival’s head. Liu was never one tofight when theodds were against him, and heabandoned thecity.Hsiang cap~ tured Hsien-yang,murdered theyoung prince ofCh’in, and burned the citytotheground. Liu was now Hsiang’s bitterenemy,and hepursued him formany months, finally corneringhim inawalled city.Lacking food, hisarmyindisarray,Liu sued forpeace. AgainFanTsengwamedHsiang,“Crush him now! Ifyoulethim go again, you will besorrylater.” ButHsiang decided tobemerciful. He wanted tobringLiuback toCh’u alive, and toforce hisformer friend toac- knowledge him asmaster. But Fanproved right: Liumanagedtousethe negotiations forhissurrender asadistraction, and heescapedwith asmall army. Hsiang, amazed that hehad yetagain lethisrival slip away,once more setoutafter Liu, thistime with such ferocity that heseemed tohave lost hismind. Atonepoint, having captured Liu’s father inbattle, Hsiang stood theold manupduringthefighting andyelled toLiu across thelineof troops,“Surrender now, orIshall boil yourfather alive!” Liucalmlyarr swered, “But we are sworn brothers. Somyfather isyour father also. Ifyou insist onboiling yourown father, send me abowl ofthesoup!” Hsiang backed down, and thestrugglecontinued. Afew weeks later, inthethick ofthehunt, Hsiang scattered hisforces unwisely,and inasurpriseattack Liu was able tosurround hismain garri- son. Forthefirst time thetables were turned. Now itwasHsiangwho sued forpeace.Liu’s topadviser urgedhim todestroy Hsiang,crush hisarmy, show nomercy.“Tolethimgowould belikerearingatiger——it willdevour youlater,” theadviser said. Liuagreed. Makingafalse treaty, helured Hsiarig intorelaxinghisdefense, then slaughteredalmost allofhisarmy. Hsiang managedtoescape. Alone and onfoot, knowingthatLiuhadputabountyonhishead, hecame upona smallgroup ofhis own retreating soldiers, and cried out, “Ihear LiuPang hasoffered one thousandpiecesofgoldand afiefoftenthousand families formyhead. Let medoyouafavor.” Then heslithis own throat and died. Interpretation Hsiang Yuhad proven hisruthlessness onmanyanoccasion. Herarely hesitated indoing away with arival ifitserved hispurposes. Butwith Liu Pangheacted differently. Herespectedhisrival, and didnotwant todefeat himthrough deception;hewanted toprovehissuperiorityonthebattle field, even toforce theclever Liu tosurrender and toserve him. Everytime hehad hisrival inhishands, somethingmade him hesitat&——a fatalsympa~ thywith orrespect forthe man who, after all,had once been afriend and comrade inarms. Butthemoment Hsiang made itclear that heintended to doaway with Liu, yetfailed toaccomplish it,hesealed hisown doom. Liu would notsuffer the same hesitation once thetables were tamed. This isthefate that faces allofuswhen wesympathize with our ene mics, when pity,orthehope ofreconciliation, makes uspull back from doing away with them. Weonly strengthentheir fear and hatred ofus.We have beaten them, andtheyarehumiliated; yetwenurture these resentful viperswho will onedaykill us.Power cannot bedealt with thisway. It must beexterrninated, crushed, and denied thechance toreturn tohaunt us.This isallthetruer with aformer friend who has become anenemy.
