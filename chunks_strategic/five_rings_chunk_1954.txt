"And, therefore, when oneoftheother parts gets control, the result isthat itcan't discover itsowtipleasure andcompels theothers topursue analienanduntrue pleasure." "That's so,"hesaid. "Doesn't what ismost distant fromphilosophy andargument pro- duce such results?" "By far." "And iswhat ismost distant fromlawandorder most distant fromargument?" "Plainly." "And didn't theerotic andtyrannic desires come tolight asmost distant?" "By far." "And thekingly andorderly ones least distant?" "Yes." "Then Isuppose thetyrant willbemost distant from apleasure that istrueand isproperly hisowti, while theking isleast distant." "Necessarily." "And therefore," Isaid, "the tyrant will livemost unpleasantly andthekingmost pleasantly." "Quite necessarily." "Doyouknow," Isaid,"howmuch more unpleasant thetyrant's life isthan theking's?"

"How?" hesaid. "The tyrant, ofcourse, stood third from theoligarchic man; the man ofthepeople wasbetween them." "Yes." "Then wouldn't hedwell with aphantom ofpleasure thatwith respect totruth isthird from that other, ifwhatwent before istrue?" "That's so." "And theoligarchic man isinhisturn third from thekingly man, d ifwecount thearistocratic andthekingly man asthesame." "Yes,heisthird." "Therefore," Isaid, "atyrant isremoved from truepleasure bya number that isthree times three." "Itlooks like it."

"Butthen itbecomes clearhow great thedistance ofseparation is onthebasis ofthesquare andthecube." "It's clear," hesaid, "totheman skilled incalculation."
