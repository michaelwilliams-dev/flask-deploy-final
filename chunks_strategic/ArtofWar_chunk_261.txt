Kingdoms, the warlord general Cao Cao of Wei sent one of his generals to be the military governor of a border area. This Wei general garrisoned his troops there, making many rice fields. He also sent secret agents into the kingdom of Wu to the south, to invite the cooperation of a group of dissidents within that kingdom. One of the leading generals of Wu said, �The land where the Wei army is garrisoned is very fertile. Once they harvest a crop of rice there, their numbers will surely increase. If this goes on for a few years, Cao Cao will be hard to stop. We should get rid of them as soon as possible.� So the Wu general made a report on these conditions to the king of Wu, who then personally went on the expedition against Cao Cao�s garrison. The Wu forces got there in a day and a night. The king asked his generals about strategy, and they all suggested making a high fortification, which they said could with effort be built rapidly. But the leading Wu general said, �They have already fortified the city they occupy, and reinforcements are sure to be arriving, making it impossible to get at them. Now the rains are starting, and we should take this opportunity to attack; for if we stay a few days we will surely return exhausted, and the roads back will be difficult. I think that would be dangerous. �Now as I see this city, it is not all that secure. If we attack it on four sides while our armed forces are at their keenest, the Wei occupation army can be thrown out in a short time, and we can get back home before the rivers swell. This is the way to complete victory.� The king of Wu followed this advice. The Wu forces staged an allout attack on the city and very soon overthrew the Wei occupation. The leader of the Wei reinforcements was on the road when he heard the news that the city had fallen, and he promptly withdrew on learning of Wei�s defeat. As for the Wu general who had recommended this successful course of action, the king of Wu rewarded him for his achievement, making him military governor of the area. Defense and Battle Liu Ji said: In warfare, the defender is the one who knows himself. If you know you have no reasonable chance of winning, then for the time being stay firmly on the defensive, waiting for a time when the adversary can be beaten. If you wait for the right time to attack, you will always win. The rule is �Invincibility is a matter of defense� (Sun Tzu, The Art of War, �Formation�). Around the middle of the second century B.C.E., during the reign of the fourth- generation emperor of the Han dynasty, seven states�Wu, Chu, and five others �rebelled against imperial authority and tried to secede from the empire. The emperor appointed one of his distinguished generals
