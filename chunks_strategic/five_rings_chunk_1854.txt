"Most certainly," saidAdeimantus. "But, Socrates, what doyou notice intheinvestigation ofthejust that's likethis?" t "I'll tellyou," Isaid."There is,wesay,justice ofoneman; and there is,surely, justice ofawhole citytoo?" "Certainly," hesaid. "Isacitybigger^^ thanoneman?" "Yes, itisbigger;" hesaid. "Sothen,perhaps therewould bemore justice inthebigger and it would beeasier toobserve closely. Ifyouwant, firstwe'll investigate what justice islike inthecities. Then, we'll alsogoontoconsider itin 369a individuals, considering thelikeness ofthebigger inthe ideaP-'^ ofthe littler?" "What yousayseems finetome,"hesaid. "Ifweshould watch acitycoming intobeing inspeech," Isaid, "would wealsosee itsjustice coming intobeing, and itsinjustice?" "Probably," hesaid. "When thishasbeen done, canwehope toseewhat we're looking formore easily?" h "Farmore easily." "Is itresolved^s thatwemust trytocarry thisout? Isuppose it's nosmall job,soconsider it." "It'sbeen considered," saidAdeimantus. "Don't doanything else." "Well, then," Isaid, "acity, asIbelieve, comes intobeing be- [45 ] socrates/adeimantus therepublic 369b cause each ofusisn't self-sufficient but isinneed ofmuch. Doyou believe there's another beginning tothefounding ofacity?" "None atall,"hesaid. c "So, then, when oneman takes onanother, foroneneed and another foranother need, and, sincemany things areneeded, many men gather inonesettlement aspartners andhelpers, tothiscommon settlement wegivethename city, don'twe?" "Most certainly." "Now, doesoneman give ashare toanother, ifhedoes give a share, ortakeashare, inthebelief that it'sbetter forhimself?" "Certainly." "Come, now," Isaid, "let'smake acityinspeech from thebegin- ning.Ourneed, asitseems, willmake it." "Ofcourse." d "Well, now, the firstandgreatest ofneeds istheprovision offood forexisting andliving." "Certainly." "Second, ofcourse, ishousing, andthird, clothing, andsuch." "That's so." "Now wait," Isaid."How willthecitybesufficient toprovide for thismuch?

"The cityofutmost necessity^^ would bemade offour orfive men." e "Itlooks like it."

AndAdeimantus said, "Perhaps, Socrates, the latter iseasier than theformer." "Itwouldn't bestrange, byZeus,"Isaid. "Imyself alsohadthe thought when youspoke that, inthe first place, each ofusisnaturally notquite likeanyone else, butrather differs inhisnature; different bmen areaptfortheaccomplishment ofdifiFerent jobs. Isn't thatyour opinion?" "Itis." 46 Book 11/369b-371a socrates/adeimantus "And, what about this?Whowould doafiner job,oneman prac- 370b ticingmany arts,oronemanoneart?" "One man,one art,"hesaid. "And, further, it'salsoplain, Isuppose, that ifaman letsthecru- cialmoment inanywork pass, itiscompletely ruined." "Yes, itisplain." "Idon't suppose thething done iswilling toawait theleisure of themanwhodoes it;but it'snecessary forthemanwhodoes itto follow closeupon thething done, andnotasaspare-time occupation." c "It isnecessary." "So,onthisbasis each thing becomes more plentiful, finer, and easier, when oneman,exempt from other tasks, doesonething accord- ingtonature and atthecrucial moment." "That's entirely certain." "Now, then, Adeimantus, there's need ofmore citizens than four fortheprovisions ofwhich wewere speaking. Forthefarmer, asit seems, won'tmake hisownplow himself, ifit'sgoing
