take up three whole months; [It is not quite clear what the Chinese word, here translated as "mantlets", described. Ts�ao Kung simply defines them as "large shields," but we get a better idea of them from Li Ch�uan, who says they were to protect the heads of those who were assaulting the city walls at close quarters. This seems to suggest a sort of Roman TESTUDO, ready made. Tu Mu says they were wheeled vehicles used in repelling attacks, but this is denied by Ch�en Hao. See supra II. 14. The name is also applied to turrets on city walls. Of the "movable shelters" we get a fairly clear description from several commentators. They were wooden missile-proof structures on four wheels, propelled from within, covered over with raw hides, and used in sieges to convey parties of men to and from the walls, for the purpose of filling up the encircling moat with earth. Tu Mu adds that they are now called "wooden donkeys."] and the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take three months more. [These were great mounds or ramparts of earth heaped up to the level of the enemy�s walls in order to discover the weak points in the defense, and also to destroy the fortified turrets mentioned in the preceding note.] 1. The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men to the assault like swarming ants, [This vivid simile of Ts�ao Kung is taken from the spectacle of an army of ants climbing a wall. The meaning is that the general, losing patience at the long delay, may make a premature attempt to storm the place before his engines of war are ready.] with the result that one-third of his men are slain, while the town still remains untaken. Such are the disastrous effects of a siege. CHAPTER 4. ATTACK BY STRATAGEM 39 [We are reminded of the terrible losses of the Japanese before Port Arthur, in the most recent siege which history has to record.] 1. Therefore the skillful leader subdues the enemy�s troops without any fight- ing; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field. [Chia Lin notes that he only overthrows the Government, but does no harm to individuals. The classical instance is Wu Wang, who after having put an end to the Yin dynasty was acclaimed "Father and mother of the people."] 1. With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire, and thus, without losing a man, his triumph will be complete. [Owing to the double meanings in the Chinese text, the latter part of the sentence is susceptible of quite a different meaning: "And thus, the weapon not being blunted by use, its keenness remains perfect."] This is the method of attacking by stratagem. 1. It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy�s one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him;
