Orhowshould itbe?" "Like that," hesaid. "Won't these places besuch astoprovide adequate shelter inboth winter andsummer?" "Yes, ofcourse," hesaid."Foryouseem tometomean houses." "Yes," Isaid, "those ofsoldiers, notmoneymakers." "How," hesaid, "doyoumean todistinguish theonefrom the 416a other?" "Ishall trytotellyou," Isaid. "Surely themost terrible and shameful thing ofallisforshepherds toreardogs asauxiliaries forthe flocks insuch away thatduetolicentiousness, hunger orsome other badhabit, theythemselves undertake todoharm tothesheep and in- stead ofdogsbecome likewolves." "Terrible," hesaid."Ofcourse." "Mustn't weineverywayguard against theauxiliaries doing any-ly thing likethattothecitizens, since they arestronger than they,becom- inglikesavage masters instead ofwell-meaning allies?" "Yes," hesaid,"wemust." "And wouldn't they have been provided with the greatest safeguard iftheyhayebeen really finely educated?" "But theyhave been," hesaid. And Isaid, "It'snot fittobetoosureabout that,mydearGlau- con.However, itisfittobesureabout whatwewere saying awhile ago, thattheymust gettheright education, whatever itis,ifthey're c going tohave what's most important forbeing tame with each other andthosewho areguarded bythem." "That's right," hesaid. "Now, some intelligent manwould saythat, inaddition tothis education, theymustbeprovided withhouses andother property such asnottoprevent them frombeing thebestpossible guardians andnot torouse themuptodoharm totheother citizens." d "And hellspeak thetruth." "Well, then," Isaid, "see ifthis isthewaytheymust liveandbe housed ifthey're going tobesuchmen. First, noonewillpossess any private property except forwhat's entirely necessary. Second, noone willhaveanyhouse orstoreroom intowhich everyone whowishes can- notcome.

Then theythemselves aswell astherestofthecityare already rushing toward adestruction that liesvery near.
