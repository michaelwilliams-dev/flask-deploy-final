OBSERVANCE OFTHE LAW Beginningin1905, rumors started tospread throughout Paris ofayoung Oriental girlwho danced inaprivate home, wrappedinveils that shegrad- ually discarded. Alocal journalist who had seen herdancing reportedthat “awoman from theFarEast had come toEuropeladen with perfume and jewels,tointroduce some oftherichness oftheOriental colour andiifeinto thesatiated society ofEuropean cities.” Sooneveryoneknew thedam:er’s name: Mata Han‘. Early thatyear,inthewinter, small and select audiences would gather in asalon filled with Indian statues and other relics while anorchestra playedmusic inspired byHindu andJavanese melodies. After keepingthe audience waitingandwondering, Mata Hari would suddenly appear,ina startling costume: awhite cotton brassiere covered with India.n~type jewels; jeweledbands atthewaist supportingasarong that revealed asmuch asit concealed; braceletsupthe arms. Then Mata Hari would dance, inastyle nooneinFrance had seen before, herwhole body swayingasifshe were in atrance. She told her excited and curious audience that her dances told stories from Indian mythologyandjavanese folktales. Soon the cream of Paris, and ambassadors from far—off lands, were competing forinvitations tothesalon, where itwas rumored that Mata. Hari wasactually performing sacred dances inthenude. Thepublicwanted toknow more about her. She toldjournaliststhat she wasactually Dutch inorigin,buthad grown upontheisland ofjava. Shewould also talkabout time spentinIndia, how shehad learned sacred Hindu dances there, and how Indian women “can shoot straight, ride horseback, and arecapableofdoing logarithmsand talkphilosophy.” By the summer of1905, although few Parisians hadactuallyseen Mata Hari dance, her name was oneveryone’s lips. AsMata Hari gavemore interviews, thestory ofherorigins kept changing:She had grown upinIndia, hergrandmotherwas thedaughter ofajavanese princess,shehad lived ontheisland ofSumatra where she had spent hertime “horsebaxzk riding, guninhand, andrisking herlife.” No one knew certain about her, butjournalistsdidnotmind these changesinherbiography. They compared her toanIndian goddess,a creature from thepages ofBaudelaire—whatever their imaginationwanted toseeinthismysteriouswoman from theEast. InAugust of1905, Mata Hari performedforthefirst time inpublic. Crowds throngingtoseeher onopening nightcaused ariot. She had now become acult figure, spawning many imitations. One reviewer wrote, “Mata Hari personifies allthepoetry ofIndia, itsmysticism,itsvoluptuous- ness, itshypnotizingcharm.” Another noted, “IfIndiapossessessuch unex- pected treasures, then allFrenchmen will emigratetothe shores ofthe Ganges.” Soon thefame ofMata Hari and her sacred Indian dances spreadbe- yondParis. She was invited toBerlin, Vienna, Milan. Over the next few yearssheperformed throughout Europe,mixed with thehighestsocial cir- cles, and earned anincome that gave her anindependence rarely enjoyed byawoman oftheperiod. Then, near theend ofWorld WarI,she was ar- rested inFrance, tried, convicted, andfinally executed asaGermanspy. Only during thetrial didthetruth come out: Mata Hari was notfromjava orIndia, had notgrown upintheOrient, did not have adropofEastern blood inherbody.Her real name wasMargaretha Zelle, and she came from thestolid northern province ofFriesland, Holland. Interpretation When Margaretha Zelle arrived inParis, in1904, she had half afranc in herpocket.She was one ofthethousands ofbeautifulyoung girls who flocked toParisevery year, taking work asartists’ models, nightclub dancers, orvaudeville performersattheFolies Bergére.After afewyears theywould inevitably bereplaced byyounger girls,and would often end uponthestreets, turningtoprostitution,orelsereturningtothetown they came from, older and chastened. Zelle hadhigher ambitions. She had nodance experience and had never performedinthetheater, but asayoung girlshehad traveled with herfamilyand had witnessed local dances inJava and Sumatra.
