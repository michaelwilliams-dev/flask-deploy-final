on the enemy, but does not allow the enemy�s will to be imposed on him. [One mark of a great soldier is that he fight on his own terms or fights not at all. 1 ] 1. By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach of his own accord; or, by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible for the enemy to draw near. [In the first case, he will entice him with a bait; in the second, he will strike at some important point which the enemy will have to defend.] 1. If the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him; 1See Col. Henderson�s biography of Stonewall Jackson, 1902 ed., vol. II, p. 490. 53 CHAPTER 7. WEAK POINTS AND STRONG 54 [This passage may be cited as evidence against Mei Yao- Ch�en�s inter- pretation of I. ss. 23.] if well supplied with food, he can starve him out; if quietly encamped, he can force him to move. 1. Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march swiftly to places where you are not expected. 2. An army may march great distances without distress, if it marches through country where the enemy is not. [Ts�ao Kung sums up very well: "Emerge from the void [q.d. like "a bolt from the blue"], strike at vulnerable points, shun places that are defended, attack in unexpected quarters."] 1. You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack places which are undefended. [Wang Hsi explains "undefended places" as "weak points; that is to say, where the general is lacking in capacity, or the soldiers in spirit; where the walls are not strong enough, or the precautions not strict enough; where relief comes too late, or provisions are too scanty, or the defenders are variance amongst themselves."] You can ensure the safety of your defense if you only hold positions that cannot be attacked. [I.e., where there are none of the weak points mentioned above. There is rather a nice point involved in the interpretation of this later clause. Tu Mu, Ch�en Hao, and Mei Yao-ch�en assume the meaning to be: "In order to make your defense quite safe, you must defend EVEN those places that are not likely to be attacked;" and Tu Mu adds: "How much more, then, those that will be attacked." Taken thus, however, the clause balances less well with the preceding�always a consideration in the highly antithetical style which is natural to the Chinese. Chang Yu, therefore, seems to come nearer the mark in saying: "He who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven [see IV. ss. 7], making it impossible for the enemy to guard against him. This being so, the places that I shall attack are precisely those that the enemy cannot defend. He who is skilled in defense hides in the most secret recesses of the earth, making it impossible for the enemy to estimate his whereabouts.
