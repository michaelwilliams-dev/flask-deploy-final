by those who were perceived as misers. The others faded away. Pope Julius II, exploiting a reputation for liberality to reach the papacy, didn't up to keep this pretence make war. The King of France waged many wars without special taxes by practicing steadfast parsi.mony. The current King of Spain had he been reputed liberal would not have won many of his undertakings. So a Prince has to bear the reputation of being stingy if he is 90� Niccol� Machiavelli to not rob his subjects, if he is to defend them, if he is not become poor, if he is not to become rapacious. It is a vice that helps him rule. If someone objects, that Ceasar practiced liberality to be.come emperor, and many others as Prince of the realm or to win a Princedom. In the former case, liberality is harmful; in the latter case, it is necessary. Ceasar needed to practice liberality to win the Principality of Rome, but once established, if he had not abated the spending, he would have ruined the Empire. If some.one alleges that many Princes who have done great things with the armies have been considered liberal, then I answer, the Prince either spends his own or his subject�s goods, he spends or the goods of others. In the former case he will have to be parsimoni.no ous, in the second situation he should skimp in way. A Prince who travels with the armies and lives off the prey, sacking and pillaging, lives off others and must practice liberality in every way. Otherwise, the soldiers will not follow him. It is best to liberally distribute the goods of others, as did Cyrus, Ceasar, and Alexander. Spending the wealth of others tarnishes no reputation but adds to it. Only spending your own resources hurts you. Nothing harms your own resources like liberality. As you spend, you deplete the resources for spending. You become either poor or impoverished, or, to escape poverty, rapacious and hateful. Of all things that a Prince needs to avoid are becoming withdrawn and hated. Liberality leads that. It wiser be to is to known as a miser, which gives you a bad but not a hated name, than to desire to bask in the name of liberality and be reduced to infamy as a rapacious and a hated ruler.

Cesare Borgia was deemed cruel. But his "cruelty" pacified Romagna, united it, and subjected it. Truly seen, this was more compassion than what the Florentines did. in The Florentines temporized and procrastinated in Pistoia the name of compassion, only to let the town be destroyed. A Prince should ignore charges of cruelty and make his priority the unity and faith of his subjects. Many times, is better
