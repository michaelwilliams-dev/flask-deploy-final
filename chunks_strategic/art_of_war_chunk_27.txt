a dialogue between T�ai Tsung and his great general Li Ching, it is usually ascribed to the latter. Com- petent authorities consider it a forgery, though the author was evidently well versed in the art of war. [7] LI CHING PING FA (not to be confounded with the foregoing) is a short treatise in 8 chapters, preserved in the T�ung Tien, but not published separately. This fact explains its omission from the SSU K�U CH�UAN SHU. [8] WU CH�I CHING, in 1 CHUAN. Attributed to the legendary minister Feng Hou, with exegetical notes by Kung-sun Hung of the Han dynasty (d. 121 B.C.), and said to have been eulogized by the celebrated general Ma Lung (d. 300 A.D.). Yet the earliest mention of it is in the SUNG CHIH. Although a forgery, the work is well put together. Considering the high popular estimation in which Chu-ko Liang has always been held, it is not surprising to find more than one work on war ascribed to his pen. Such are (1) the SHIH LIU TS�E (1 CHUAN), preserved in the YUNG LO TA TIEN; (2) CHIANG YUAN (1 CHUAN); and (3) HSIN SHU (1 CHUAN), which steals wholesale from Sun Tzu. None of these has the slightest claim to be considered genuine. Most of the large Chinese encyclopedias contain extensive sections devoted to the literature of war. The following references may be found useful: T�UNG TIEN (circa 800 A.D.), ch. 148-162. T�AI P�ING YU LAN (983), ch. 270-359. WEN HSIEN TUNG K�AO (13th cent.), ch. 221. YU HAI (13th cent.), ch. 140, 141. SAN TS�AI T�U HUI (16th cent). KUANG PO WU CHIH (1607), ch. 31, 32. CH�IEN CH�IO LEI SHU (1632), ch. 75. YUAN CHIEN LEI HAN (1710), ch. 206-229. KU CHIN T�U SHU CHI CH�ENG (1726), section XXX, esp. ch. 81- 90. HSU WEN HSIEN T�UNG K�AO (1784), ch. 121-134. HUANG CH�AO CHING SHIH WEN PIEN (1826), ch. 76, 77. The bibliographical sections of certain historical works also deserve mention: BIBLIOGRAPHY 28 CH�IEN HAN SHU, ch. 30. SUI SHU, ch. 32-35. CHIU T�ANG SHU, ch. 46, 47. HSIN T�ANG SHU, ch. 57,60. SUNG SHIH, ch. 202-209. T�UNG CHIH (circa 1150), ch. 68. To these of course must be added the great Catalogue of the Imperial Library: SSU K�U CH�UAN SHU TSUNG MU T�I YAO (1790), ch. 99, 100. The previously mentioned works are the oldest Chinese treatises on war, after Sun Tzu. The notes on each have been drawn principally from the SSU K�U CH�UAN SHU CHIEN MING MU LU, ch. 9, fol. 22 sqq. Chapter 2 LAYING PLANS [Ts�ao Kung, in defining the meaning of the Chinese for the title of this chapter, says it refers to the deliberations in the temple selected by the general for his temporary use, or as we should say, in his tent. See. ss. 26.] 1. Sun Tzu said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State. 2. It is a matter of life and death, a road either
