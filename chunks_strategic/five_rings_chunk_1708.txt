IRAN>3I.!\'l'l3D BY Cmusr<>PHF,R MAURER, 1996 LAW 11TRANSGRESSION OFTHE LAW When Louis XIV died, in1715, after aglorious fifty—five-year reign,alleyes focused onhisgreat-grandsonand chosen successor, thefuture Louis XV. Would theboy, onlyfive atthetime, proveasgreataleader asthe Sun King?Louis XIV had transforrned acountryontheverge ofcivil war into thepreeminent powerinEurope.The lastyears ofhisreignhad been difli~ cult—-he had been oldand l:ired——but itwashopedthat thechild would de- velopinto thekind ofstrong ruler who would reinvigorate theland and add tothefirm foundation that Louis XIV had laid. Tothisend thechild wasgiven thebest minds ofFrance ashistutors, men who would instruct him inLhe adsofstatecraft, inthemethods that theSunKinghadperfected. Nothingwasneglectedinhiseducation. But when Louis XV came tothethrone, in1726, asudden changecame over him: He nolongerhad tostudyorpleaseothers orprove himself. Hestood alone atthetopofagreat country, with wealth andpowerathiscommand. Hecould do ashewished. Inthefirstyearsofhisreign, Louis gavehimself over topleasure, leav- ingthegovernmentinthehands ofaousted minister, André-Hercule de Fleuiy.This caused little concern, forhewas a.youngman who needed to sow hiswild oats, and deFleurywas agood minister. Butitslowly became clear that {his was more than apassing phase. Louis had nointerest ingov- erning.His mainworrywas notFrance’s finances, orapossiblewar with Spain,butboredom. Hecould notstand being bored, andwhen hewas not hunting deer, orchasing young girls, hewhiledawayhistime atthegain- bling tables, losing hugesums inasingle night. The court, asusual, reflected the tastes oftheruler. Gambling and lav- ishparties became theobsession. The courtiers had noconcern with thefu- ture ofFrance-—they pouredtheir energies intocharmingtheking, angling fortitles that would bringthem lifepensions,and forcabinet positionsde- manding little work butpaying huge salaries. Parasites flocked tothecourt, and thestate’s debts swelled. In1745 Louis fellinlove with Madame dePompadour,awoman of middle~cla,ss originwho hadmanagedtorisethrough hercharms, herintel- ligence, and agood marriage.Madame dePompadour became theofiicial royal mistress; she also became France’s arbiter oftaste and fashion. But theMadame hadpolitical ambitions aswell, and sheeventually emerged asthecountxy’sunofficial piimeminister——it was she, notLouis, who wielded hiring~and-firing powerover France’s most importantministers. Ashegrew older Louis only needed more diversion. Onthegrounds ofVersailles hebuilt abrothel, Pare aux Cerfs, which housed some ofthe prettiest young girlsofFrance. Underground passagesand hidden stair- cases gave Louis access atallhours. After Madame dePompadour died, in 1764, she was succeeded asroyal mistress byMadame duBariy, who soon came todominate thecourt, and who, like dePompadour before her, begantomeddle inaffairs ofstate. Ifaminister didnotpleaseherhewould find himself fired. AllofEuropewasaghastwhen duBarry,thedaughterof abaker, managedtoarrange thefiring ofEtienne deChoiseul, theforeign minister and France’s most ablediplomat.Hehad shown her toolittle re- spect.Astime went by,swindlers and Charlatans made their nests inVer- sailles, and enticed Louis’s interest inastrology,theoccult, and fraudulent business deals. Theyoungandpampered teenager who had taken over France yearsbefore hadonly grownworse withage. The motto that became attached toLouis’s reignwas‘.'Apré.r moi, It de’lugz"——“Aftermetheflood,” or,Let France rotafter Iamgone.And in
