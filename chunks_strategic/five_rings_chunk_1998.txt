IntheApology, where he most forcefully states hissuperiority tothefearofdeath, Socrates iden- tifies himself with Achilles. Itisnotforafailure ofcourage thatSoc- rates isreproaching theheroes. What heobjects toistheprice such men, given theirunderstanding ofdeath, mustpay inorder toface it. With hisanalysis ofAchilles, Socrates isactually beginning acritique ofthecourage based onspiritedness which isthus alsoacritique ofthe warrior class ofhiscity.Thesurface presentation ofspiritedness and spirited men intheRepublic isthatthey areeasily educable andcan become thefoundation ofthegood city.This isanecessary presupposi- tionofthegood city.Butberieath that surface runs acurrent which [354 Interpretive Essay shows thatspiritedness isamost problematic element ofthesouland thecity,andthatthegood city ishence most improbable. Spiritedness firstappeared inthecityasthemeans toprotect its stolen acquisitions. And this isakeytothenature ofspiritedness: itis verymuch connected with thedefense ofone'sown.This isparticularly true inthecaseofAchilles whose anger isaroused byAgamemnon's taking away hisprize ofwar, themaid Briseis, andwhose rage isthe result ofthelossofhisfriend, Patroclus. Ifwetake Achilles asthe model ofthespirited man,weseethatanger isparticularly directed toward punishment ofthosewhotakeaway one'sown.Although anger causesmen tobewilling tosacrifice life, itissomehow connected with preserving those things which make lifepossible. Now, itisinthe nature ofhuman anger toseek forjustification. Itisdifficult foraman tobeangrywhen heisconvinced thatwhat istaken fromhimdoesnot belong tohimorthat hislosses orsufferings arehisown fault.Anger requires something orsomeone toblame; itattributes responsibility to what injures, and itisclosely allied with thesense ofjustice and in- justice. Unfortunately, itisunreasoning andcaneasily mistake itssense ofinjustice forthefactofinjustice. Itcansupport reason inlegitimate defense andpunishment, but itmay alsooppose reason, for itisun- willing toadmit anything that calls intoquestion therightness ofits cause. Anger maybeeducated tobecome averygenerous passion, arousing itself atthesight ofwhatever appears tobeinjustice; butno matter what thesubstance ofthecharges ofinjustice itmakes, nomat- terhow selfish theinterest itisreally protecting, itisalways accompa- niedbytheconviction that itisjust.Anger isalways self-righteous; itis attherootofmoral indignation, butmoral indignation isadangerous and,although necessary, often unreasonable andevenimmoral passion. Thetendency ofanger istogivethecolor ofreason andmorality to selfishness. Thishasbeen revealed bytheonlycharacter inthedialogue whohasexpressed anger; Thrasymachus' anger defends thecity'sown against philosophy when philosophy threatens the city's injustice. Spiritedness istheonlyelement inthecityormanwhich byitsvery nature ishostile tophilosophy. Inorder toovercome fearofdeath, spiritedness requires analmost fanatic fury; for,although thehero loves honor, headmits that itisbet- tertobeaslaveonearth than aking inHades. Forhim tobeheroic is literally unreasonable; hemustovercome hisreason inorder tobea hero.He isanenemy ofreason. The alternatives asheseesthem are either areasonable butignoble attachment tolifeoranoble butunrea- sonable willingness todie.Anger permits him toconquer thefearof terrible things; butinsodoing itexacts ahigh price, for itforces the [355 ] THEREPUBLIC man,whose existence isthreatened andwhose prospects aresobleak toattach toohigh avalue andcosmic significance tothesacrifice ofthat existence. Itcannot facethesenselessness oraccidental quality ofa particular death andviolently resists anything which would rob itofits meaning. Inother words, anger provides unreasonable reasons for heroic action. Itsees acts ofinjustice and duties ofpunishment everywhere. That iswhy Achilles treats lifeless bodies asthough they weremenandscourges them; that iswhy rivers that resisthimbecome godswhodefyhim.Thisdoeshave theeffect ofelevating hisheroism tofantastic heights andofmaking himcapable ofthemost extraor- dinary deeds, butonly atthecostofinvesting theworld withabsurd meaning, onlybybelieving in,andperhaps fabricating, demonic beings whominister toandjustify hisanger. Bychanging thisview ofdeath, Socrates hopes tocurb theextremes ofthewarriors' spiritedness without giving uptheadvantages itbrings. Thediscussion ofcourage, which canbeviewed asananalysis of thecharacter ofAchilles, isfollowed byadiscussion ofmoderation; andonce again Achilles assimies acentral role. Inthecurious account given bySocrates, moderation isnot,aswould beexpected, primarily control ofthebodily desires butobedience torulers. Though Socrates does notsaysoexplicitly, itisclear thatanger isthemain cause of disobedience torulers, and that Achilles istheverymodel ofthe disobedient subject. Hisanger, closely allied with hisself-respect, makes
