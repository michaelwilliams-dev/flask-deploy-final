your interest in The Prin.ce and sends his best wishes . WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON The Prince must be a very rewarding project to translate and quite a good deal of fun . Professor DAVID CALLEO, THE PRINCE by Niccol� Machiavelli DEDICATION TO LORENZO DE MEDICI 1492 -1519 DUKE OF URBINO, DESCENDED FROM THE MEDICIS OF FLORENCE � NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH LORENZO THE MAGNIFICENT, THE MERCHANT PRINCE, 1469-1492. sents wherefor s Princ presented may thems see a that him�uallydearthosetoseekingwelvfavorsorfromsomethinga Prince givewithimdelightpre- U horses, weapons, gold banners, jewels, and other treasures. Myself, desir.ing to offer your Magnificence some token of my service, I only find among my most favored and esteemed things offer my to own knowledge of the actions of great men drawn from long ex.perience of modernity and antiquity. Having long considered and examined these things, I now present them to your Magnificence in this small volume. Although I hold this work unworthy of your Magnificence, I trust that, for its humanity, it should be accepted, considering that I can make no greater gift than the sharing of faculty the of quickly understanding all that I, through many years of discom.forts and dangers, learned and understand.

Principalities are either hereditary, transmitted by family blood, or they are new. New Principalities are either cut from new cloth completely, as was the Principality of Milan for Fran.cesco Sforza , or they are new parts added to the holdings of the Prince that acquires them � as was the
