Observance lll In1514 thetwenty—two-year-oldPietro Aretino wasworkingasalowlyas- sistant scullion toawealthyRoman family. Hehad ambitions ofgreatness asawriter, toenflame theworld with hisname, buthow could amere lackey hopetorealize such dreams? Thatyear PopeLeoXreceived from thekingofPortugalanembassy that included many gifts,most prominent among them agreat elephant, thefirstinRome since imperialtimes. Theponhff adored thiselephant and showered itwith attention andgifts.Butdespitehislove and care, theele pliant,which was called Hanna, became deathlyill.Thepope summoned doctors, who administered afive—hundred-pound purgativetothe ele pliant,butalltonoavail. The animal died and thepopewent into mourn- ing.Toconsole himself hesummoned thegreat painter Raphaeland ordered him tocreate alife-sized painting ofHanno above theanimals tomb, bearingtheinscription, “What nature tookaway, Raphaelhaswith hisartrestored.” Over thenext fewdays,apamphletcirculated throughout Rome that caused great niernment andlaughter. Entitled “The Last Will and Testa- ment oftheElephant Hanna,” itread, inpart,“Tomyheir theCardinal Santa Croce, Igive myknees, sothat hecan imitatemygenuilections.... Tomyheir Cardinal Santi Quattro, Igive myjaws,sothat hecan more readilydevour allofChrist’s revenues. .. .Tomyheir Cardinal Medici, I give my ears, sothat he can hear everyone’s doings.. ..”ToCardinal Grassi, who had areputation forlechery,theelephant bequeathed theap propriate,oversized part ofhisown anatomy. Onand ontheanonymous pamphlet went, sparingnone ofthegreat inRome, not even thepope. With each one ittook aim attheir best—known weakness. Thepamphletended with verse, “See toitthat Aretino isyour friend /Forheisabadenemytohave. IHiswords alone could ruin the high pope /SoGod guard everyone from histongue.” Interpretation With one short pamphlet, Aretino, sonofapoorshoemaker and aservant himself, hurled himself tofame. EveryoneinRome rushed tofind outwho thisdaring youngman was. Even thepope,amused byhisaudacity, sought him outand ended upgiving him ajobinthepapalservice. Over theyears he came tobeknown asthe“Scourge ofPrinces,” and hisbiting tongue earned him therespectand fearofthegreat,from theking ofFrance tothe Hapsburg emperor. The Aretino strategyissimple:When youare assmall and obscure as David was, youmust find aGoliath toattack. The largerthetarget,the more attentionyou gain.The bolder theattack, the moreyoustand out from thecrowd, and the more admirationyoueam. Societyisfullofthose who think daring thoughts butlack thegutstoprintandpublicize them. Voice what thepublic feels--the expression ofshared feelingsisalways powerful. Search outthe most prominent target possibleandsling your boldest shot. The world willenjoythespectacle, and willhonor theunder- dog—you,that is-—with gloryandpower. KEYS TO POWER Most ofusaretimid.
