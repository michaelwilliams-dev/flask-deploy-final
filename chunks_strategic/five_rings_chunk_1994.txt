succeeded inmaking such acombination ofopposites, andGlaucon need onlyrecognize him forwhatheisto solve hisdilemma concerning thebestwayoflife.Socrates, according tohisownaccount, isanerotic man,buthiserosdoesnotleadhim, as itdidCephalus, toinjure others ortakewhat belongs tothem. Inorder tosatisfy hiseras,heneed notcompete with othermen totheir detri- ment.Hehasnowealth andnohonor; infacthe isdespised and believed tobeunjust. Yetheishappy. Finally heisexecuted forhis very justice, butthiswillnotcause himtoregret hischoice ofwayof life.He fulfills theharsh conditions Glaucon setforthejustman, but also lives ingreat pleasure. Hedoes notlivewithout theordinary pleasures because heisanascetic, butbecause theintensity ofhisjoyin philosophy makes him indifferent tothem. Once Glaucon canseethe possibility ofsuch awayoflifehewillbectued ofhisdesire fortyran- ny;already hehassomehow divined thepresence ofsuch awayoflife inSocrates. Tobesure,heisnotyetconscious ofthenature ofhisown desires, orofdesire ingeneral, butintherevolt against thesimple city heandSocrates arereally allies. Glaucon findsnosatisfaction init;and there couldbenoSocrates living there, bothbecause itisnotadvanced enough togivehimthebasis foraphilosophic understanding andbe- cause suchanidle,unproductive manwould starve todeath. Perhaps theobjections ofthetwomen areultimately thesame: thesolution to thepolitical problem embodied inthiscity isnotahuman one.Ahu- man solution requires theemancipation ofdesire, foronlythencanvir- tue arise. Humanity requires aself-overcoming; notbecause life is [347 ] THEREPUBLIC essentially struggle, butbecause man's dual nature issuch that the goods ofthesoulcannot bebrought tolightwithout thebody's being tempted and, therefore, without atyranny ofsouloverbody. (372e-376c) Socrates agrees tojoinGlaucon inobserving a feverish city, asopposed tothehealthy onetheyhadjustbeen observ- ing.Onewould think thattheywould dothisonly asastudy inpa- thology, keeping thehealthy model constantly before their eyes. Ac- tually, thehealthy city isforgotten andthegood city isconstituted bya reform ofthefeverish cityrather thanbyareturn tothehealthy one. Noserious attempt isevenmade tolook forjustice inthehealthy city. Thenew cityfounded byGlaucon's desire begins with anactofin- justice. Since luxury creates scarcity, landmustbetaken from others. Noteveryone canhave acitywhich issufficient tosupport alifeof satisfaction. Hence, thecityproper isformed, that is,theband of brothers whohave enemies, whomustmake warandbewarriors. It would appear from thispresentation thatwar isrequisite tothe emergence ofhumanity; asthecityofsowswasgentle andreflected a fundamental harmony among men, sothecityofwarriors isharsh and reflects afundamental conflict among men. Paradoxically this isthe firsthuman city. Itcannot claim that itdoes notharm othermen; its justification canonlybeinthequality oflife itprovides foritscitizens. Here there emerges anew class ofmendevoted totheartofwar, andintheir soulsemerges anew principle, spiritedness. Thewamors mustbemenwho liketofight,who arecapable ofanger,whorush to thedefense oftheir cityandofjustice. Spiritedness isadifficult motive tounderstand, and itscharacter canonlybeseenbycontrasting itwith desire. Desires aredirected tothesatisfaction ofaneed: they express anincompleteness andyearn forcompleteness. Hunger, thirst, sexual desire, etc., areallimmediately related toagoalandtheirmeaning is simple. Thegoalofspiritedness ismuch harder todiscern. Itssimplest manifestation isanger, and itisnotimmediately manifest what needs arefulfilled byanger. Spiritedness seems characterized morebythefact that itovercomes desire thanbyanypositive goalofitsown.Moreover, thedesires related tothebody— which aretheonlyones thathave ap- peared thusfar— allhave aself-preservative function, whereas spir- itedness, onthecontrary, ischaracterized byanindifference tolife. Itmayindeed aidinthepreservation oflife,but itcanjustaswellplace honor above life.The citymay exist forthesake oflife,but itneeds menwho arewilling todiefor it. At first sight, thewarriors look likethepractitioners ofjust another art,tobesetalongside theartsofshoemaking andfarming, but they arereally the firstruling classandintroduce the firstprinciple of [348 ] Interpretive Essay hierarchy intothecity. Similarly, spiritedness atfirstsightseems tobe justanother quality ofsoul, likethequalities whichmade amanafarm- erorablacksmith, but itreally represents anewpartofthesoul,one which willrulethedesires andestablish aprinciple ofhierarchy inthe soul.Thevarious artspresent inthe first city,however diverse inskill orproduct, allserve bodily satisfaction andarepracticed formoney. Ultimately they arethesame; their practitioners are allincluded together inwhat willbecalled thewage-earning class; although there aremany differences among itsmembers inactivity andintelligence, from thedecisive point ofview they arethesame— mere life istheir goal.They donotrepresent anyfundamental diversity ofprinciple. The warriors' art,however,
