allies. Those who talk a lot but not always to the point, who are slight in ability, with little that is extraordinary, are people with ordinary capabilities. They can be brought along as the lower class of allies. Responsiveness When you plan for difficulty in times of ease, when you do the great while it is still small, when you use rewards first and penalties later, this is refinement in use of the military. When the troops are already on the battlefield, the cavalries are charging each other, the catapults have been set in position, and the infantries meet at close range, if you can use awesome authoritativeness to convey a sense of trust such that opponents surrender, this is ability in use of the military. If you plunge into a hail of arrows and rocks, facing off in a contest for victory, with winning and losing distinct, if your adversary is wounded but you die, this is inferiority in use of the military. Taking Opportunities The art of certain victory, the mode of harmonizing with changes, is a matter of opportunity. Who but the perspicacious can deal with it? And of all avenues of seeing opportunity, none is greater than the unexpected. Assessing Abilities Those who employed warriors skillfully in ancient times assessed their abilities in order to calculate the prospects of victory or defeat: Who has the wiser ruler? Who has the more intelligent generals? Who has the more able officers? Whose food supplies are most abundant? Whose soldiers are better trained? Whose legions are more orderly? Whose war-horses are swifter? Whose formations and situation are more dangerous? Whose clients and allies are smarter? Whose neighbors are more frightened? Who has more goods and money? Whose citizenry is calmer? When you consider matters along these lines, structural strengths and weaknesses can be determined.

Therefore when their weapons are sharp and their armor is strong, people will readily do battle. If armor is not strong, it is the same as baring oneï¿½s shoulders. If a bow cannot shoot far, it is the same as a close-range weapon. If a shot cannot hit the mark, it is the same as having no weapon. If a scout is not careful, it is the same as having no eyes. If a general is not brave in battle, it is the same as having no military leadership. Striking Power Skilled warriors of ancient times first found out the condition of their enemies, and then made plans to deal with them. There is no doubt of success when you strike enemies under the following conditions: Their fighting forces are stale. Their supplies are exhausted. Their populace is full of sorrow and bitterness. Many people are physically ill. They do not plan ahead. Their equipment is in disrepair. Their soldiers are not trained. Reinforcements do not show up. Night falls when they still
