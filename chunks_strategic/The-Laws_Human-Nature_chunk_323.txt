after assuming the leadership position, King was arrested while driving, ostensibly for speeding, and placed in a cell full of the most hardened criminals. Once bail was posted, a trial was set for two days later, and who could guess what trumped up charges they might come up with? The night before his trial he received yet another phone call: �Nigger, we are tired of you and your mess now. And if you aren�t out of this town in three days we�re going to blow your brains out, and blow up your house.� Something in the tone of the caller�s voice sent chills down his spine�this seemed more than just a threat. He tried to sleep that night but couldn�t, the man�s voice on the phone call replaying in his mind. He went into the kitchen to make some coffee and calm himself down. He was shaking.

Stand up for justice. Stand up for truth. And lo, I will be with you, even until the end of the world.� The voice�that of the Lord, he felt sure�promised to never leave him, to come back to him when he needed it. Almost immediately he felt a sense of tremendous relief, the burden of his doubts and anxiety lifted from his shoulders. He could not help but cry. Several nights later, while King was attending an MIA meeting, his house was bombed. By sheer luck, his wife and daughter were unharmed. When informed of what had happened, he remained calm. He felt that nothing could rattle him now. Addressing an
