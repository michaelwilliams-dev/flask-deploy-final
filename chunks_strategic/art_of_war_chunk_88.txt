whether you are defending or attacking, from the proper utilization of natural features." 2 ] 34. Thus the skillful general conducts his army just as though he were leading a single man, willy-nilly, by the hand. [Tu Mu says: "The simile has reference to the ease with which he does it."] 35. It is the business of a general to be quiet and thus ensure secrecy; upright and just, and thus maintain order. 36. He must be able to mystify his officers and men by false reports and ap- pearances, [Literally, "to deceive their eyes and ears."] and thus keep them in total ignorance. [Ts�ao Kung gives us one of his excellent apophthegms: "The troops must not be allowed to share your schemes in the beginning; they may only rejoice with you over their happy outcome." "To mystify, mislead, and surprise the enemy," is one of the first principles in war, as had been fre- quently pointed out. But how about the other process�the mystification of one�s own men? Those who may think that Sun Tzu is over-emphatic on this point would do well to read Col. Henderson�s remarks on Stone- wall Jackson�s Valley campaign: "The infinite pains," he says, "with which Jackson sought to conceal, even from his most trusted staff officers, his movements, his intentions, and his thoughts, a commander less thorough would have pronounced useless"�etc. etc. 3 In the year 88 A.D., as we read in ch. 47 of the HOU HAN SHU, "Pan Ch�ao took the field 2"The Science of War," p. 333. 3"Stonewall Jackson," vol.

Pan Ch�ao summoned his officers and also the King of Khotan to a council of war, and said: �Our forces are now outnumbered and unable to make head against the enemy. The best plan, then, is for us to separate and disperse, each in a different direction. The King of Khotan will march away by the easterly route, and I will then return myself towards the west. Let us wait until the evening drum has sounded and then start.� Pan Ch�ao now secretly released the prisoners whom he had taken alive, and the King of Kutcha was thus informed of his plans. Much elated by the news, the latter set off at once at the head of 10,000 horsemen to bar Pan Ch�ao�s retreat in the west, while the King of Wen-su rode eastward with 8000 horse in or- der to intercept the King of Khotan. As soon as Pan Ch�ao knew that the two chieftains had gone, he called his divisions together, got them well in hand, and at cock-crow hurled them against the army of Yarkand, as it lay encamped.
