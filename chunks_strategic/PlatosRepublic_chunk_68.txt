model and which make all those who hear them shiver, as is thought.8 Perhaps they're good for something else, but we fear that our guardians, as a result of such shivers, will get hotter and softer than they ought." "And," he said, "our fear is right." "Then they must be deleted?" "Yes.ï¿½ Book III I 386c-388b SOCRATES/ADEIMANTUS "Must the model opposite to these be used in speaking and writ? ing?'' "Plainly." "Will we then take out the laments and wailings of famous men, too?" "If," he said, "what went before was necessary, so is this." "Now, consider whether we'll be right in taking them out or not," I said. "We surely say that a decent9 man will believe that for the de? cent man-who happens to be his comrade-being dead is not a terri? ble thing." "Yes, we do say that." "Then, he wouldn't lament him as though he had suffered some? thing terrible." "Surely not." "Moreover, we also say that such a man is most of all sufficient unto himself for living well and, in contrast to others, has least need of another." "True," he said. "Then for him it is least terrible to be deprived of a son, or a brother, or money, or of anything else of the sort." "Yes, least of all." "Then he laments the least and bears it most gently when some such misfortune overtakes him." "Quite so." "So, we'd be right in taking out the wailings of renowned men and we'd give them to women-and not to the serious ones, at that-and to all the bad men.

"Then, again, we'll ask Homer and the other poets not to make Achilles, son of a goddess, Now lying on his side, now again On his belly, and now on his side, Then standing upright, roaming distraught along the shore of the unharvested sea10 nor taking black ashes in both hands and pouring them over his head,11 nor crying and lamenting as much as, or in the ways, Homer made him do; nor Priam, a near offspring of the gods, entreating and Rolling around in dung, Calling out to each man by name.12 386. C d e 386. a b 388b C And yet far more than this, we'll ask them under no condition to make gods who lament and say, Ah me, wretched me, ah me, unhappy mother of the best man.13 But, if they do make gods so, at least they shouldn't dare to make so unlikely an imitation of the greatest of the gods as when he says, Ah woe, dear is the man I see with my own eyes being Chased around the town, and my heart is grieved14 and, d Oh, oh, Sarpedon, dearest of men to me, is fated To be vanquished by Patroclus, Menoetius'
