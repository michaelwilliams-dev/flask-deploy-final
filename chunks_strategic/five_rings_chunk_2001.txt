tomake what isnottruly highest appear tobehighest. Ultimately thePlatonic dialogue with itshero, Socrates, isthatform. Atthislevel ofthediscus- sion,however, Socrates leaves itatbanishing most poetsand insisting onasimple poetry which uses little imitation and,when itdoes use imitation, imitates onlygbodmen intheirgoodmoments. Hedoes so because hewishes toprotect thewarriors' hard-won moderation. Heal- sodoes sobecause hedoesnotwantthem tobelieve thattheheroes of poetry arethebestmen, forthey aretoberuledbymenvery different from those heroes andmust respect them. Just asSocrates deprived Adeimantus ofthegreater part ofthe charm derived from imitation, sohedeprives Glaucon ofmuch ofthe charm ofthepowerful accompaniments ofpoetry, harmony and rhythm, towhich he isparticularly inclined and atthemention of which herejoins thedialogue. Harmony andrhythm move thepassions inthemost primitive way, speechlessly appealing toirrational fears andpleasuresâ€” which arethemselves speechless. They possess aman andgivehimadeep sense ofthesignificance ofhissentiments. Socrates ruthlessly subjects harmony andrhythm tothetaleshewants told.Only those rhythms andharmonies which evoke thefeelings appropriate to thenewheroes areacceptable. Instead ofletting words follow music, a temptation apparently involved inthenature ofmusic's appeal, speech, logos, guides themusic completely. Thus Socrates hasmade himself the master ofpoetry; hecontrols what itrepresents, how itrepresents, and theaccompaniments which intensify itsappeal. Thismastery hasbeen gained, though, only atthecostofwhat lovers ofpoetry find attractive init. However, withGlaucon, asopposed tohisbrother, itisnotonly sacrifice that isdemanded. Adeimantus' disposition issuch astoaccept severe austerity when hesees itsnecessity forthepreservation ofthe cityheisintheprocess offounding orthefurtherance ofthatcom- fortable justice heasked forinhisspeech andwascontented with inthe cityofsows.ButGlaucon, ontheother hand, insists onwhat isgood for himself, andthecommunity isonlyofsecondary interest insofar asit [360 ] Interpretive Essay serves that goal. He, therefore, must have sufficient reasons forhis sacrifices; andtohimSocrates reveals thepositive purpose ofthewar- riors' education. Thewarriors aretobelovers ofthebeautiful, par- ticularly ofbeautiful souls.Theproducts ofthefineartsaretobeused tosurround them with imitations ofthebeautiful things; those imita- tions willgivethewarriors thehabit ofseeing beauty inthedeeds, characters, andspeeches ofvirtuous menandhence teachthem tolove thevirtue whose various aspects they seerepresented. Imitation must notflatter thepassions, buttransform andsublimate them.Thesevere moderation ofthebodily desires which Socrates hasimposed isthe condition oftheliberation oftheloveofthefairandthevirtuous. The needs ofthebody, ifdominant, lead tougliness, nomatter how itis adorned; fortheir satisfaction requires discord andvice.Thewarriors, prepared byrestraint oftheir desires andhabituated tothevision ofno- blemen, willshunThrasymachus' thieves andtyrants, notasaresult of moral principle butasamatter oftaste.Thewarriors willbemore politically reliable because theeros ofthebeautiful, agrace and delicacy ofsentiment andaction, willtemper their pursuit oftheir self- interest. Glaucon now seesthat eros, properly educated, hasaplace in theneworderandthusaccepts theefforts requisite tothatnew order. Inattempting tograsp what Socrates istrying toachieve here, itis again most helpful toturn toShakespeare's poetry. ThewiseProspero, whomust ruleunwise men inhislittle island cityoftheTempest, uses three kinds ofmotivations toinsure their political good conduct. The slavish Caliban canbemotivated onlybypinches andblows. Thecov- etous Alfonso and hiscohorts are, likeCephalus, restrained bythe equivalents ofconscience andthefear ofdivine punishment. But Prospero's favorites, towhom heintends tohand over hisrule, are lovers ofthebeautiful whoneednoharsher constraints. Ferdinand and Miranda areeach struck withwonder attheaspect oftheother's beauty. Each longs tobeworthy oftheother and iseager toperform thedeeds which willwinapproval. This isagentler, surer, andmore human path tovirtue. (403c-A12h) After music, which would seem tobethetraining of thewarriors' souls, Socrates turns togymnastic which would seem tobe thetraining ofthewarriors' bodies. Onemight haveexpected that this would bethemost important partoftheeducation since thesemen are being trained forcombat; theyareartisans ofvictory inbattle andthey must learn their artatleast aswell asanyoftheother artisans. However, Socrates treats thesubject asthough themen didnothave bodies andasthough theuseofarmswasnotthecause ofvictory.
