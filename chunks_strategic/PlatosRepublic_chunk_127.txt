that we are escaping one wave, 16 as it were, in telling about the woman's law, 17 so that we aren't entirely swept away when we lay it down that our guardians, men and women, must share all pursuits in common; rather, in a way the argument is in agreement with itself that it says what is both possible and benefi? cial?" "And indeed," he said, "it's not a little wave you're escaping." "You'll say that it's not a big one either," I said, "when you see the next one." "Tell me, and let me see it," he said. "The law that follows this one," I said, "and the others that went before is, as I suppose, this." "What?" "All these women are to belong to all these men in common, and no woman is to live privately with any man. And the children, in their tum, will be in common, and neither will a parent know his own off- spring, nor a child his parent." . "This one is far bigger than the other," he said, "so far as con? cerns doubt both as to its possibility and its beneficialness." "As to whether it is beneficial, at least, I don't suppose it would be disputed that the community of women and the community of children are, if possible, the greatest good," I said. "But I suppose that there would arise a great deal of dispute as to whether they are possible or not." "There could," he said, "very well be dispute about both." "You mean that there is a conspiracy of arguments against me," I -said. "I thought I would run away from the other argument, if in your opinion it were beneficial; then I would have the one about whether it's possible or not left." "But you didn't run away unnoticed," he said, "so present an argument for both." "I must submit to the penalty," I said. "Do me this favor, however. Let me take a holiday like the idle men who are accustomed to feast their minds for themselves when they walk along. And such men, you know, before finding out in what way something they desire can exist, put that question aside so they won't grow weary deliberating about what's possible and not. They set down as given the existence of what they want and at once go on to arrange the rest and enjoy giving a . full account of the sort of things they'll do when it has come into being, making yet idler a soul that is already idle. I too am by now soft myself, and I desire to put off and consider later in what way it is possible; and now, having set it down as possible, I'll consider, if you permit me, how the rulers will arrange these things when they come into being and � whether their accomplishment would be most advantageous of all for ��both the city and the guardians. I'll attempt to consider this with you first,
