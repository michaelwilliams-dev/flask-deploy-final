"Isthere then avirtue ofeyes, too?" "Avirtue, too." "And what about ears? Wasn't itagreed thattheyhavesome work?" "Yes." "And dotheyhave avirtue, too?" "Yes, they do." "Andwhat about allother things? Aren't theythesame?" They are. "Stop foramoment. Could eyeseverdoafinejoboftheirwork if [32 ] Book I/352d-354a socrates/thrasymachus they didnothave their proper virtue but, instead ofthe virtue, 353c vice?" "How could they?" hesaid."Foryouprobably mean blindness instead ofsight." "Whatever their virtuemay be," Isaid."For I'mnotyetasking that,butM'hether their work, thethings tobedonebythem, willbe done wellwith their proper virtue, andbadly with vice." "What yousay istrue," hesaid. "Will ears, too,dotheirwork badly when deprived oftheir vir- tue?" "Certainly." d "Then, shallweinclude everything elseinthesame argument?" "Inmyopinion, atleast." "Come, let'sconsider thisnow: istheresomework ofasoul that youcouldn't everaccomplish withanyother thing that is?Forexam- ple,managing, ruling, anddeliberating, and allsuch things—couldwe justly attribute them toanything other than asoulandassert thatthey arepeculiar toit?" "Tonothing else." "And, further, what about living? Shallwenotsaythat itisthe work ofasoul?" "Most ofall,"hesaid. "Then, dowesaythatthere isalsosome virtue ofasoul?" "We do." "Then, Thrasymachus, willasouleveraccomplish itswork well if e deprived ofitsvirtue, oristhatimpossible?" "Impossible." "Then abad soul necessarily rulesandmanages badly while a goodonedoes allthese things well." "Necessarily." "Didn't weagree that justice isvirtue ofsoul,and injustice, vice?" "We didsoagree." "Then thejustsoulandthejustman willhave agood life,andthe unjustman abadone." "Itlooks like it,"hesaid,"according toyourargument." "And themanwho lives well isblessed andhappy, andtheman 354a whodoesnot istheopposite." "Ofcourse." "Then thejustman ishappy andtheunjustmanwretched." "Let itbeso,"hesaid. [33 ] socrates/thbasymachus therepublic 354a "But itisnotprofitable tobewretched; rather itisprofitable tobe happy." "Ofcourse" "Then, myblessed Thrasymachus, injustice isnever more profitable than justice." "Let that," hesaid,"bethe fillofyourbanquet atthefestival of Bendis,45 Socrates." "Iowe ittoyou,Thrasymachus," Isaid, "since youhavegrown gentle andhave leftoffbeing hardonme.However, Ihave nothada h finebanquet, but it'smyown fault, notyours.

Tellme, isthere inyour opinion akind ofgood thatwewould choose tohave notbecause wedesire itsconsequences, butbecause wedelight initfor itsown sake—such asenjoyment and allthepleasures which are harmless and leave noafter effects Other than theenjoyment in having them?"
