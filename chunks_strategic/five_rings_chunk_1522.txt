Soon no one could take Peale’s show seriously,and attendance wentwaydown. Within afewweeks, theshow closed. Over thenext fewyearsBamum established areputationforaudac- ityand consummate showtnanship that lasted hiswhole life. Pea1e’s reputa- tion, ontheother hand, never recovered. Interpretation Bamum used two different tactics toruin Peale’s reputation.The first was simple:He sowed doubts about the museum’s stabilityand solvency. Doubt isapowerful weapon:Onceyouletitoutofthebag with insidious rumors, your opponentsareinahorrible dilemma. Onthe one hand they candenythe rumors, even provethatyouhave slandered them. But a layerofsuspicion will remain: Whyarethey defending themselves sodes- perately? Maybethe rumor has some truth toit?If,ontheother hand, they take thehigh road and ignore you,thedoubts, unrefuted, will be even stronger. Ifdone correctly, thesowing ofrumors can soinfuriate and unset- tleyourrivals that indefending themselves theywill make numerous mis- takes. This istheperfect weaponforthose who have noreputationoftheir own towork from. Once Bamum didhave areputationofhisown, heused thesecond, gentler tactic, thefake hypnotismdemonstration: Heridiculed hisrivals’ reputation.This too wasextremelysuccessful. Once you have asolid base ofrespect, ridiculing your opponentboth putshim onthedefensive and draws more attention toyou, enhancing yourown reputation. Outright slander and insult aretoostrongatthispoint; theyareugly, and may hurt youmore than help you.Butgentlebarbs andmockery suggest thatyou have astrong enoughsense ofyourown worth toenjoyagood laughat yourrival’sexpense. Ahumorous front canmake youout asaharmless en- tertainer while pokingholes inthereputationofyourrival. Itiseasier tocopewith abad conscience than with abadreputation.
