forthebeing dfrom itsimitation. Orhaven't youobserved that imitations, ifthey are practiced continually from youth onwards, become establishedas habits andnature, inbodyandsounds and inthought?" "Quite so,"hesaid. "Sothen," Isaid,"wewon't allow thosewhom weclaimwecare forandwhomust themselves become goodmen toimitate wom- en—since they aremen—either ayoung woman oranolder one, or onewho's abusing herhusband, oronewho's striving withgods and eboasting because shesupposes herself tobehappy, oronewho's caught inthegripofmisfortune, mourning andwailing. And we'llbefarfrom needing onewho's sickorinloveorinlabor." "That's entirely certain,"hesaid. "Normust they inanyevent imitate slaves, women ormen,who aredoing theslavish things." "No, they mustn't." "Nor, asitseems, badmenwho arecowards anddoing theop- posite ofwhatwejustnow said, insulting andmaking funofone another, andusing shameful language, drunk orsober, orcommitting 396a theother faults thatsuchmencommit against themselves andothers in speeches anddeeds. NordoIsuppose theyshould beaccustomed to likening themselves tomadmen inspeeches orindeeds. For, although theymustknow bothmadandworthless menandwomen, theymust neither donorimitate anything oftheirs." "Very true," hesaid. "And what about this," Isaid. "Should they imitate smiths at work, ormen exercising anyother craft, ormenrowing triremes or b calling time tothosewho do,oranything thathas todowith these things?" "How could thatbe,"hesaid, "since theywon't evenbepermitted topayattention toanyofthese things?" "And what about this?Horses neighing, bulls lowing, theroaring ofrivers, thecrashing ofthe sea, thunder, andeverything ofthe sort—willthey imitate them?" "But,"hesaid, "they're forbidden tobemad ortoliken them- selves tothemad." "Then, ifIunderstand whatyoumean,"Isaid, "there isacertain form ofstyle and narrative inwhich therealgentleman^^ narrates cwhenever hemust saysomething, and, again, another form, unlike this [74 ] Book III 1395c-397c socrates/adeimani one, inthemanwho isbynature andrearing theopposite ofthis 39i other, always keeps andinwhich henarrates." "Which arethey?" hesaid. "Inmyopinion," Isaid,"when thesensible mancomes inhisnar- rative tosome speech ordeed ofagoodman, hewillbewilling to report itasthough hehimself were thatmanandwon't beashamed of suchanimitation. Hewillimitate thegoodmanmostwhen heisacting steadily andprudently; less,andlesswillingly, when he'sunsteadied by diseases, loves,^^ drink, orsome other misfortune. Butwhen hemeets withsomeone unworthy ofhimself, hewon't bewilling seriously torep- resent himself asaninferior, unless, ofcourse, it'sbrief, when the mandoessomething good; rather, he'llbeashamed, bothbecause he's unpracticed atimitating suchmenandbecause hecan't stand forming himself according to,and fitting himself into, themodels ofworse men. Inhismindhedespises this,unless it'sdone inplay." "It's likely," hesaid. "Then, won't heuseanarration liketheonewedescribed alittle while agoconcerning Homer's verses, andwon't hisstyle participate in both imitation andtheother kind ofnarrative, butthere'll bealittle bit ofimitation inagreat dealofspeech? Oram Italking nonsense?" "That, "hesaid, "isjustthewaythemodel ofsuch aspeaker must be." "Now, then," Isaid, "asforthemanwho's notofthis sort, the morecommon he is,themore he'll narrate everything andthink noth- 397 ingunworthy ofhimself; hence he'llundertake seriously toimitate in thepresence ofmany everything wewere justmentioning—thunder, thenoises ofviinds, hailstorms, axles and pulleys, thevoices of trumpets, flutes, and alltheinstruments, andeven thesound ofdogs, sheep, andbirds. And thisman's whole style willbebased onimitation ofvoice andlooks, orelseinclude onlyabitofnarrative." "That," hesaid, "isalsotheway itmust be." "Well, then," Isaid, "these arethetwoforms ofstyle Imeant." "Sothey are,"hesaid. "Then, ofthetwo, one involves only small changes, and, if someone assigns theappropriate harmonic mode andrhythm^^ tothe style, itturns outthatthemanwhospeaks correctly speaks mostly in thesame styleandinonemode, forthechanges aresmall, andlikewise inasimilar rhythm." "That's exactly theway itis, "hesaid. "And what about theform oftheother? Doesn't itneed theop- posites—allmodes and allrhythms—ifit'sgoing tobespoken inits ownway,because itinvolves allspecies ofchanges?" "Yes, indeed, that's verymuch theway itis." [75] dcrates/adeimantus therepublic 397c "Do allthepoets andthemenwho sayanything fallintooneof these patterns ofstyle ortheother, ormake some mixture ofthem both?" "Necessarily," hesaid. d "What willwedothen?" Isaid.
