his own confidants. Pandolfo Petrucci, Prince of Siena (1500-1512), ruled more with help of suspect personages than with men of faith. But one cannot say too much because the matter varies with the sub.ject. Only note this that men, who are enemies at the outset of tenure, if they have quality, make a Prince strong if they can be won over. They become the more loyal the more they need to blot out the sinister reputation they had before. The Prince gets more use out of them than out of loyal servants who neglect things. to While investigating this matter, I don't want overlook THE PRINCE � 111 Princes who having taken over a state with the help of some of the citizens should keep in mind their interest and favor it. If the tie with them is not natural and only arose because they were dis.content, it will be hard to keep them as friends, because it will be hard to satisfy their needs. To tell the truth, ancient and modern examples show that it is much easier to pacify a population that was content before your takeover even though this made them your enemies than it is to content those who favored you and your purposes because they were discontent beforehand. Princes, to consolidate their power, are accustomed to build.ing fortresses. These harness and break those who have designs against them. They give secure refuge from sudden attack. I favor these because they have been used since antiquity. Still, Niccolo Vitelli (Citta' di Castello, 1482) in our times tore down two forts in Citta di Castello to hold that state. Guido Ubaldo (Urbino, 1504), the Duke Urbino, returned his state after being of to thrown out by Cesare Borgia and tore down all the forts of the province believing it less easy lose dominion without them. to The Bentivogli on returning to Bologna in 1511 also did this. to Forts are useful or not according the times. They help in one way and are handicaps in another way. I will make clear how this is so. The Prince who fears his own people more than foreign ene.mies needs to build forts. Those who fear the foreign enemy more should forget forts. The Sforza's castle in Milan has caused and will cause more wars than anything else in that state. The best is to the fortress not be hated by public. Even while you have forts and as long as the public hates you, they will not save you. If the populace has arms, they will never lack foreigners to help them. In our times, one sees few occasions when forts have helped the Princes except in the case of the Countess of Forl�. When her husband, Count Girolamo died (1488) she escaped into the fort to wait the help of Ludovico the Black of Milan, and re.covered her state. The situation was such that foreigners could not reinforce the populace. However, when Cesare Borgia at.tacked the fortress did
