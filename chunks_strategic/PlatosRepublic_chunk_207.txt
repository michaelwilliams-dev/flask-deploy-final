a poor man, even ifhe � �were a more skilled pilot-" "They would make a poor sailing," he said. "Isn't this also so for any other kind of rule watsoever?" "So I suppose, at least." "Except for a city?" I said. "Or does it also apply to a city?" "Certainly," he said, "most of all, insofar as it is the hardest and greatest kind of rule." "Then oligarchy would contain this one mistake that is of such proportions." "It looks like it." "And what about this? Is this a lesser mistake than the former one?" "What?" "Such a city's not being one but of necessity two, the city of the poor and the city of the rich, dwelling together in the same place, ever plotting against each other." "No, by Zeus," he said, "that's no less of a mistake." "And further, this isn't a fine thing: their being perhaps unable to fight any war, first, on account of being compelled either to use the multitude armed and be more afraid of it than the enemy, or not to use it and thus show up as true oligarchs11 on the field of battle; and, besides, on account of their not being willing to contribute money be? cause they love it."

"Reflect on this. When such a man was wealthy and was spending, was he then of any more profit to the city with respect to the functions we were mentioning just now? Or did he seem to belong to the rulers whi]e in truth he was neither a ruler nor a servant of the city but; spender of his means?" "That's the way it was," he said, "he seemed, but was nothing other than a spender." "Do you wish us," I said, "to say of him that, as a drone growing up in a cell is a disease of a hive, such a man growing up in a house is a drone and a disease of a city?"
