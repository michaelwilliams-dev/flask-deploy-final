himanunreliable subject ofrulers. Socrates charges Achilles with loveofmoney, ofbeing mercenary. Superficially this isunfair. He isnotavaricious; itisPhoenix who suggests thatheaccept gifts,and notbecause oftheirvalue butbecause theywould beevidence ofAga- memnon's humiliation. Achilles does notfollow theadvice. But ina deeper sense, itisjust toaccuse Achilles ofattaching undue sig- nificance toproperty, forhedoes destroy hisfriends andcountrymen because hispossessions havebeen taken fromhimbytheruler. Such a manwould make apoor citizen ofthegood regime which isbeing founded. Initthere isnoprivate property andtherulers decide what belongs toaman. Achilles would resist them, ashedidAgamemnon, claiming that itisjustthathekeepwhat belongs tohim.Hisresistance toAgamemnon appears tostemfromnoble pride, butthatpride has its roots inexcessive loveofone'sown. Spiritedness isthecause ofphe- nomena asdiverse askicking thechair overwhich onehasstumbled, disobedience torulers, punishment ofphilosophers, andinsolence to gods; andthetruecharacter ofthesephenomena canonlybeseen in theircommon source. The realproblem treated inthese passages is. 356 ] Interpretive Essay therefore, notthatofmaking theguardians courageous butofconverting thatprimitive courage they possess bynature into civilcourage. And that isthework ofapoetry which leads tomoderation. The pure form ofspiritedness— that exhibited byAchilles —implies acertain "tragic view oflifeand theworld," accord- ingtowhich justice receives noreward ineternity, andnoble things arenomore supported bynature than base ones.The only cure forthis illness isthatphilosophy which consists of"learning how to die," thephilosophy ofwhich Socrates wasthemaster. Philosophy leads tolackofconcern with one'sown; itisconcerned with things that arenotthreatened, that exist always. The activity ofphilosophy— the soul's contemplation oftheprinciples ofallthings— brings with ita pleasure ofapurity andintensity thatcauses allother pleasures topale. Forthephilosopher, living asmostmendoisequivalent toliving in Hades asconceived bymostmen.Heneed notliveaccording tomyths which assure thepermanence andsignificance ofthings which arenot permanent orsignificant. Death isovercome byalackofconcern with one's individual fate,byforgetting it,inthecontemplation ofeternity. This isalifebothnoble andreasonable. Thecentral quoteamong the seven atthebeginning ofBook IIIrefers toTeiresias, amanwhowas wiseonearthandwhoaloneamong theshades inHades stillpossesses prudence orwisdom. Perhaps evenHomer suggests thatwisdom can exempt amanfrom themiseries ofHades. Butthewarriors arenot wiseandcannot enjoy theconsolation ofphilosophy; therefore they need consoling myths which make death lessfrightening, which lessen theneed forthat furious spiritedness thatconsumes theelement of gentleness initsflames. Socrates' intention inthese passages oftheRepublic ismade clearer byhisbehavior intheApology. When heidentifies himself with Achilles there, heistrying toimpress hisaudience with hisdedication tophilosophy; andnothing impresses thevulgar somuch asamanwho iswilling todieforacause. Therefore Socrates assimilates himself to themost popular example ofsuch aman.Heindicates thatthemem- bersofthejury aremenwho feardeath andthathehimself does not. The jurors arelikeAchilles inasmuch asthey hold that property, family, friends, andcityarethegood things. Theonlywaytheycould overcome their fearofdeath, their fearofthelossofthese perishable things, isasAchilles did—indefense ofthose things, indefense oftheir own.Butthisspirited defense ofone'sown isprecisely what Socrates is suffering from;heisbeingcondemned because hethreatens Athens. Soc- rates'ownfearlessness stems from other sources. After hiscondemnation [357 ] THEREPUBLIC hedivides hisjurors intotwogroups, thosewhohadvoted forcondemna- tionandthosewhohadvoted foracquittal. Totheformer hespeaks di- rectly andintheir oviTiterms. They assume thatdeath istheworst thine andsohethreatens them; they willsuffer forwhat theyhave done, and suffer what theymost fear.Their anger willnotprotect them; Socrates* death willprecipitate theworst rather thanfend itoff.Tothosewho voted foracquittal hetellsconsoling myths totheeffect thatdeath is nottobefeared. They aregentle men. Although theydidnotunder- stand him, theywere favorably disposed tohim.Hestrengtheiis that gentleness within thembyweakening thefearswhich would cause them tohate thecosmopolitanism oftheaccused man. Thus, imitating the function oftragedy, Socrates attempts topurge them ofthepityand fearwhich canlead tofanaticism andenables them toshare something ofhisoviTicalm without knowing itssource. Themyths hetells the jurorswhobelieved himtobeinnocent areakin tothose hewants the poets totellthewarriors, who arepotential jurors. Achilles andSoc- rates
