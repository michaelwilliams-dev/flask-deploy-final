P. sixru CEl\'TURY 13<:. 96 3LAW 13TRANSGRESSION OFTHE LAW Intheearlyfourteenth century,ayoungman named Castruccio Castracani rose from therank ofcommon soldier tobecome lord ofthegreat cityof Lucca, Italy.One ofthe most powerfulfamilies inthecity, thePoggios, had been instrumental inhisclimb (which succeeded through treachery andbloodshed), butafter hecame topower, theycame tofeel hehad for» gotten them. Hisambition outweighed anygratitudehefelt. In1325, while Castruccio wasaway fighting Lucca’s main rival, Florence, thePoggios conspiredwith other noble families inthecitytoridthemselves ofthis troublesome and ambitious prince. Mountinganinsurrection, theplottersattacked andmurdered thegov- ernor whom Castruccio had leftbehind torule thecity.Riots broke out, and theCastmccio supportersand thePoggio supporterswere poisedtodo battle, Attheheight ofthetension, however, Stefano diPoggio,theoldest member ofthefamily, intervened, and made both sides laydown their arms. Apeaceful man, Stefano had nottaken partintheconspiracy.Hehad told hisfamilyitwould end inauseless bloodbath. Now heinsisted he should intercede onthefamily’sbehalf andpersuadeCastruccio tolisten to their complaintsandsatisfytheir demands. Stefano was theoldest and wis- estmember oftheclan, and hisfamily agreedtoputtheir trust inhisdiplcw macyrather than intheirweapons. When news oftherebellion reached Castruccio, hehurried back to Lucca. Bythe time hearrived, however, thefighting had ceased, through Stefa.no’s agency,and he wassurprised bythecity’s calm andpeace.Ste- fano diPoggiohadimaginedthat Castruccio would begratefultohim for hispartinquellingtherebellion, sohepaid theprinceavisit. Heexplained how hehadbrought peace,then beggedforCastruccio’smercy.Hesaid that therebels inhisfamilywere young andimpetuous, hungryforpower yetinexperienced;herecalled hisfamily’s past generositytoCastzuccio. Forallthese reasons, hesaid, thegreat prince should pardonthePoggios and listen totheir complaints. This, hesaid, was theonly justthingtodo, since thefamilyhadwillinglylaid down their arms and had always sup- portedhim. Castmccio listened patiently.Heseemed nottheslightest bitangryor resentful. Instead, hetold Stefano torest assured thatjusticewould prevail, and heasked him tobringhisentire familytothepalacetotalk over their grievancesand come toanagreement.Astheytook leave ofoneanother, Castruccio said hethanked God forthechance hehad been given toshow hisclemencyand kindness. That eveningtheentire Poggio familycame to thepalace.Castruccio immediatelyhad them imprisonedand afewdays later allwere executed, including Stefano.
