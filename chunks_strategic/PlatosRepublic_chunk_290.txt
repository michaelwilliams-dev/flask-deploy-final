Correcting his earlier statement that the arts are simply neutral, Socrates further asserts that the practitioners of arts are dedicated to goals which they cannot, to the extent they are true to their arts, ignore. Therefore the just man cannot by justice make another man more unjust, and thus cannot harm him. Now Polemar? chus had no such notion in mind when he spoke of harming enemies. What he meant was taking the enemy's property or life, for those are the good things. Socrates' view is perfectly consistent with stealing from or killing an enemy just so long as he is not made more unjust. Soc? rates and Pblemarchus differ about what is truly good. With all of Polemarchus' admiration for justice, it is not the highest thing, not sought for as such. Justice is more of a means to the end of preserving life and property than itself the end of a good life. Polemarchus' definition of justice might be regarded as the rule req? uisite to the satisfaction of collective selfishness: be loyal to the mem? bers of your own group so that you can best take advantage of the out? siders. And, in principle, there is no reason why this selfishness should not be extended to the individual if justice is not good in itself. This is why Socrates is able to claim that this definition, which seems so gentle? manly, is the product of a rich tyrant: if wealth is the goal, then the best way to attain it is by breaking all faith and seizing power in one's city and conquering as many nations as one can. Only if u.s_an_ , nQLl!--me.ans, is it reasonable to be unremittingly just. There is a tension in Polemarchus--of which he is unaware-be? tween his love of property and his love of justice. This is what Socrates exposes and what Thrasymachus is about to exploit. Justice, Thrasyma? chus says, is the morality of a band of robbers who are face to face with their victims, and only a simpleton would be duped into making some? thing more of it.-Polemarchus is in an untenable position somewhere between utter selfishness and total dedication to the common good. Gentlemanly morality is self-contradictory, and the goods desired by the gentlemen would, if he were clear-sighted, lead in the direction of tyranny. Thrasymachus continues on the road to it, a road to which Soc? rates' questions have directed him. (336b-354b) Thrasymachus bursts violently into the discussion. He is angry because Socrates and Polemarchus had been engaged in a dialogue. He sees this as a form of weakness. The participants ina dialogue obey certain rules which, like laws, govern their associationï¿½ they seek a common agreement instead of trying to win a victory The very art of dialectic seems to impose a kind of justice on those who practice it, whereas rhetoric, the art of making long speeches without being questioned-Thrasymachus' art-is adapted to self? aggrandizement. Thrasymachus sees dialectic as an opponent of rhetoric and
