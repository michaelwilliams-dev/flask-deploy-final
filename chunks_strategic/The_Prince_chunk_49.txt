, his tenure was compromised from the beginning . It should be noted here that hatred is aroused by good actions as well as evil actions . Therefore , as I said before , often a Prince to maintain the state is forced to act badly. When the general will , of the populace , the military, or the nobles , whatever, that you need to rule is corrupt you have to humor it . Good deeds will then THE PRINCE � 103 On the other hand , turning to Commodius , Severius , Anton.ino Caracalla and Massimino , they were all cruel and rapacious . In order to please the military, they tolerated any injury to the populace . All of them, except Severius , ended badly. Severius , al.though he favored the soldiers , was a man of virtue and he was able to reign successfully because his virtue gained the respect at least of both the populace and the army, so that the populace was at least pacified and mute , while the soldiers were admiring and satisfied . Since his actions for a new Prince were notable , I'd like to briefly show how Severius knew how to use the qualities of both the fox and the lion which I said before that a Prince should imitate . Learning the treachery of Emperor Julianus when he was in ancient Illiria, he persuaded his army when he was captain that he would do well to go to Rome to avenge the death of Pertinacius , who had been killed by the Pretorian guard . With this excuse but betraying no ambition to be Emperor , he moved his army against Rome . He was in Italy before they knew he had left . Arriving in Rome , he was out of fear elected Emperor as soon as Julian was dead. With this beginning, two difficulties faced Severius who wanted to lead the whole state . One was in Asia, where Pescen.nius (governor of Syria, (d.194 ) , head of the Asian armies , had called himself emperor , and the other in the West, where Albinus (British commander, (d . 197) also aspired to be Emperor. Severius, realizing it would be difficult to fight two fronts , de.cided to fight Pescennius and deceive Albinus . He wrote Albinus that though he was elected Emperor by the Senate he wanted to share the honor with him, giving him the title of Ceasar, and by deliberation of the Senate making him his equal . Albinus ac.cepted all this as real . But once Severius had put Pescennius to 104 � Niccol� Machiavelli death, and reestablished peace in the East, as soon as he returned to Rome he told the Senate that Albinus was not grateful of the honor he had received and tried to kill him. He was thus obliged to go and punish Albinus. He went to France, stripped him of his state and killed him. Whoever examines
