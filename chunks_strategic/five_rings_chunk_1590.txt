In1865 thePrussian councillor Otto von Bismarck wanted Austria to LAW 21;I59 I603LAW 2]signacertain treaty.The treatywastotallyintheinterests ofPrussia and against the interests ofAustria, and Bismarck would have tostrategizeto gettheAusmans toagreetoitButtheAustrian negotiator,Count Blorne, was anavidcardplayer.Hisparticular gamewasquinze,and he often said that hecould judgeaman’s character bythewayheplayed quinze.Bis- marck knew ofthissaying ofBlome’s. Thenight before thenegotiationswere tobegin,Bismarck innocently engagedBlome inagame ofquinze.The Prussian would later write, “That was theverylast time Iever played quinze. Iplayedsorecklesslythat everyonewas astonished. Ilostseveral thousand talers [thecurrency ofthe time], butIsucceeded infooling [Blome], forhebelieved me tobemore venturesome than Iamand Igave way.”Besides appearing reckless, Bis- marck alsoplayedthewitless fool, sayingridiculous things andbumbling about with asurplus ofnervousenergy. Allthis made Blome feel hehadgadiered valuable information. He knew that Bismarck wasaggressive———thePrussian alreadyhad that reputa- tion, and theway heplayedhad confirmed it.And aggressive men, Blome knew, can befoolish and rash. Accordingly,when thetime came toSign thetreaty,Blome thought hehad theadvantage. Aheedless fool like Bis- marck, hethought, isincapable ofcold—blooded calculation anddeception, soheonly glancedatthetreatybefore signingit—he failed toread thefine print.Assoon astheink wasdry,ajoyousBismarck exclaimed inhisface, “Well, Icould never have believed thatIshould find anAustrian diplomat willing tosignthat document!” The Chinese have aphrase, “Masqueraclingasaswine tokill the tiger.” This refers toanancient hunting techniqueinwhich thehunter clothes himself inthehide and snout ofapig,and mimics itsgrunting.
