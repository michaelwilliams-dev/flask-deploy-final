Several weeks later,aman named Louis Janin,thebestmining expert inthecountry,met theprospectorsinSan Francisco. _]ani.nwas aborn skeptic who was determined tomake sure that themine was not afraud. Accompanying janinwere Harpending,and several other interested fi~ nanciers. Aswith theprevious expert,theprospectors ledtheteam through acomplexseries ofcanyons, completely confusingthem astotheir where abouts. Arriving atthesite, thefinanciers watched inamazement asjanin dug the areaup,leveling anthills, turningover boulders, andfindingemer- alds, rubies, sapphires,and most ofalldiamonds. Thediglasted eight days, andbytheend, was convinced: Hetold theinvestors thattheynow possessedtherichest field inmining history. “With ahundred men and proper machinery,"hetoldthem, “Iwould guaranteetosend out onemil lion dollars indiamondsevery thirty days." ReturningtoSan Francisco afewdays later, Ralston, Harpending,and companyacted fast toform a$10million corporation ofprivateinvestors. First, however, theyhad togetridofArnold and Slack. That meant hiding their excitement—they certainlydid not want toreveal thefield’s real value. Sothey played possum. Who knows if_]aninisright, they told the prospectors,the minemay notbe asrich aswethink. This just made the prospectors angry. Tryingadifferent tactic, thefinanciers told thetwo men thatiftheyinsisted onhaving shares inthemine, theywould endupbeing fleeced bytheunscrupulous tycoons and investors who would runthe cor- poration; better, they said, totake the$700,000 alreadyofferecl—an enor» mous sum atthetime—and puttheir greed aside. This theprospectors seemed tounderstand, andtheyfinally agreed totake themoney,inreturn signing therightstothesite over tothefinanciers, andleaving mapstoit. News ofthe minespreadlike wildfire. Prospectorsfanned out across Wyoming. Meanwhile Harpendingandgroup began spendingthemillions theyhad collected from their investors, buying equipment, hiringthebest men inthebusiness, andfurnishing luxurious offices inNew York and San0 Francisco. Afew weeks later, ontheir firsttripback tothesite,theylearned the hard truth: Not asinglediamond orrubywas tobefound. Itwas allafake. Theywere mined. Harpendinghadunwittinglylured therichest men in theworld into thebiggestscam ofthecentury. Interpretation Arnold and Slack pulled offtheir stupendouscon notbyusingafake engi- neer orbribing Tiffany:Alloftheexpertshad been real. Allofthem hon- estlybelieved inthe existence ofthemine and inthevalue ofthe gems. What had fooled them allwasnothingelse than Arnold and Slack them- selves. The two men seemed tobesuch rubes, such hayseeds,sonaive, that no one for aninstant had believed them capable ofanaudacious scam. The prospectorshadsimplyobserved thelaw ofappearingmore stupid than themark-—the deceiver’s First Commandment. Thelogistics ofthe con werequite simple.Months before Arnold and Slack announced the“discovery” ofthediamond mine, theytraveled to Europe,where they purchasedsome realgemsforaround $12,000 (partof themoney they had saved from their daysasgold miners). Theythen salted the“mine” with thesegems,which thefirst expert dug upand broughttoSan Francisco.
