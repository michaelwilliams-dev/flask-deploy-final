weak � so now, ripe for the virtue of it is an Italian spirit. Italy too has fallen into her current piteous state � more abject than the Hebrews, more enslaved than the Persians, more strung out than the Athenians, without a leader, without or.der, conquered, exploited, wounded, weakened, and visited by every sort of devastation. Although we have seen some sparks here and there seemingly favored by God for Italy's redemption. In the course of events, we have seen that such hopes were damned by fortune. Without life, Italy awaits someone to heal her wounds, to put an end to the ran.sacking of Lombardy, to the French partitioning of the kingdom and rape of Tuscany, and to heal the long festering wounds.

God does not want to do everything nor tears from us free will and that part of glory that belongs to us. is It no surprise that some of the worthy Italians mentioned were not able to achieve what is hoped from the illustrious House in of Medici. Nor that from the many revolutions Italy and the of maneuvers war it seems that military virtue is dead. This hap.pened because the ancient orders of Italy no longer sufficed and no one emerged who could initiate new ones. Nothing honors a new man on the rise more than the new laws and ways he can find. Such achievements, when well grounded and grandly de.signed, make him revered and respected. Italy does not lack in it is Ingenuity. Her members have it even when lacking in her Chiefs.
