her to do the following: explain to the son that the principal believed only students who attended class in person could do well. In the principal�s mind, by keeping the boy away from school he was ensuring he would fail. If he did better by working at home than in class, this would embarrass the principal. Better to not try too hard this semester and get on the good side of the principal by proving him right. Of course, such advice was designed to play into his emotions. Now he desired nothing more than to embarrass the principal and so threw himself into his homework with great energy, the goal of the therapist all along. In essence, the idea is not to counter people�s strong emotions but to move with them and find a way to channel them in a productive direction. Use their language: The therapist Milton Erickson (see chapter 3) described the following case that he had treated: A husband came to him for advice, although he seemed quite set on doing what he wanted anyway. He and his wife came from very religious families and had married mostly to please their parents. The husband and wife were very religious as well. Their honeymoon, however, had been a disaster. They found sex very awkward and did not feel like they were in love. The husband decided it was not anyone�s fault but that they should get �a friendly divorce.� Erickson readily agreed with him and suggested exactly how to bring about this �friendly divorce.� He instructed him to reserve a room at a hotel. They were to have one final �friendly� night together before the divorce. They were also to have one last �friendly� glass of champagne, one last �friendly� kiss between them, and so on. These instructions virtually ensured the wife�s seduction by her husband. As Erickson had hoped, the husband followed his instructions, the couple had an exciting evening together, and they happily decided to remain married. Erickson intuited that the husband did not really want a divorce and that the two of them felt awkward because of their religious backgrounds. They were both deeply insecure about their physical desires, yet resistant to any kind of change. Erickson used the husband�s language and his desire for divorce but found a way to gently redirect the energy toward something much different. When you use people�s words back at them, it has a hypnotic effect. How can they not follow what you suggest when it is exactly the words they have used? Use their rigidity: A pawnbroker�s son once came to the great eighteenth-century Zen master Hakuin with the following problem: he wanted to get his father to practice Buddhism, but the man pretended to be too busy with his bookkeeping to have time for even a single chant or prayer. Hakuin knew the pawnbroker�he was an inveterate miser who was only using this as an excuse to avoid religion, which he considered a waste of time. Hakuin
