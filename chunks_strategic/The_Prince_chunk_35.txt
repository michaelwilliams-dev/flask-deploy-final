has to have are laws and a strong army. Good laws do not come without strong security; where the army is strong, one needs good laws. Leaving the question of good laws aside, let's discuss armies. The forces a Prince uses to defend his state are either his own, or they are mercenaries, auxiliaries, or mixed forces. Mercenaries and auxiliaries are useless and dangerous. A state based on mer.cenary forces will never be solid or secure. Mercenary forces are not united; they are ambitious, undisciplined, and disloyal. They are careful of friends, villainous with enemies, not fearing God, and faithless among men. Attack and defeat are the same to them. In peacetime, they rob you. In war, the enemy ruins you. The rea.son is that nothing keeps them in camp except a miserable wage, not enough for them to They want to be soldiers as die for you. long as there is no war, but when war comes, they flee and run away. This does not take much convincing because the ruin of Italy is not from anything but being in the hands, for many years, of mercenary troops. Left alone they made some advances, but as soon as foreigners came, they showed their true colors. When Charles of France showed up they called it the "war of chalk" � because white chalk marked the houses where he could lodge his troops. He, who said, like Giovanni Savonarola, that defeat was 76� Niccol� Machiavelli due to our fault and sins, was telling it right. But it wasn't those sins, but the ones that I relate. And because the Princes sent the mercenaries, they suffered the consequences. I'd like to show even better the weakness of such armies. Mercenary captains are either excellent soldiers, or not. If they are, you can't trust them because they aspire to glory themselves � either by putting you down, or putting others down that you don�t intend harm. If they are no good as soldiers, they ruin to If you anyway. someone answers this happens no matter who the soldier is, I have to answer that there is a difference in how ar.mies work under Princes or in Republics. The Prince must be his own captain; in a Republic, one of the citizens assumes the cap.taincy. When he is not a valiant man, he has to be replaced. When he is valiant, it is hard to contain him within the law. But from experience, one sees Princes and Republican armies make pro.gress, Mercenaries do nothing but damage. An armed Republic falls to its own dictator from within less easily than an army raised from outside. Rome and Sparta lasted many centuries armed and free. The Swiss are armed and free. Mercenary armies of antiquity are, for example, the Carthaginians who were oppressed by their own mercenaries after the first Punic campaign against Rome (241 of B.C.), when they still had their own captains.
