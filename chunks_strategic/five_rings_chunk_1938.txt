"Not inmyopinion," hesaid."Otherwise hevi^ouldn't have seta blind leader^^ overthechorus andhonored itabove all." "Good," Isaid."But consider this.Won't w^esaythatdue tolack ofeducation dronelike desires come tobeinhim—some ofthebeggar c variety, others ofthewrongdoing variety—^held dovioi forcibly byhis general diligence." "Surely," hesaid. "Doyouknow," Isaid, "towhatyoumust look ifyouwant tosee thewrongdoings ofthesemen?" "Towhat?" hesaid. "To their guardianship oforphans andanyoccasion ofthekind thatcomes theirwayandgivesthem aconsiderable license todoin- justice." Irue. "Isn't itplain from thisthatwhen such amanhasagood reputa- tion inother contractual relations—^because heseems tobejust—he is d forcibly holding dovioi bad desires, which arethere, withsome decent partofhimself Heholdsthem dovioi notbypersuading them thatthey 'had better not'norbytaming them vdthargument, butbynecessity andfear,doing sobecause hetrembles forhiswhole substance." "Verymuch so,"hesaid. "And, byZeus,myfriend," Isaid, "you'll findthedesires that are akin tothedrone present inmost ofthemwhen theyhave tospend what belongs toothers." "Indeed youmost certainly will," hesaid. "Such aman, therefore, wouldn't befreefrom faction viithin him- self;norwould hebesimply one,butrather insome sense twofold, al- [232 ] fi^ookVin I554a-55Sd socrates Adeimantus though forthemost part hisbetter desires would master hisworse 554e desires." Ihats so. "Then onthisaccount, Isuppose such amanwould bemore graceful thanmany, butthetruevirtue ofthesingle-minded andhar- monized soulwould escape farfrom him." "That'smyopinion." "Furthermore, thestingyman isapoor contestant when with his private means hecompetes forsome victory oranyother noble object 555a ofambition inacity; he'snotwilling tospend money forthesakeof good reputation oranysuch contests.

"Quite so,"hesaid. "Dowethen stilldoubt," Isaid, "that thestingy, money-making man, invirtue ofhislikeness, corresponds totheoligarchic city?" "Not atall,"hesaid. b "Then, democracy, must, as itseems, beconsidered next— in whatway itcomes intobeing and,oncecome intobeing, what itis like— sothatwhenweknow thecharacter ofsuch aman inhisturn,we canbringhimforward forjudgment." "Inthat," hesaid,"wewould atleastbeproceeding just aswe were." "Doesn't," Isaid, "the transformation from anoligarchy toa democracy takeplace insomething likethefollowing way, asarestilt oftheinsatiable character ofthegood thatoligarchy proposes for it- self—the necessity ofbecoming asrich aspossible?" "How?" hesaid. "Isuppose thatbecause therulers rule initthanks topossessing c much, theyareunwilling tocontrol thoseamong theyouthwhobecome licentious byalawforbidding them tospend andwaste what belongs tothem— inorder thatbybuying andmaking loans ontheproperty ofsuchmen they canbecome richer andmore honored." "That theydoabove all." "Isn't itbynow plain that it'snotpossible tohonor wealth ina cityand atthesame timeadequately tomaintain moderation among thecitizens, butoneortheother isnecessarily neglected?" d "That's fairly plain," hesaid. "Then, bytheir neglect andencouragement oflicentiousness in oligarchies, theyhavesometimes compelled human beings whoarenot ignoble tobecome poor."^ [233 ] ADEIMANTUS/SOCRATES THEREPUBLIQ 555d "Quite so." "Then Isuppose thesemen sitidly inthe city, fitted outwith stings and fullyarmed, someowing debts, some dishonored, andsome both, hating andplotting against thosewhoacquired what belongsto themand alltherest too,gripped byaloveofchange." e "That's so."

"Very great indeed," hesaid. "And, atallevents," Isaid, "they aren't vsilling toquench this kind ofevil—asitisbursting intoflame—either bypreventing aman from doing what hewants with hisproperty, or,alternatively, by instituting another lawthatresolves such cases." "What law?" "The one that takes second place totheformer lawandwhich compels the citizens tocare forvirtue.
