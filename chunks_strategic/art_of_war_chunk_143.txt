weak; while brave in reality, appear to be cowardly�this method was effective against the Huns. LI QUAN Li Quan told a story of how one of the generals of the Han dynasty rebelled and joined forces with the Huns. The emperor sent ten scouts to observe them, and all reported that they could be effectively attacked. The emperor then sent one Lou Jing, who reported that, on the contrary, the Huns could not be effectively attacked. When the emperor asked him why, he replied, �When two countries are at a standoff, they should be flaunting their strengths. When I went, all I saw were the feeble and the elderly�surely they are �competent yet appearing to be incompetent,� so I consider it unfeasible to attack.� The emperor was wroth. He punished Lou Jing for getting in his way, and personally set out with a large contingent. They were hemmed in by the Huns, however, and cut off from supplies for seven days. This, concluded Li, is the meaning of an army appearing to be weak. DU MU This is a matter of deceptively concealing your state. You should not let the opponent see what state you are in, for if the enemy sees your condition, he will surely have a response. An example of this is when the Huns let the emissaries of Han only see the feeble and the old.

Master Sun When you are going to attack nearby, make it look as if you are going to go a long way; when you are going to attack far away, make it look as if you are going just a short distance. LI QUAN This is to cause the opponent to be unprepared. Master Sun Draw them in with the prospect of gain, take them by confusion. MEI YAOCHEN If they are greedy, lure them with goods. ZHANG YU Show them a little prospect of gain to lure them, then attack and overcome them. DU MU When the enemy is confused, you can use this opportunity to take them. JIA LIN I would have crafty interlopers confuse them, then wait for them to fall into disarray in order to take them. ZHANG YU Use deception to throw them into confusion, lead them on in order to take them. When the states of Wu and Yue were at war with each other, Wu sent out three
