Han can be revived.� Liu Bei agreed, and it turned out as planned. Fighting Schemes Liu Ji said: Whenever opponents begin to scheme, attack accordingly, foiling their plans so that they give up. The rule is �The superior military artist strikes while schemes are being laid� (Sun Tzu, The Art of War, �Planning a Siege�). Around 500 B.C.E., in the Spring and Autumn era, the lord of Jin wanted to attack the state of Qi. He sent an emissary to Qi to observe the government there. The lord of Qi wined and dined the emissary. The wine flowed freely, and the emissary asked to drink from the lord�s cup. This is a gesture of familiarity, and such a request under such circumstances is an insult. The lord said, �I offer my cup to my guest.� After the emissary of Jin had drunk from the lord�s cup, one of the eminent nobles of the Qi court came forward, removed it, and personally continued to serve wine to the emissary in another cup. Now the emissary, feigning inebriation, stood up in displeasure and said to the highest cabinet official at the court of Qi, �I desire the music of the duke of Zhou. If you can play it, I will dance it for you.� The duke of Zhou was the founder of the Zhou dynasty, which was beginning to disintegrate in the Spring and Autumn era. The high official of Qi said, �I have not practiced it.� The emissary of Jin left. The Lord of Qi said to the noble and the official, �Jin is a big state. Now you have angered the emissary of that great state, who came to observe our government. What shall we do?� The eminent noble said, �I could see the emissary was not ignorant of etiquette, so I would not go along with him when he tried to shame our state.� The cabinet official said, �The music of the duke of Zhou is the music of the national leader. Only a ruler dances it. That emissary is the servant of another, yet he wanted to dance the music of leaders�that is why I didn�t perform.� As for the emissary, he went back and reported to the lord of Jin. He said, �Qi cannot be attacked at this time. I tried to insult their lord, and a court noble knew it; I tried to violate their etiquette, and the highest official perceived it.� Confucius said of the court noble who took the lord�s cup from the emissary that he �could stop a thrust from a thousand miles away without leaving the table.� Espionage and Warfare Liu Ji said: Whenever you move against anyone, before mobilizing the army first use spies to see whether the opponents are many or few, empty or full, active or quiet. Then you can be very successful and never fail to win in battle. The rule is �Spies are useful everywhere� (Sun Tzu, The Art of War, �On the Use of Spies�). In
