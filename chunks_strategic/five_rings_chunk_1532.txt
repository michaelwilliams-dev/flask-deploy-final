magnate George Westinghouse, who had started his own electricity company. Westinghouse completely funded Tesla’: research and offered him agenerous royalty agreementon future profits. The ACsystemTesla developedisstillthestandard today-— butafter patentswere filed inhisname, other scientists came forward to take credit fortheinvention, claimingthattheyhad laid thegroundwork forhim. His name was lostintheshuffle, and the publiccame toassociate theinvention with Westinghousehimself. Ayear later, Westinghousewas caughtin amkeover bid from _}.Pierpont Morgan, who made him rescind thegenerous royaltycontract hehadsigned with Tesla. Westinghouse explainedtothescientist that his company would not survive ifithad topayhim hisfullroyalties;heper- suaded Tesla toacceptabuyout ofhispatentsfor$216,000-—a large sum, nodoubt, butfarlessthan the$12million theywere worth atthetime. The financiers had divested Tesla oftheriches, thepatents, andessentiallythe credit forthegreatest invention ofhiscareer. The name ofGuglielmo Marconi isforever linked with theinvention ofradio. Butfewknow that inproducinghisinvention-——he broadcast asig- nal across theEnglish Channel in1899--Marconi made useofapatent Tesla had filed in1897, and that hiswork dependedonTesla’.-i research. Once againTesla received nomoneyand nocredit. Tesla invented anin- duction motor aswell astheACpower system,and heisthereal“father of radio.” Yet none ofthese discoveries bear his name. As anold man, he lived inpoverty.THE T()RT()lSE.
