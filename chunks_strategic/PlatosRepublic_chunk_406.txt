of men, a politically relevant class. This passage presents one element in the definition of that class which is so important for political life. It is dominated by opinions which give too much weight to money. The many have a distorted sense of the importance of the equipment necessary for a good life; they iden? tify the condition of happiness with happiness itself. Socrates finally calls the lowest class, as well as the desiring part of the soul, the money-making part (44Ia). This is one of the most massive political facts, and, in Plato's way of teaching, it becomes clear only through fidelity to his clear language. 14. The Greek word is mythos; first meaning no Ir!Ore than "a speech" (as in Homer), it comes to mean "a story," very often one connected with religious traditions. The poets are the makersï¿½of the mutlwi; the meaning and reliability of mythoi is an important question in Plato. The term will always be translated thus. 15. This is the first time one of the words in the family of dikaiosyne, "justice," is used in the dialogue. It arises, as it were, accidentally during a discussion of other questions. Justice gradually becomes the problem of the dialogue, to the exclusion of other questions; hence the traditional subtitle of the book, On the Just. Dikaiosyne is justice, the virtue; dikaion is what is just or right, the thing or act to which the virtue is related. 16. In conversation, where we would say "good," or "right," or "true," the Greeks said "you speak well," etc. This has been re11dered as "what you say is good," etc. Characteristically there are four possible alternatives used in this formula, meaning true, correct, good, and fine, fair, or noble (kalon). The only ones that present a problem are the last two. They have in the past been translated and understood as though they were equivalent, but there is a nuance of difference which should be preserved. Something that has been said can be good without being fine or noble, just as fin or. nobl ' , is not necessarily good or true. Our idiom does not reveal this differenec:; : but it does not follow therefore that the distinction is not relevant to- Socratic thought. The kalon is a crucial and ambiguous term in classical moral thought altogether, and we have no precise equivalent for it. It means, in the first place, fair or beautiful, and expresses nobility when qualifying speech or deed. It is always rendered as fine, fair or beautiful; in the formula under discussion, it is almost always rendered as fine. This may often sound strange to our ears, but it is well to maintain the distinction in the hope of becoming aware of a subtlety in Socrates' style, a subtlety based on a forgotten moral viewpoint. The passage to which this note refers is a case in point. For a precise discus? sion of the difference in the Platonic usages of these terms, cf. Seth
