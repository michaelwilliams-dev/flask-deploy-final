to armies are they lacking. It all hangs on the witness of the chiefs. Those who are in the know are not obeyed. It seems as if everybody is in the know because there is not one who stands out, on virtue or on fortune, to whom the others might bow. Be.cause of this, for a long time in the many wars of the past, for twenty years the Italian army has always done poorly. Witness to this are the battles of Fornovo di Taro, Alexandria, Capua, Gen.oa, Vaila', Bologna and Mestre. If your house wants to follow the great role models of history to redeem the state, it means first of all, as the basis of every un.dertaking, to furnish your own arms. Only your own soldiers will THE PRINCE �-133 be faithful, true , and brave . No matter how valiant each soldier is , together they'll be more effective if their own Prince commands them . Thus , he honors and engages them. It is therefore necessary to arm in order for Italic virtue to defend itself against foreigners . Although Swiss and Spanish soldiers are considered mighty fierce , both lack something that a third order can trust to oppose and vanquish them , The Spanish fear the cavalry, and the Swiss fear the infantry in hand to hand combat. Experience has shown that the Spanish cannot withstand the French cavalry, and Span.ish infantry has overwhelmed the Swiss . Although this has not been seen wholesale , it was seen in glimpses at Ravenna when the Spanish opposed the German ranks � which are modeled the same as the Swiss . The Spaniards with their agility and the spear- pointed shield got under the spears of the Germans , who were helpless to stop them. If the cavalry had not driven them back, they would have decimated everyone . Knowing the weaknesses ofthese forces , it would be possible to model a new force that could sustain a cav.alry rush and not fear hand to hand combat. This can be done with innovative arms and by fielding the troops differently. Such innovations give a new Prince both greatness and repute . This moment of history should be grasped so that Italy finally finds her redeemer. I cannot stress more how welcome he would be in all provinces where this foreign horde has descended . He would be received with a vengeance , with firm faith, with sympathy, and tears . What doors would not open? What populace would not offer obedience ? Who would envy him? What Italian would deny him allegiance? The domination of the barbarian stinks . May your illustrious house rise and assume the mantle of courage and hope that stems from a just cause , so that under its Insignia, this land can be ennobled and under its auspices Petrarch's words can be validated : 134 Niccol� Machiavelli Prender� l'arme, e fia il combatter corto: Che l'antico valore Ne gli Italici cor
