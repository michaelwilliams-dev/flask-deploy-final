master this method,72 you will not lose, even alone against twenty or thirty opponents. First of all, because you maintain your vital energy constantly in your strategy73 and you practice the direct way, you will win through your techniques and also through your way of seeing. Since you have free mastery of your body74 as a result of your training, you will win through your body; since your mind is accustomed to this way, you will also win through your mind. Once you reach this stage, how can you be defeated? Regarding grand strategy, you must be victorious through the quality of the people you employ, victorious through the way in which you utilize a great number of people, victorious by behaving correctly yourself in accordance with the way, victorious by ruling your country, victorious in order to feed the people, victorious by applying the law of the world in the best way. Thus it is necessary to know how not to lose to anyone�in any of the ways�and to firmly establish your position and your honor. That is the way of strategy. The twelfth of the fifth month of Year 2 of Shoho [1645] SHINMEN MUSASHI For the Honorable Lord Terao Magonojo The fifth of the second month of Year 7 of Kanbun [1667]75 TERAO YUMEYO KATSUNOBU For the Honorable Lord Yamamoto Gensuke76 Notes Note: References to numbered sources in the Bibliography of this book are cited in parentheses. 1. Niten ichi ryu: ni, �two�; ten, �heaven, universe�; ichi, �one�; ryu, �school.� Niten has several senses: 1. Two heavens. 2. The two heavenly bodies, or the moon god and the sun god. 3.

The term niten evokes two images. We can understand niten as a contraction in which the idea of to, �sword,� is implicit, and this expression then yields the idea of two swords raised toward the sky�or else the two swords, the long and the short, raised toward the sky�symbolizing the two heavenly bodies, or the sun god and the moon god. Later on, the expression Niten-sama (sama means �lord�) was used as a name for Musashi by his admirers. 2. �Way of strategy�: hyoho no michi. 3.
