areinterested inthegood of thewhole cityand itsindividuals, and iftheycommand theartisans as tohowthey aretousetheir arts,nothing further isneeded. Modera- tion,notjustice, causes theartisans toobey therulers. There isnotem- perordisposition ofjustice demanded ofthecitizens. Justice, inthe city atleast,means only thepresence ofthethree other virtues. Nevertheless, minding one'sownbusiness isnotanunilluminating formula forexpressing what isordinarily meant byjustice. Justice seems toinvolve doing good toothers, butthebusybody ormeddler is somehow animperfect type. Inthis city, ifeachdoeswhat properly is histodo,healsodoesgood toothers. Each keeps anddoes hisown while benefiting others. Moreover, thesimplest sense ofjustice, that ex- pressed byCephalus, isalso satisfied here: obedience tothelaw isvin- dicated forthelaws aregood.Hence this city, inwhich justice isnota concern, meets thedemands ofjustice defined byCephalus and Polemarchus who are itsadvocates. And inthiscityThrasymachus will nolonger beable toallege thesame reasons fordespising justice. He willsoon joinSocrates' group offriends. [374 ] Interpretive Essay Socrates nowturns totheinvestigation ofthejustice oftheindivid- ualman, which issocrucial forGlaucon. This investigation quickly moves toadiscussion ofthesoul;bytreating thesoulasthewhole man, Socrates tacitly assumes theirrelevance ofthebody tothequestion of what justice inaman is.HeandGlaucon attempt todetermine whether thesoulhasthree parts, asdoes thecity; ifitdoes, theanalogy would incline them tobelieve thatthey areofthesame character andorder as aretheparts ofacityandthatasoul's virtues arethesame asthose ofa city.They easily distinguish desire andreason asseparate parts ofthe soul.Then, asmight beexpected, thecrucial partandtheonemost difficult todetermine isspiritedness. Isitseparate ordoes itbelong to oneofthetwoother classes? Glaucon gives anobvious answer andone thataccords with hisown experience; itbelongs tothedesiring part. He isprobably most angrywhen hedoesnotgetwhathewants; surely hisspecific form ofspiritedness leads him offtowar inpursuit of satisfaction ofdesire forpleasure andvictory. Socrates responds withan example inwhich spiritedness purportedly overcomes desire. Spirited- ness isambiguous: itmaysupport oroppose bodily desire, oritmayeven itselfbeakindofdesire. ButSocrates goesmuch further. Hetriestomake spiritedness look likealoyal allyofreason, asitwere, reason's army, which forces thedesires along thepathofreason's commands. Socrates actsasthough itwere only inthecases ofthemostperverse kindofman thatspiritedness opposes reason. Hence thesoul isaunity indiversity and isstrictly parallel tothecity.Theanalogy totheauxiliary class inthe citymakes itplausible toassert thatspiritedness isreason's companion andofadistinctly higher order than thedesires. But this isamost "optimistic" account ofspiritedness, onethat accords with thathopefulness about itscontrol which isthecondition ofthefounding ofthecityandthatdepreciation ofthedesires that is necessary tothe city. Socrates, inorder toprove thepoint that spiritedness isdifferent from desire andserves tocontrol it,tellsthe story ofacertain Leontius who, onhiswayuptoAthens from the Piraeus, observed thatthere were corpses onthepublic executioner's ground anddesired tolook atthem. Something within himresisted the desire, butafter astruggle, hegavewayandlooked. Hethencursed his eyesandbidthem take their fillof"the fair [ornoble] spectacle." Careful reflection onthisexample reveals that itdoes notsosimply support Socrates' thesis thatspiritedness isessentially anallyofreason. Onemust askwhy spiritedness opposes thedesire tolook atcorpses andbecomes angry with theeyes? Either itmustbebecause thesight of death isrepulsive toitandthus itcooperates withthedesire forlife,or because thecontemplation ofthecorpses ofcriminals isignoble and [375 ] THEREPUBLIC goescounter tothesense ofshame induced byspiritedness. Whatever theexplanation, itsresistance toLeontius doesnotseem rational. Asa matter offact, spiritedness isfighting curiosity, aclose kinofthedesire toknow, either because that desire isopposed byother powerful desires, orbecause itseeks toknow theforbidden. Spiritedness appears tobecapable both ofallying itself with desire andofopposing the quest forknowledge. Inthecitythespirited class, although itseducation presented some difficulties, waslargely salutary; butinthesoul itis more problematic. Socrates, because heistrying topersuade Glaucon tobeagood citizen ofthegood city, giveshimaninadequate account ofspiritedness inthesoulâ€”onewhich gives spiritedness thesame role inthesoul asitperformed inthecity,while forgetting thedifferences between asoulandacity. Primarily, what Socrates chooses toforget inhisincomplete pic- tureofspiritedness asmerely reason's trusty tool
