again, but this time Vollard would pull out lessinteresting works, pretendinghethought they were the same ones. The baffled customers would look atthe new offer- ings, leave tothink them over, and return yetagain.Once againthe same thing would happen:Vollard would showpaintingsoflesser qualitystill. Fi- nally thebuyers would realize theyhad better grabwhat hewasshowing them, because tomorrow theywould have tosettle forsomething worse, perhapsateven higher prices. Avariation onthistechniqueistoraise theprice everytime thebuyer hesitates and another day goes by.This isanexcellent negotiating ployto use onthechronically indecisive, who will fallfortheidea thattheyareget- tingabetter dealtodaythan iftheywait tilltomorrow. The Weak Man onthePrecipice.The weak aretheeasiest tomaneuver bycontrolling their options.Cardinal doRetz, thegreat seventeenth~cen- tury provocateur,served asanunofficial assistant totheDuke ofOrléans, who wasnotoriouslyindecisive. Itwas aconstant struggletoconvince the duke totake action»-—-he would hem andhaw, weightheoptions,and wait tillthelastmoment, giving everyonearound him anulcer. ButRetz discov~ ered awaytohandle him: Hewould describe allsorts ofdangers, exaggep atingthem asmuch aspossible,until theduke saw ayawning abyssin every direction exceptone: the one Retz waspushinghim totake. This tactic issimilar to“Color theChoices,” butwith theweakyou have tobemore aggressive.Work ontheir emotions—use fear and terror topropelthem into action.

This isaclassic convartist technique:You attractyour victims tosome criminal scheme, creatingabond ofblood andguiltbe- tweenyou. They participateinyour deception,commit acrime (orthink theydo-—-see thestory ofSam Geezil inLaw 3),and areeasily manipu- lated. Serge Stavisky,thegreat French con artist ofthe1920s, soentangled thegovernmentinhis scams and swindles that the state did not dare to prosecute him, and “chose” toleave him alone. Itisoften wise toimplicate inyour deceptionsthevery personwho candoyouthemost harm ifyou fail. Their involvement can besubtle—-even ahint oftheir involvement will narrow theiroptionsandbuytheir silence. The Horns ofaDilemma. This idea was demonstrated byGeneral William Sherma.n’s infamous march through Georgia duringtheAmerican Civil War. AlthoughtheConfederates knew what direction Sherman was heading in,theynever knew ifhewould attack from theleft ortheright, for hedivided hisarmyinto twowings--and iftherebels retreated from one wing theyfound themselves facingtheother. This isaclassic triallawyer’s technique: Thelawyerleads thewitnesses todecide between twopossible explanationsofanevent, both ofwhich pokeahole intheir story. They have toanswer thelawyer’s questions, butwhatever they saytheyhurt themselves. Thekeytothis move istostrike quickly: Denythevictim the time tothink ofanescape.Asthey wrigglebetween thehorns ofthe dilemma, they digtheir owngrave. Understand: Inyour struggleswithyour rivals, itwill often benecessary foryoutohurt them. And ifyouareclearlytheagent oftheir punishment, expectacounterat1ack——expect revenge. If,however, theyseem tothem- selaes tobetheagents oftheir own misfortune, they will submitquietly.

Authority:Forthewounds andeveryother evil that men inllictuponthem- selves spontaneously,and oftheir own choice, are inthelongrun less painfulthan those inflicted byothers.
