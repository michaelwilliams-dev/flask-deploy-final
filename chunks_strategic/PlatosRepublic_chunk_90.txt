of gymnastic with music and brings them to his soul in the most proper measure is the one of whom we would most correctly say that he is the most perfectly musical and well harmonized, far more so than of the man who tunes the strings to One another." "That's fitting, Socrates," he said. "Won't we also always need some such man as overseer in the city, Glaucon, if the regime is going to be saved?" "Indeed, we will need him more than anything." b "These, then, would be the models of education and rearing. Why should one go through the dances of such men and the hunts, chases, gymnastic contests, and horseraces? It's pretty plain, surely, that they must follow these models, and they are no longer difficult to dis- cover." "Perhaps," he said, "they aren't." "All right," I said. "After that, what would it be that we must determine? Isn't it who among these men will rule and who be ruled?" "Of course." c "That the rulers must be older and the ruled younger is plain, isn't it?" "Yes, it is." "And that they must be the best among them?" "That's plain, too." "And the best of the farmers, aren't they the most skillful at fa1m? m� g?." "Yes.� "Now since they must be the best of the guardians, mustn't they be the most skillful at guarding the city?" "Mustn't they, to begin with, be prudent in such matters as well as powerful, and, moreover, mustn't they care for the city?" "That's so." d "A man would care most for that which he happened to love." "Necessarily." "And wouldn't he surely love something most when he believed that the same things are advantageous to it and to himself, and when he supposed that if it did well, he too himself would do well along with it, and if it didn't, neither would he?" "That's so," he said. "Then we must select from the other guardians the sort of men who, upon our consideration, from everything in their lives, look as if 412 e 413 a b they were entirely eager to do what they believe to be advantageous to the city and would in no way be willing to do what is not." "Yes," he said, "they would be suitable." "Then, in my opinion, they must be watched at every age to see if they are skillful guardians of this conviction64 and never under the influence of wizardry or force forget and thus banish the opinion that one must do what is best for the city." "What do you mean by 'banishment'?" he said. 'Tll tell you," I said. "It looks to me as though an opinion departs from our minds either willingly or unwillingly; the departure of the false opinion from the man who learns otherwise is willing, that of every true opinion is unwilling." - _ "I understand the case of the willing departure," he said, "but J need to learn about the unwilling." "What?" I
