luck. Their predecessors will choose the best of these children; but, nevertheless, since they are unworthy, when they, in turn, come to the powers of their fathers, they will as guardians first begin to neglect us by having less consideration than is required, first, for music, and, second, for gymnastic; and from there your young will become more unmusical. And rulers chosen from them won't be guar? dians very apt at testing Hesiod's races6 and yours-gold and silver and bronze and iron. And the chaotic mixing of iron with silver and of bronze with gold engenders unlikeness and inharmonious irregularity, which, once they arise, always breed war and hatred in the place where they happen to arise. Faction must always be said to be 'of this ances? try'7 wherever it happens to rise." "And we'll say," he said, "that what the Muses answerï¿½ is right." "Necessarily," I said. "For they are Muses." "What," he said, "do the Muses say next?" "Once faction had arisen," I said, "each of these two races, the iron and bronze, pulled the regime toward money-making and the possession of land, houses, gold, and silver; while the other two, the gold and the silver-not being poor but rich by nature-led the souls toward virtue and the ancient establishment. Struggling and straining against one another, they came to an agreement on a middle way: they distributed land and houses to be held privately, while those who pre? viously were guarded by them as free friends and supporters they then enslaved and held as serfs and domestics; and they occupied themselves with war and with guarding against these men." "In my opinion," he said, "this is the source of this transforma? tion." "Wouldn't this regime," I said, "be a certain middle between aristocracy and oligarchy?" "Most certainly." "This will be the way of the transformation. But once transformed, how will it be governed? Or is it evident that in some things it will imitate the preceding regime; in others oligarchy, because it is a middle; and that it will also have something peculiar to itself'?" "That's the way it is," he said. "In honoring the rulers, and in the abstention of its war-making part from farming and the manual arts and the rest of money-making; in its provision for common meals and caring for gymnastic and the ex? ercise of war-in all such ways won't it imitate the preceding regime?" UYes.;,:, "But in being afraid to bring the wise to the ruling offices-be? cause the men of that kind it possesses are no longer simple and earnest, but mixed-and in leaning toward spirited and simpler men, men naturally more directed to war than to peace; in holding the wiles and stratagems of war in honor; and in spending all its time making war; won't most such aspects be peculiar to this regime?" "Yes.;,:, "And such men," I said, "will desire money just as those in oligar? chies do, and under cover of darkness pay fierce honor to gold
