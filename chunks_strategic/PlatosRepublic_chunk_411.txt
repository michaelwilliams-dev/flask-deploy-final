sense nomos can be understood as the opposite of physis, "nature.") f ,1,1.fi 1 2. Glaucon's account of this story should be compared with'Herodofus� (History, I, g....;.13). , ..\//( 2. Paraphrased from Seven Against Thebes (592). The man it describes wishes to be "best." 2. Seven Against Thebes, 593-594. 3. Literally: "Let a brother stand by a man." 4. Works and Days, 232-234. 5. Odyssey, XIX, 10g:...113. After the second line Adeimantus drops the following line: "Lording over many strong men." Line 114 reads: "All as a result of his good leadership; and the people prosper (live in virtue) under him." 6. Musaeus is a semimythical singer and seer from the heroic times. His poetry is said to have dealt with cosmological themes. He is sometimes alleged to have been the son of Orpheus. By his son, Adeimantus may mean Eumolpus, who, among other things, was reputed to have instituted the Eleu? sinian Mysteries, one of the central Athenian religious observances. His de? scendants were the Eleusinian priests. If it is indeed Eumolpus who is meant, Adeimantus is implicitly criticizing the official Athenian understanding of the future life. A symposium is literally a "drinking party," and a Platonic presentation of such a gathering is to be found in the Symposium. � 11. The expression for prose is composed from words meaning "to speak privately" and could also mean what one says in private. Almost all public speech was written in verse, and Herodotus (443 B.c.) is the first prose writer any of whose works we possess in their entirety.

Adeimantus substitutes "can be moved by prayer" for "can be turned," and he leaves out the line following the first in the original: "And they are surely greater in virtue, honor, and strength." 14. The Greek for initiation, telete, means a "making perfect" and is very close to the word Adeimantus has just used for death, teleute. 15. The quote is attributed to Simonides. 16. A shadow painting is a rough sketch designed to produce an effect at a distance. Perhaps Adeimantus means perspective drawing which gives an impression of depth on a two-dimensional surface. (Cf. 523b; 602d.) 17. Archilochus lived at the end of the eighth and beginning of the sev? enth centuries B.C. He was a lyric poet, famed for his bitter lampoons. Of his works only fragments remain. Apparently the fox epitomized cunning and subtle deception in his works. 18. Most manuscripts read logoi, "speeches," rather than nomoi, "laws," but the manuscript reading "laws"
