But natural forest do not grow in rows, whereas they do generally possess the quality of density or compactness.] 1. In raiding and plundering be like fire, [Cf. SHIH CHING, IV. 3. iv. 6: "Fierce as a blazing fire which no man can check."] is immovability like a mountain. [That is, when holding a position from which the enemy is trying to dis- lodge you, or perhaps, as Tu Yu says, when he is trying to entice you into a trap.] 1. Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt. [Tu Yu quotes a saying of T�ai Kung which has passed into a proverb: "You cannot shut your ears to the thunder or your eyes to the lighting� so rapid are they." Likewise, an attack should be made so quickly that it cannot be parried.] 2For a number of maxims on this head, see "Marshal Turenne" (Longmans, 1907), p. 29. CHAPTER 8. MANEUVERING 64 1. When you plunder a countryside, let the spoil be divided amongst your men; [Sun Tzu wishes to lessen the abuses of indiscriminate plundering by in- sisting that all booty shall be thrown into a common stock, which may afterwards be fairly divided amongst all.] when you capture new territory, cut it up into allotments for the benefit of the soldiery. [Ch�en Hao says "quarter your soldiers on the land, and let them sow and plant it." It is by acting on this principle, and harvesting the lands they invaded, that the Chinese have succeeded in carrying out some of their most memorable and triumphant expeditions, such as that of Pan Ch�ao who penetrated to the Caspian, and in more recent years, those of Fu- k�ang-an and Tso Tsung-t�ang.] 1. Ponder and deliberate before you make a move. [Chang Yu quotes Wei Liao Tzu as saying that we must not break camp until we have gained the resisting power of the enemy and the cleverness of the opposing general. Cf. the "seven comparisons" in I. ss. 13.] 1. He will conquer who has learnt the artifice of deviation. [See supra, SS. 3, 4.] Such is the art of maneuvering. [With these words, the chapter would naturally come to an end. But there now follows a long appendix in the shape of an extract from an earlier book on War, now lost, but apparently extant at the time when Sun Tzu wrote. The style of this fragment is not noticeable different from that of Sun Tzu himself, but no commentator raises a doubt as to its genuineness.] 1. The Book of Army Management says: [It is perhaps significant that none of the earlier commentators give us any information about this work. Mei Yao- Ch�en calls it "an ancient military classic," and Wang Hsi, "an old book on war." Considering the enormous amount of fighting that had gone on for centuries before Sun Tzu�s time between
