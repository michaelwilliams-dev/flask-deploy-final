Hetakes ruling tobemerely ameans totheacquisition of certain things which mostmen believe tobegoodandwhich allserve thebody's desires. Actually hisdesire torule istheexpression ofanin- dependently noble impulse which, iffully developed, would find its satisfaction only incontemplation andwould wish toovercome the body's desires inorder toenjoy itsownpeculiar pleasure undisturbed. Hispassionate nature hasbeen tutored bythecommon opinions about what isgood andbythematerialist philosophy ofwhich hehas heard. Glaucon isthusadangerous manbutalsoaneminently interest- ingandeducable one.Hisdesires leadhimtodespise lawandconven- tion; aslong ashislimitless desires have astheir objects thethings he lists asdesirable inhisspeech, hewilllong fortyranny. But itispre- cisely thisfreedom fromlawandconvention combined with hispassion thatmayenable himtoclimb tothehuman peaks. Asisthecasewith alltheyoungmenmost attractive toSocrates, Glaucon hasapotential forgood orevil.Theconduct ofhiscompanions Critias andAlcibiades, both subverters oftheAthenian democratic regime, caused Socrates to besuspected asacorrupter oftheyouth. Critias andAlcibiades were [345 ] THEREPUBLIC liberated butnoteducated. With Glaucon, wehave theopportunity of seeing how Socrates educates and hiseffect ontheyoung. Heun- dertakes aperilous activity butone fullofpromise. Adeimantus ismuch more moderate than Glaucon, andhe is made apaiiofhisbrother's education. What herepresents isalso necessary tothefounding ofthejustcityaswell astothephilosophic life,both ofwhich arejudicious blendings ofmoderation andcourage ormanliness. Acity, ifitistobewellgoverned, requires citizens whose desires arenottoogreat andarewell controlled; and itmust possess somemenwho arewilling torisk their lives in itsdefense. A philosopher's bodily needs mustbeminimal andhissoulmustbedar- ing.These arethesimplest senses ofmoderation andcourage andthe roletheyplay inacityandaphilosopher. Glaucon, with hismanly in- transigence, makes themost important contribution ofthetwo in- terlocutors; hegives theconversation itspower and itsheight. Glaucon cannot endure hisbrother's satisfaction withwhathecallsacityofsows andcauses anewandluxurious citytobefounded. ButAdeimantus purges thatluxurious cityandmakes itpossible foritsbetter potential toberealized. This firstcity isobviously impossible. Itdepends onanunfounded belief innature's providential generosity, ina"hidden hand" which haiTnonizes private andpublic interest, abelief towhich Adeimantus would liketosubscribe. This city isalsoundesirable, aswillsoon be- come clear.The factthatSocrates saysthat itisthetrue citydoesnot mean thathethinks itcouldcome intobeing orthathewould wish itto doso.Rather, bythisassertion, heimplies thatthecityreally exists to serve thebody andthat this city,devoted tothesatisfaction ofthe simplest desires, sei^ves thebody best.Theemergence ofother forms of desire complicates thecityandbrings misery toit.Butthatcorruption isthecondition ofthegrowth ofmore perfect human beings. Perhaps Socrates' assertion that itisthetrue city isnotincontradiction, butin agreement, with Glaucon's characterization ofitasacityofsows. Glaucon rejects the first citybecause itdoes notappeal tohis taste: hedoes not likethefood. Hismanliness always leadshim to make adirect assault onthegood ashesees it.Hehasbeenpromised a dinner which seems tohavebeenpostponed indefinitely. Atthe first mention ofeating, helooks onthebilloffarewith theeyeofahungry manwhohasadelicate palate andimagines howhewould liketo satisfy hishunger. Hefinds thesimple citydoes notmeet hisgastro- nomic standards; initfood isonlynourishment, only forkeeping men aliveandhealthy. Merely toliveandbehealthy isthewayofsows.Hu- [346 ] Interpretive Essay man beings require more than life;theydemand unnecessary refine- ments andpleasures. Desire causes himtosharpen hisdemands onthe city.Hemaythink hisisonlybodily hunger, but itisaspiritual hunger which willcause him totranscend this cityandleadhimtoward another kind offulfillment. He isgetting anunwilling lesson in austerity, which willaidhiminsublimating hishunger. Hiswishes are always contradictory, forhealways mistakes allofhisgreat longings forbodily desires butcannot findsatisfaction forthem thusunderstood. His firstlongspeech isanother example ofthistendency: while assert- ingthenaturalness ofperfect self-indulgence, hewas atthesame time insisting onanotion ofjustice which isthedirect opposite ofself- indulgence. He isan"idealist," inwhatever direction heturns.Head- mires both themanwho isperfectly self-indulgent andtheonewho is perfectly abstinent; inorder tosatisfy himself hewould have to discover awayoflifewhich combined both great eroticism andgreat moderation. This isanapparent impossibility, buthehasbefore his eyes amanwhohasactually
