this firstquestion. Justice necessarily andprimarily demands aknowledge ofwhat isgood formanandthecommunity; otherwise theknowledge and skills ofthe artsareintheservice of authoritative myths. Now, thisdiscussion withPolemarchus outlines inanegative way what thecharacter oftherequisite knowledge must be.Itcannot be likeanyofthose artswhich arealways present inevery com- munity— shoemaking, weaving, carpentry, etc.This iswhat Socrates meant intheApology when hetoldofhisquest forwisemen. Poetsand statesmen, hefound, knew literally nothing, whereas artisans did in- [321 ] THEREPUBLIC deedknow something. Unfortunately theirknowledge waslimited and partial, andSocrates saidthathewould prefer tobeignorant ashewas thanknowledgeable asthey were. Fortheywere content with their competence andclosed tothelarger questions. Tobeignorant inSoc- rates'way istobeopen tothewhole. The artisans aremodels of knowledge, buttheirkindofknowledge isnotapplicable tothedomain ofpoets andstatesmen. Theproblem istocombine theconcerns of poets andstatesmen with knowledge asartisans possess it.Such knowledge iswhat Socrates isseeking. Thediscussion withPolemarchus leads tothesame result asthe questioning oftheartisans described intheApology. The artisans are found insufficient, andtheinsufficiency ofthearguments hereshows why.These arguments arebased onthepremise that thearts like medicine areself-sufficient; butthis isnot so.Thedoctor canproduce health, butthathealth isgoodhedoesnotlearn from medicine, and similarly with allofthe arts.They dealwith partial goods which presuppose aknowledge ofthewhole good towhich they minister. The error ofthediscussion was tolook foraspecific subject matter for justice, tomake itoneamong many arts, toactasthough onlythedoc- torhadanything tosayabout medicine. Tohelp asickfriend oneneeds notonly adoctor butsomeone whoknows towhom health isfitting and howmany other goods should besacrificed toit,andwhocandirect the doctor todowhat willmost help thepatient. There aremaster arts which rulewhole groups ofministerial artsandarenecessary tothem. These arewhat Aristotle calls architectonic arts.The carpenter, the mason, theroofer, etc.—allareinneed ofanarchitect ifahouse istobe produced. He ismore important thanthey are,heguides them, andhe doesnotneed tobeacarpenter, amason, oraroofer himself. Without thearchitect, alltheother artsconnected withbuilding lackanendand areuseless orworse. Similarly, justice mustbeamaster art,ruling the artswhich produce partial goods soastoserve thewhole good. Inother words, justice mustbeknowledge ofthatgoodwhich none oftheother artsknows butwhich eachpresupposes. Lawgivers actually organize all theartsand telltheir practitioners what theycanandcannot do.What Socrates proposes isalegislative orpolitical science. Ifeach ofthear- tisans obeys thelawestablished byalegislator who iswise inthis science, hewould bejust,andjustice would takecare ofitself inlaw- abiding practice ofthearts.Inthiswaytheartswould provide what is fitting toeachman. Theveryinadequacy ofthisargument, which divides theworld among theartswithout reflecting onthatworld which isdivided, points toanartwhich does so;that artmustbejustice. Hence Socrates teaches [322] Interpretive Essay that inorder tobejustinthefullsenseonemustbeaphilosopher, and thatphilosophy isnecessary tojustice. Philosophy doeshave asubject matter which helps indoing good tofriends andharm toenemies, for it aloneknows what isgood orfitting. And italone isnotneutral, for,by itsvery definition, itseeks thewhole good. Justice inthiswaywould be knowledge, would beuseful, andwould notbeable indifferently topro- duce opposite results. This isthesolution which theargument compels ustoseek.And acommunity ofartisans ruledbyphilosophers would beoneinwhich goodwould bedone tofriends. This solution, however, must wait until later, forPolemarchus really hasnonotion ofwhat philosophy is,and itsdiscovery isimpossible onthislevel ofthought. Thepoetsandthelaws tellPolemarchus theproper place ofeach thing, andthis iswhyheseesnodifficulty indoing good tofriends. His isa prephilosophic world, and itsauthorities must becompletely dis- credited before philosophy canevenbesought. After thoroughly confusing Polemarchus about theway todo good tofriends andharm toenemies, Socrates turns tothequestion of what afriend is.HeandPolemarchus agree thatmen consider as friends those they believe tobegood.Theproblem iswhether they must really begoodmen oronlyseem tobesoinorder tobefriends. Polemarchus answers sensibly thatthereality isnotsoimportant but rather what isthought about it.Almost allmenhave friends, andmany arenotable tojudge thetrue character ofthose they callfriends. Friendship would bevery rare ifboth parties
