Wang Chien kept inside his walls and would not come out, but devoted his whole time and energy to winning the affection and confidence of his men. He took care that they should be well fed, sharing his own meals with them, provided facilities for bathing, and employed every method of judicious indulgence to weld them into a loyal and homogenous body. After some time had elapsed, he told off certain persons to find out how the men were amusing themselves. The answer was, that they were contending with one another in putting the weight and long-jumping. When Wang Chien heard that they were engaged in these athletic pursuits, he knew that their spir- its had been strung up to the required pitch and that they were now ready for fighting. By this time the Ch�u army, after repeating their challenge again and again, had marched away eastwards in disgust.

[Chang Yu says: "If they are in an awkward place together, they will surely exert their united strength to get out of it."] 24. Soldiers when in desperate straits lose the sense of fear. If there is no place of refuge, they will stand firm. If they are in hostile country, they will show a stubborn front. If there is no help for it, they will fight hard. 25. Thus, without waiting to be marshaled, the soldiers will be constantly on the qui vive; without waiting to be asked, they will do your will; [Literally, "without asking, you will get."] without restrictions, they will be faithful; without giving orders, they can be trusted. 26.
