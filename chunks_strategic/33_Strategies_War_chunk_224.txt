or her power from three or four simultaneous sources: money, popularity, skillful maneuvering, some particular advantage he has fostered. Knock out one and he will have to depend more on the others; knock out those and he is lost. Weaken a boxer's legs and he will reel and stagger, and when he does, be merciless. No power can stand without its legs. When the vanes are removed from an arrow, even though the shaft and tip remain it is difficult for the arrow to penetrate deeply. --Ming dynasty strategist Chieh Hsuan (early seventeenth century A.D.)
