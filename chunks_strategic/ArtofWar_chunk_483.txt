105 Lin, understands the words less well as "puts forth every artifice at his command."] 1. He burns his boats and breaks his cooking-pots; like a shepherd driving a flock of sheep, he drives his men this way and that, and nothing knows whither he is going. [Tu Mu says: "The army is only cognizant of orders to advance or retreat; it is ignorant of the ulterior ends of attacking and conquering."] 1. To muster his host and bring it into danger:�this may be termed the busi- ness of the general. [Sun Tzu means that after mobilization there should be no delay in aiming a blow at the enemy�s heart. Note how he returns again and again to this point. Among the warring states of ancient China, desertion was no doubt a much more present fear and serious evil than it is in the armies of today.] 1. The different measures suited to the nine varieties of ground; [Chang Yu says: "One must not be hide-bound in interpreting the rules for the nine varieties of ground.] the expediency of aggressive or defensive tactics; and the fundamental laws of human nature: these are things that must most certainly be studied. 1. When invading hostile territory, the general principle is, that penetrating deeply brings cohesion; penetrating but a short way means dispersion. [Cf. supra, ss. 20.] 2. When you leave your own country behind, and take your army across neighborhood territory, you find yourself on critical ground. [This "ground" is curiously mentioned in VIII. ss. 2, but it does not figure among the Nine Situations or the Six Calamities in chap. X. One�s first impulse would be to translate it distant ground," but this, if we can trust the commentators, is precisely what is not meant here. Mei Yao-ch�en says it is "a position not far enough advanced to be called �facile,� and not near enough to home to be �dispersive,� but something between the two." Wang Hsi says: "It is ground separated from home by an interjacent state, whose territory we have had to cross in order to reach it. Hence, it is incumbent on us to settle our business there quickly." He adds that this position is of rare occurrence, which is the reason why it is not included among the Nine Situations.] When there are means of communication on all four sides, the ground is one of intersecting highways. 1. When you penetrate deeply into a country, it is serious ground. When you penetrate but a little way, it is facile ground. CHAPTER 12. THE NINE SITUATIONS 106 1. When you have the enemy�s strongholds on your rear, and narrow passes in front, it is hemmed-in ground. When there is no place of refuge at all, it is desperate ground. 2. Therefore, on dispersive ground, I would inspire my men with unity of purpose. [This end, according to Tu Mu, is best attained by remaining on the de- fensive, and avoiding battle. Cf. supra, ss. 11.] On facile ground,
