the ideas of our mentors, we must slowly cultivate some distance from them. We begin by gently adapting their ideas to our circumstances, altering them to fit our style and inclinations. As we progress we can become bolder, even focusing on faults or weaknesses in some of their ideas. We slowly mold their knowledge into our own shape. As we grow in confidence and contemplate our independence, we can even grow competitive with the mentor we once worshipped. As Leonardo da Vinci said, �Poor is the apprentice who does not surpass his Master.� 4. Create a back-and-forth dynamic In 1978, a promising lightweight boxer named Freddie Roach traveled to Las Vegas with his father in search of a trainer that could elevate him to the next level. And as previously narrated in chapter 1 (see page 38), Freddie and his father quickly settled on Eddie Futch, one of the most legendary boxing coaches in the field. Futch had a magnificent r�sum�. As a young man he had sparred with Joe Futch had a magnificent r�sum�. As a young man he had sparred with Joe Louis.

Sometimes this worked, but he took a lot of blows, and his career started to sputter. What surprised him several years into the process was that Futch did not really seem to notice this problem of his. With so many fighters in his stable, he tended to keep his distance; he did not give much personalized attention. Finally, in 1986, Roach retired. Living in Vegas and moving from one bad job to another, in his off-hours he began to frequent the gym where he had trained. Soon he was giving advice to fighters and helping out. Without getting paid, he became a de facto assistant to Futch, even directly training a few of the fighters himself. He knew Futch�s system well and had internalized many of the techniques he taught. He added his own wrinkle to the training sessions. He took the mitt work�the large padded gloves that a trainer uses in the ring to practice various punches and combinations with his fighter�to a higher level, creating a longer and more fluid practice session.
