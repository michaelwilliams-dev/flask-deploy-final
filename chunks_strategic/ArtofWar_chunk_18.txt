as Meng Shih of the Liang dyn- asty [502-557]. Others would identify him with Meng K�ang of the 3rd century. He is named in one work as the last of the "Five Commentators," the others being Wei Wu Ti, Tu Mu, Ch�en Hao and Chia Lin. 2. LI CH�UAN of the 8th century was a well-known writer on military tactics. One of his works has been in constant use down to the present day. The T�UNG CHIH mentions "Lives of famous generals from the Chou to the T�ang dynasty" as written by him.41 According to Ch�ao Kung-wu and the T�IEN-I-KO catalogue, he followed a variant of the text of Sun Tzu which differs considerably from those now extant. His notes are mostly short and to the point, and he frequently illustrates his remarks by anecdotes from Chinese history. 3. TU YU (died 812) did not publish a separate commentary on Sun Tzu, his notes being taken from the T�UNG TIEN, the encyclopedic treatise on the Constitution which was his life- work. They are largely repetitions of Ts�ao Kung and Meng Shih, besides which it is believed that he drew on the ancient commentaries of Wang Ling and others. Owing to the peculiar arrangement of T�UNG TIEN, he has to explain each passage on its merits, apart from the context, and sometimes his own explanation does not agree with that of Ts�ao Kung, whom he always quotes first. Though not strictly to be reckoned as one of the "Ten Commentat- ors," he was added to their number by Chi T�ien-pao, being wrongly placed after his grandson Tu Mu. 4. TU MU (803-852) is perhaps the best known as a poet � a bright star even in the glorious galaxy of the T�ang period. We learn from Ch�ao Kung-wu that although he had no practical experience of war, he was extremely fond of dis- cussing the subject, and was moreover well read in the military history of the 39Cf. Catalogue of the library of Fan family at Ningpo: "His commentary is frequently obscure; it fur- nishes a clue, but does not fully develop the meaning." 40WEN HSIEN T�UNG K�AO, ch. 221. 41It is interesting to note that M. Pelliot has recently discovered chapters 1, 4 and 5 of this lost work in the "Grottos of the Thousand Buddhas." See B.E.F.E.O., t. VIII, nos. 3-4, p. 525. CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 19 CH�UN CH�IU and CHAN KUO eras. His notes, therefore, are well worth at- tention. They are very copious, and replete with historical parallels. The gist of Sun Tzu�s work is thus summarized by him: "Practice benevolence and justice, but on the other hand make full use of artifice and measures of expediency." He further declared that all the military triumphs and disasters of the thousand years which had elapsed since Sun Tzu�s death would, upon examination, be found to uphold and corroborate, in every particular, the maxims contained in his book. Tu Mu�s somewhat spiteful charge against Ts�ao Kung has already been
