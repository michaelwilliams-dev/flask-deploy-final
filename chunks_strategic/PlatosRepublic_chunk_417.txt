use of variations of pitch in speaking. Rhythm applies both to music and words and is equivalent to the meter and the accentuation of music following upon it. 9. The word is themis, which is "law" or "right," but it has a certain di? vine connotation lacking in the word nomos. 10. Cf. 363c, note 10. 11. There are several myths about the satyr Marsyas and the flute. The story apparently referred to here is the one concerning the contest between Apollo and Marsyas, the former playing the either and the latter the flute. The Muses judged Apollo the winner. He then proceeded to skin Marsvas alive. 12. The various meters are compounded of feet based on the three basic proportions: the or equal, as in the dactyl-------, spondee - -, and an- apest'"''"'-; the 32, as in the cretic ; and the 2'1, as in the iamb----. and trochee - '"' . The four forms of sound are apparently the notes of the tetrachord, but the exact sense is unsure, as is the case with all the technical details in this passage and the one that succeeds it. Socrates assumes these details to be a part of the common knowledge of anyone liberally educated in music. This is shown by the way in which he addresses himself to Glaucon, who knows it all but for whom the technical knowledge has no visible relation to any human or political experience. 8. Damon is Socrates' musical authority. Cf. Laches, 200b; Alcibiades I, 118c; also, lsocrates, Antidosis, 251. 8. The Greek is diairesis. This is the word used for the activity of discerning the forms or classes to which things belong. It is ï¿½the fundamental task of dialectic to define things according to the natural divisions existing in the world; diairesis is the way of discovering such definitions. Cf. Sophist, 267d. 8. In this passage Socrates speaks in the terms of common sense, es- chewing the l:i.nguage of the spe_ciali t - He tra slates, as it were, the ter? minology into everyday speech, but his usage 1s apparently quite precise. Theenoplion (annored or fit for war) foot was apparently a cretic .,.."_ ) The heroic is apparently a foot that could be composed of either a dactyl (-'"''"') or a spondee (--) because they both have the same value and the sec? ond member of the foot could be made of either two shorts or one long. "Up and down" refers to arsis and thesis. ''The tempo of the foot" refers to the time. The speed with which the verse is read or sung causes it to produce different effects. 8. The words are euschemosyne and aschemosyne. Scheme means "outward appearance," "posture," "attitude," or "bearing." All the terms in the following enumeration of qualities pertaining to music begin with the prefix eu. meaning "good," or a, meaning "lack of," which provides them with a unity not visible in English. 9. The same word is used by Thrasymachus (348c) to describe the
