was de troyed by its own vice, which is disease. : But we shall never admit that the body, which is one thing, is corrupted by the badness of food, which is another thing, if the alien evil does not �� introduce the evil that is naturally connected with the body." "What you say," he said, "is quite right." "Well, then," I said, "according to the same argument, if badness . of body doesn't introduce badness of soul into a soul, we would never admit that a soul is destroyed by an alien evil that does not bring with it .. the specific badness of a soul-that is, we would not admit that one thing is destroyed by the evil of another.,, "That's reasonable," he said. "WeH then, either let's refute what we are saying and show that it's not fine, or, as long as it's unrefuted, let's never assert that by fever, ��. or by another illness, or, again, by slaughter-even if someone cuts the whole body up into the smallest pieces-a soul is ever closer to being destroyed as a result of these things, before someone proves that due to e 610a b 610b C d e 611 a b these sufferings of the body�the sou] itseJf becomes unjuster and unho1ier. But when an a1ien vice comes to be in something e]se and its own pecu1iar vice does not come to be in it, Jet's not permit anyone to assert that a sou] or anything e1se is destroyed." "On the contrary," he said, "no one wi]] ever show that when men are dying their sou]s become unjust due to death." "And,'' I said, ..if someone dares to come to c1ose quarters with the argument and say that the dying man becomes worse and unjuster just so as not to be compened to agree that sou]s are immorta], we sha]J sure]y insist that, if the man who says this says the truth, injustice is fata] to him who has it, even as disease is, and that, since by its nature it ki11s, those who get it die from it-those who get most, more quick]y, those who get Jess, in more Jeisure]y fashion. They wou]d be un1ike the unjust men who, as things now stand, do indeed die from injustice, but at the hands of other men who administer the pena1ty." "By Zeu ," he said, "then injustice won't Jook Jike such a very ter? rib]e thing if it wi11 be fata] to the one who gets it. For it wou]d be a re1ief from eviJs. But I suppose rather that it wm Jook, an to the con? trary, Jike it ki11s other m n, if it can, but makes its possessor very much aJive and, in addition to a1ive, s1eep1ess. So far sure]y, as it seems, does its camp Jie from fataJity." "What you say is fine," I said. "For sure]y, whenever its own badness and its own eviJ are not sufficient to ki11 and destroy a sou], an
