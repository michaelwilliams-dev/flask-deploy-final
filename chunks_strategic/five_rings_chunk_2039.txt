teacher ofthemost important hu- man things. The tacitassumption oftheargument isthat itisbetter to beadoerthan aknower, orthatknowledge isonly tested inaction— in benefits toothermen. Butamoment's reflection makes oneaware thatthese charges against Homer apply atleast aswell toSocrates. Hewasnotalawgiver, aleader inwar, aninventor, oraprofessor inthemanner ofPro- tagoras; therewasalsonowayoflifenamed after Socrates astherewas aPythagorean wayoflife.Hewasworse than neglected byhiscon- temporaries. Yethe,too,understood himself tobewise inhuman things. Theauthority totalkabouthuman things does notcome from thestudy ofanyofthearts,andHomer andSocrates areone intheir neglect oftheartsandtheir divorce from thepractical life.What Soc- ratesshows inthispresentation isthattheordinary standards forjudg- ment oftheworth ofanactivity ordepth ofwisdom arenotapplicable toHomer orhimself. Wisdom hasanother source than art,andthere is another kind ofrelation totheideas than thatoftheartisan. Awise man isjudged, notbyanydeed thatheperforms, butbythequality of hisknowledge. And thatknowledge isnotlikethatoftheartisan who produces something which canbeusedandwho deals with aspecial subject matter. Wisdom issought foritsown sake,and itiscomprehen- sive, interrelating thevarious artsandtheir products. BothHomer and Socrates insomewaypossess thiskind ofknowledge; theybothhave a view ofthewhole. Homer produces aproduct astheartisans do,but thatproduct isdistinguished from theartisans' products inthat it reflects aview ofthewhole, and itsmaker isbyhisverynature aman whomust reflect onthewhole. What Socrates implicitly criticizes Homer for isthathecannot ex- plain thegrounds forthatview ofthewhole orfortheway oflife devoted toknowing it.Homer appears asacelebrator ofheroes, ofmen ofaction, andhence astheir inferior. Speech seems tobesubordinate todeed. Nothing intheHomeric poems indicates thedignity ofthe poet; there arenoheroes whogiveanaccount ofthepoet'sowndoings, nor isthere apicture ofauniverse which makes itpossible tocom- prehend thepossibility ofwisdom. Socrates accuses Homer ofnot reflecting onhimself, andhence making aworld inwhich there isno place forhimself. Hispoem isnotacompendium ofimitations ofthe various artsbecause itisanimated byaview ofthewhole. Butbecause hedoesnotprovide abasis forthatview, because thetruth ofthatview isnotthecenter ofthepoet's concern, Socrates islegitimated intreat- inghim asthough heweremerely auniversal imitator oftheartstobe judged byevery artisan, oranincompetent statesman. This lineofrea- [430 ] Interpretive Essay soning serves topointuptheway inwhichHomer differs from thear- tisans andthemenofaction and islikeSocrates. They arebothdevoted tothemostcomprehensive understanding ofthings. The realquestion, then, iswhat isthesource andstatus oftheview ofthewhole which in- forms Homer's works? Inthenextpartofthediscussion Socrates explores thisquestion. Hehad earlier asserted thatthepainter, or,implicitly, thepoet, isone ofthree craftsmen who inawaymake thesame product andthathe stands farthest ofthethree fromwhat is.Adivine craftsman makes the idea, forexample, ofabed.(The ideaswere inthiscontext understood notaseternal butastheproduct ofart,thus constituting aworld in which artisans ormakers, rather thanknowers, arethehighest human beings.) Ahuman craftsman looks totheideaofabedandmakes a bed.And thepainter orpoet looks tothebedmade bythehuman craftsman andmakes animage ofabed.He isthusanimitator ofan imitator andhisproducts have very little reality. Now, however, Soc- rates abandons thereference totheideas and their maker, andno longer asserts that thecraftsman look toideas intheir making. He substitutes acommon-sense notion forallofthis.Thecraftsman isin- deed dependent, however, notonanideabutonthecommand ofthe manwho uses hisproducts. Thepoet isstill atthebottom, butnow there isahuman being atthetopwho practices what Socrates callsthe user's art.Thehorseman, whoknows theequipment necessary tousing ahorse well,can telltheartisans whatheneeds andgivethem theirim- pulse without knowing their arts;heismore important than they are, andtheendoftheir activity ishisactivity. The user's artcomes closer topoetry andphilosophy inthat it,too,deals with therelations of things and isnotrestricted toanysingle art.Thebroadest such art would betheonethat treats ofhappiness— thelegislator's art.The legislator organizes thewhole citywith aview tothegood life—theend ofallaction— andthevarious artsultimately areguided bytherole their products play inthat life.Thehorseman who told thesad- dlemaker andtheblacksmith whatheneeded, is,inturn, toldbythe general what isneeded from thecavalry; andthegeneral, finally, istold bythestatesmen orthelegislator what thearmymust do.Only the legislator oversees thewhole; andbylooking
