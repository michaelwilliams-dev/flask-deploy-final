Agreat partofhis aura ofgenius,heknew, was at- tributable tohisshrewd abilitytomake themost oftheinsights ofancient, medieval, and Renaissance scientists. Shakespeare borrowed plots,charac- terizations, and even dialoguefrom Plutarch, amongother writers, forhe knew thatnobody surpassedPlutarch inthewritingofsubtle psychology andwitty quotes. Howmanylater writers have intheir turn borrowed from-~plagz'anlzed——Shakespeare? Weallknow how fewoftoday’s politicianswrite their own speeches. Their own words would notwin them asingle vote; their eloquenceand wit, whatever there isofit,theyowe toaspeechwriter. Other people dothework, they take thecredit. Theupside ofthis isthat itisa.kind ofpowerthat isavailable toeveryone.Learn tousetheknowledge ofthe pastandyouwilllook like agenius,even when youarereally justaclever borrower, Writers who have delved into human nature, ancient masters ofstrat- egy,historians ofhuman stupidityandfolly, kingsandqueens who have leamed thehardway how tohandle theburdens ofpower—-their knowl- edgeisgathering dust, waiting foryoutocome and stand ontheir shoul- ders.

President Richard Nixon’s historic visit tothePeople’s Republic ofChina wasoriginallyhisidea, butitmightnever have come off butforthedeftdiploma/cy ofHenry Kissinger. Nor would ithave been as successful without Kissinger’sskills. Stilh when the time came totake credit, Kissinger adroitlyletNixon take thelion’s share. Knowing that the truth would come outlater, hewas careful not tojeopardizehisstandingin theshort term byhogging thelimelight.
