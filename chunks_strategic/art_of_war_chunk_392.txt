can detect these moments of void in your adversary and at this instant attune yourself intentionally to his rhythms; and you can also become aware of the moments of void in your own actions and fill them with a new rhythm. What Musashi means by ma no hyoshi will be dealt with later as part of the more general notion of suki, which refers to a fault or lapse. In the development of technique in the Japanese martial arts, ways of provoking a fault (suki) in one�s opponent play an important role. It is not a matter of finding such a fault in your opponent but of creating it in him by exerting various pressures through your own technique and through your will to attack. � �The opposing cadence,� somuku hyoshi: Somuku means �to turn one�s back on one direction, to go in the opposite direction, to move away� or �to wrong-foot someone.� This expression refers to deliberately not matching the other�s hyoshi in order to forestall an action (either your own or the opponent�s). On the simplest level, this means knowing how to break the hyoshi of an attack by backing off. If you are capable of applying this awareness to your own actions, you can realize, at the moment of unleashing them, that certain attacks are futile, and you then become capable of dropping them in order to stay focused on something more important. � I find a connection between this notion from martial arts practice and Musashi�s fighting style. It is said that Musashi was able to elude the blade of his opponent with great precision, dodging it by a margin of one and a half centimeters. This quality of Musashi�s perception is called mikiri. However, in the documents that are relatively reliable, we find only a single account that would confirm this capability of Musashi�s. In the Nitenki we find the following passage from the account of his duel with Sasaki Kojiro: �Kojiro�s sword cut through the knot of Musashi�s headband, and the headband fell to the ground. Musashi also launched his attack at the same moment and his stroke struck the head of his adversary, who fell immediately.� (2, p. 174) The literal translation of mikiri is: mi, �to look� or �to see,� and kiri, �to cut.� Hence we may translate the term �to see with cutting minuteness� or �to see all the way with a look�; more precisely, we could say �discerning the state of situations or things with incisive rigor.� This incisive rigor is not based just on a static perception of distance, because in the martial arts, distance includes movement�that is why the space of distance becomes fused with cadences. Thus mikiri rests on the accuracy of hyoshi, especially of the somuku hyoshi, which causes the opponent�s attack to fail and leads to a sure victory. That is a first dimension of mikiri. According to Musashi�s logic, which is now familiar to us, mikiri could also be understood on a larger scale.
