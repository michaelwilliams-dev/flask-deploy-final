France. Healways didthings onagrand scale. These efforts preoccupied hissubjects andnewdominions. One thing always ledtoanother sothatmen could never muster time totake action against him. Itbehooves thePrince alsotopromote himself ininternal af- fairs with judicious shows ofhimself, similar toBernabo Visconti ofMilan (1354-1385) who took note ofoutstanding enterprises in civil life,good orbad, andmoved quickly topunish orreward them, getting people totalkofhim. Insuch things, thePrince needs toprofile himself asagreat andwise man. APrince isalways esteemed when hetakes astrong stand against enemies orinfavor offriends. This ploy isalways more favorable than standing neutral. Iftwostrong parties come to 116—Niccolò Machiavelli arms orshow virtuous qualities, youhave tofearthewinner. In either case, itisalways better tocommit yourself openly and wage agood campaign. Inthefirst instance, ifyoudon't show your hand, youalways willbethetarget ofthewinner —andthe loser willtake solace andpleasure inyour plight. Even theloser hasnomore interest inhelping orreceiving you. Who wins wants nodubious friends who won't help himinadversity. Who loses won't touch youeither because youdidnothelp himoutwhen misfortune came. This happened inGreece when Antioch ofSyria (189 B.C.) was deployed there bytheAetolians tochase theRomans. An- tioch sent orators totheAchaeans, who were friends oftheRo- mans, toaskthem tostayoutofit.TheRomans urged them to side with them. TheAchaeans deliberated incouncil where the legate ofAntioch persuaded them toneutrality. TheRoman leg- ateresponded; "The plea foryoutostay neutral could notbe more against your interest. You willbewithout dignity andwith- outthanks thespoil ofthevictor." Italways happens thatsomeone who isnotyour friend will urge youtoneutrality. Your friend willaskyoutotake arms with him. Irresolute Princes almost always follow thepath ofneutral- itytoescape pressing dangers. And almost always, they ruin themselves. ButaPrince, who bravely declares himself infavor ofoneparty, ifthatparty wins, aslong asyoustay strong and remain onhisside, will find thewinner obliging andfriendly. Men arenotsodishonest thatthey oppress youinsuch aneasy waywith ingratitude. Their victories areseldom soclear thatthey don’t have some respect forjustice. Ifyour side loses, your ally willstillreceive you. Hemay help youifhecanandyour for- tunes may riseagain. Inthecase when theparties aresuch that youneed notfearwho wins, stillprudence says youshould stick your neck out.You help ruinsomeone with thehelp ofsomeone elsewho, ifthey were wise, should have helped them. Winning, they remain subject toyou. Their victory would have been im- possible without you. Here itshould benoted aPrince should never take sides with amore powerful party when itoffends oth THE PRINCE —117 ers,except outofabsolute necessity. Invictory, youwillbecome subject tothem. Princes should avoid asmuch aspossible obliga- tions toothers. TheVenetians sided with France against theDuke ofMilan when they could have avoided thatalliance. Itruined them. When itisimpossible toescape thealliance, asitwasfor theFlorentines when thePope andSpain combined towage war onLombardy, thePrince should declare himself asoutlined above. Norshould heever believe thatheistaking sides inasure thing —heshould always beskeptical. This isthenatural state of things. One never cansidestep anuncertainty without stepping intoanother one. Prudence consists inweighing thequalities of theuncertainty, andchoosing thebest ofalternatives. APrince should show love ofvirtue, andrecognize virtuous men andhonor those skilled inanyart.Hemust encourage the citizens toquietly exercise their various disciplines, intrade or agriculture, andinevery other human occupation. Hemust actso thatthisonewillnotfearimproving property because itmight be taken from him, orthatonefears nottoopen trade because of taxes.
