the number of edi- tions which appeared from that time onward so great, especially during the T�ang and Sung dynasties, that it would be surprising if numerous corruptions had not managed 33With Wu Yuan himself the case is just the reverse: � a spurious treatise on war has been fathered on him simply because he was a great general. Here we have an obvious inducement to forgery. Sun Wu, on the other hand, cannot have been widely known to fame in the 5th century. 34From TSO CHUAN: "From the date of King Chao�s accession [515] there was no year in which Ch�u was not attacked by Wu." CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 16 to creep in. Towards the middle of the Sung period, by which time all the chief com- mentaries on Sun Tzu were in existence, a certain Chi T�ien-pao published a work in 15 CHUAN entitled "Sun Tzu with the collected commentaries of ten writers." There was another text, with variant readings put forward by Chu Fu of Ta-hsing, which also had supporters among the scholars of that period; but in the Ming editions, Sun Hsing- yen tells us, these readings were for some reason or other no longer put into circula- tion. Thus, until the end of the 18th century, the text in sole possession of the field was one derived from Chi T�ien-pao�s edition, although no actual copy of that import- ant work was known to have survived. That, therefore, is the text of Sun Tzu which appears in the War section of the great Imperial encyclopedia printed in 1726, the KU CHIN T�U SHU CHI CH�ENG. Another copy at my disposal of what is practically the same text, with slight variations, is that contained in the "Eleven philosophers of the Chou and Ch�in dynasties" [1758]. And the Chinese printed in Capt. Calthrop�s first edition is evidently a similar version which has filtered through Japanese channels. So things remained until Sun Hsing-yen [1752-1818], a distinguished antiquarian and classical scholar, who claimed to be an actual descendant of Sun Wu,35 accidentally discovered a copy of Chi T�ien-pao�s long-lost work, when on a visit to the library of the Hua-yin temple.36 Appended to it was the I SHUO of Cheng Yu-Hsien, men- tioned in the T�UNG CHIH, and also believed to have perished. This is what Sun Hsing-yen designates as the "original edition (or text)" � a rather misleading name, for it cannot by any means claim to set before us the text of Sun Tzu in its pristine purity. Chi T�ien-pao was a careless compiler, and appears to have been content to reproduce the somewhat debased version current in his day, without troubling to collate it with the earliest editions then available. Fortunately, two versions of Sun Tzu, even older than the newly discovered work, were still extant, one buried in the T�UNG TIEN, Tu Yu�s great treatise on the Constitution, the other similarly enshrined in the T�AI P�ING YU LAN encyclopedia. In both the complete text is to
