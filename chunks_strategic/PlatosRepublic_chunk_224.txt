best part by its joy or its pain, but rather leave that best part alone pure and by itself, to consider and to long for the perception of some? thing that it doesn't know, either something that has been, or is, or is going to be; and, third, he soothes the spirited part in the same way and does not fall asleep with his spirit aroused because there are some he got angry at. When a man has silenced these two latter forms and set the third-the one in which prudent thinking comes to be-in motion, and only then takes his rest, you know that in such a state he most lays hold of the truth and at this time the sights that are hostile to law show up least in his dreams." "I suppose," he said, "it's exactly that way.". "Well now, we have been led out of the way and said too much about this. What we wish to recognize is the following: surely some ter? rible, savage, and lawless form of desires is in every man, even in some of us who seem to be ever so measured. And surely this becomes plain in dreams. Now reflect whether I seem to be saying something and whether you agree with me." "I do agree." "Well then, recall the character we attributed to the man of the people. He was presumably produced by being reared from youth by a stingy father who honored only the money-making desires while despis? ing the ones that aren't necessary but exist for the sake of play and showing off.

"That was and is," he said, "the opinion about this kind of man." "Well, then," I said, "asslJille again that such a man, now grown � older, has a young son reared, in turn, in his father's dispositions.'; "I shall assume that.'' "Well, assume further that those same things happen to the son � that also happened to his father and he is drawn to complete hostility to law, though it is named complete freedom by those who are introducing him to it, and that his father and his other relatives bring aid to those middle desires while these dread enchanters and tyrant-makers give aid to the other side.
