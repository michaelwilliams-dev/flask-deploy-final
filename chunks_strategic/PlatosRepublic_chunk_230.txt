he said. "This man," I said, "is not yet, I suppose, the most wretched." "Then who is?" "Perhaps this man will, in your opinion, be even more wretched than the other." "What man?" 571. b "The man," I said, "who is tyrannic and doesn't live out a c private life but has bad luck and by some misfortune is given the occa- - sion to become a tyrant." "I conjecture," he said, "on the basis of what was said before, that what you say is true." "Yes," I said. "But in an argument such as this, one must not just suppose such things but must consider them quite well. For, you know, the consideration is about the greatest thing, a good life and a bad one." "Quite right," he said. "Well, then; consider whether, after all, I am saying anything. In d my opinion we must reflect on it from this point of view." "Which one?"

And wouldn't he himself tum out to be the flatterer of servants?" "He's certainly compelled to," he said, "or else be destroyed." "And," I said, "what if the god settled many other neighbors all around him who won't stand for any man's claiming to be another's master, and if they ever can get their hands on such a one, they subject him to extreme punishments." b. "He would," he said, "I suppose, be in an even greater extreme of evil, watched on all sides by nothing but enemies." "Isn't the tyrant bound in such a prison, he who has a nature such as we described, full of many fears and loves of all kinds? And he, whose soul is so gourmand, alone of the men in the city can't
