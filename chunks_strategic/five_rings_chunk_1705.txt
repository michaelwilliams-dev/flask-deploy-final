Observance V Theantiquedealer Fushimiya,who lived inthecityofEdo(former name forTokyo)intheseventeenth century,once made astopatavillagetea~ house. After enjoyingacupoftea,hespentseveral minutes scrutinizing the cup, which heeventually paid forandtook away with him. Alocal artisan, watching this, waited until Fushimiya lefttheshop,then approached theold woman who owned theteahouse and asked herwho this man was. Shetold himitwasjapan’smost famous connoisseur, antique dealer tothelord of Izurno. The artisan ran outoftheshop, caught upwith Fushimiya, and beggedhim tosellhim thecup,which must clearlybevaluable ifFushimiya judgeditso.Fushimiya laughed heartily: “It’sjustanordinary cupofBizen ware,” heexplained,“and itisnotvaluable atall.The reason Iwaslooking atitwasthat thesteam seemed tohang about itstrangelyandIwondered if there wasn’t aleak somewhere.” (Devotees oftheTeaCeremonywere in- terested inanyodd oraccidental beautyinnature.) Since the artisan still seemed soexcited about it,Fushimiya gave him thecupforfree. The artisan took thecuparound, tryingtofind anexpertwho would appraiseitatahigh price, butsince allofthem recognizeditasanordinary teacuphegotnowhere. Soon hewasneglectinghisown business, thinking only ofthecup and thefortune itcould bring. Finallyhewent toEdo to talk toFushimiyaathisshop. There thedealer, realizing that hehad inad~ vertently caused this man pain bymaking him believe thecuphad great worth, paid him 100ryo(gold pieces) forthecupasakindness. Thecup wasindeed mediocre, but hewanted toridtheartisan ofhisobsession, while alsoallowing him tofeel that hiseffort had notbeen wasted. The ar- tisan thanked him and went onhisway. Soon word spread ofFushimiya’s purchaseoftheteacup. Everydealer injapanclamored forhim tosellit,since acuphehadboughtfor 100ryo must beworth much more. Hetried toexplainthecircumstances inwhich hehadbought thecup, butthedealers could notbedissuaded. Fushimiya finally relented andputthecup upforsale. Duringtheauction, twobuyers simultaneouslybid 200ryo forthe teacup,and then begantofightover who had bid first.
