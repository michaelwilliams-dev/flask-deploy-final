such an obvious inference.] 1. If the enemy�s troops march up angrily and remain facing ours for a long time without either joining battle or taking themselves off again, the situ- ation is one that demands great vigilance and circumspection. [Ts�ao Kung says a maneuver of this sort may be only a ruse to gain time for an unexpected flank attack or the laying of an ambush.] CHAPTER 10. THE ARMY ON THE MARCH 84 1. If our troops are no more in number than the enemy, that is amply suffi- cient; it only means that no direct attack can be made. [Literally, "no martial advance." That is to say, CHENG tactics and frontal attacks must be eschewed, and stratagem resorted to instead.] What we can do is simply to concentrate all our available strength, keep a close watch on the enemy, and obtain reinforcements. [This is an obscure sentence, and none of the commentators succeed in squeezing very good sense out of it. I follow Li Ch�uan, who appears to of- fer the simplest explanation: "Only the side that gets more men will win." Fortunately we have Chang Yu to expound its meaning to us in language which is lucidity itself: "When the numbers are even, and no favorable opening presents itself, although we may not be strong enough to deliver a sustained attack, we can find additional recruits amongst our sutlers and camp-followers, and then, concentrating our forces and keeping a close watch on the enemy, contrive to snatch the victory. But we must avoid borrowing foreign soldiers to help us." He then quotes from Wei Liao Tzu, ch. 3: "The nominal strength of mercenary troops may be 100,000, but their real value will be not more than half that figure."] 1. He who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is sure to be captured by them. [Ch�en Hao, quoting from the TSO CHUAN, says: "If bees and scorpions carry poison, how much more will a hostile state! Even a puny opponent, then, should not be treated with contempt."] 1. If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you, they will not prove submissive; and, unless submissive, then will be practically use- less. If, when the soldiers have become attached to you, punishments are not enforced, they will still be unless. 2. Therefore soldiers must be treated in the first instance with humanity, but kept under control by means of iron discipline. [Yen Tzu [B.C. 493] said of Ssu-ma Jang-chu: "His civil virtues endeared him to the people; his martial prowess kept his enemies in awe." Cf. Wu Tzu, ch. 4 init.: "The ideal commander unites culture with a warlike tem- per; the profession of arms requires a combination of hardness and tender- ness."] This is a certain road to victory. 1. If in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced, the army will be well-disciplined; if not, its discipline will be bad. 2. If a general shows confidence in his men but always
