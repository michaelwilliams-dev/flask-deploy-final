[ 1 ] Strategic Assessments Master Sun Military action is important to the nation�it is the ground of death and life, the path of survival and destruction, so it is imperative to examine it. LI QUAN Military action is inauspicious�it is only considered important because it is a matter of life and death, and there is the possibility that it may be taken up lightly. DU MU The survival or destruction of a country and the life or death of its people may depend on military action, so it is necessary to examine it carefully.

WANG XI Assess the leadership, the environmental conditions, discipline, troops, officers, and the system of rewards and punishments. ZHANG YU Master Guan said that assessments should be made at home before sending troops abroad. Assessments are the first order of business in military operations. Some say that military operations should be adjusted right on the spot, in confrontation with the opponent, but General Cao Cao says that assessments should be made at headquarters�this is because it is imperative first to assess the wisdom of the leaders, the strength of the opponent, the lay of the land, and the number of troops; then when the two armies confront one another, the adaptations to be made are determined by the leadership in a manner consistent with these calculations.
