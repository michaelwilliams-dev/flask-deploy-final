how they rule orlive .Only ec- clesiastical Princes have states ,which they do not defend ,sub- jects that they donot govern .Because they don't defend them ,no one takes them away .The subjects ,since they are not governed , don't care about ,think about ,nor alienate themselves from their Princes .Therefore ,only these Principalities are really secure and happy . Sustained by higher powers ,which the human mind cannot understand ,there isnouse talking about them .Being held upby God ,itwould bepresumptuous ofman todiscourse onthem .Yet ifsomeone asked where the Church got itsgreat temporal power , Iwould have tosay that since Pope Alexander VI (1492 )the Ital- ian potentates ,and not only those who ranked themselves aspo- tentates ,but every baron and lord ,even lesser ones ,underesti- mated the Church's temporal power and now the King ofFrance himself trembles .Alexander has taken over Italy ,and ruined the Venetians .Since this isthe case ,maybe we should bring these events tomind . Before King Charles ofFrance invaded Italy in1494 ,this province was ruled by the Pope ,by Venetians ,by the King of Naples ,bythe Duke ofMilan and bythe Florentines .These po- tentates care about two things :one ,that no foreigner enter Italy with arms ;two ,that nopotentate expand his state .The most trou- blesome were the Pope and the Venetians .To keep after the Ve- 72- Niccol√≤ Machiavelli netians ,the others had tohold together ,asinthe defense of Ferrara (1482-1484 ).To hold the Pope back ,the others played on the Barons ofRome .The Barons ofRome were divided into two factions ,the Orsini and the Colonna ,with scandals going onbe- tween the two .Armed and under the eyes ofthe Popes ,they kept the papacy weak .Although sometimes astrong Pope like Sistus IV (1471-1484 )emerged ,neither fortune nor savvy could get around the Barons .The shortness ofPopes 'lives was the real reason aPope ruled on average ten years .Inthis short time ,it was impossible toknock one ofthe factions out .Ifone almost did the Colonnas in,another enemy ofthe Orsini would turn up,re- viving the Colonnas ,and the Orsini themselves never gave way . This fact led tothe underestimation ofthe Pope's power inIt- aly.Then ,Alexander VI was coronated (1492-1503 )who ofall the Popes showed how much aPope with both money and the use offorce could prevail .Using Duke Valentine and capitalizing on the failure ofthe French ,hedid allthose things Imention above inthe history ofthe Duke .Although his intention was not toag- grandize the Church ,the Duke despite his actions did just that . The Church ,after the Duke's death ,reaped the benefits .Then came Pope Julius II(1503-1513 )who found the Church great in state ,owning all ofRomagna and with the Barons weakened the factions having been wiped out by Alexander .He found the way open as never before to make money (by selling indul- gences ). Julius not only followed but also increased these practices , hoping togain Bologna ,finish off the Venetians ,and chase the French out ofItaly .He succeeded inall these ,tohis own re- known ,working
