was made captain of the armies by the Thebans and, after their victory, took their liberty from them. The people of Milan, after Duke Philip's death, made Francesco Sforza their captain against the Venetians. After defeating the Venetians at Caravag.gio, joined with them to put down his patrons in Milan and he take over. His father, a soldier Queen Gio of Naples, aban. for doned her unarmed, whereupon she had to throw herself on the mercy of the King of Aragon. True, the Venetians and Florentines expanded their territory with mercenary arms, and their captains did not become Princes, but defended them � but, in these cases, they were favored by fate. Some valorous captains, whom they might fear, did not win, THE PRINCE � 77 others had opposition, and still others directed their ambitions elsewhere. Giovanni Acuto (John Hawkwood, 1320-1394) was not a winner � so he was never tested. But everyone said that if he had won he could have had Florence. Sforza in Milan always had Andrea Fortebracci (1368-1424) against him, holding back each other. Francesco Sforza cast his lot with Lombardy, while Braccio went against the Church and the Kingdom of Naples. Let's look at what happened recently. Florence made Paul Vitelli captain, a most prudent man who made a big reputation out of a private fortune. If he had succeeded in Pisa, he could have done the same in Florence. If he had become their soldier, soldier of the enemy, Florence would have had to obey him too. Look at Venice and their success. At first, they advanced their interests surely and gloriously with their own tactics until they campaigned on the ground. At sea they succeeded with their own leaders and people, but when they launched a ground campaign they adopted the Italian use of mercenaries. At first, as a great city with little territory, they�d didn't have much to fear from their captains. But in the second war with Milan under Francesco Bur.rone, Count of Carmagnola, they learned the error of their ways. Lauding him as virtuous because at first he had defeated the Duke of Milan, but knowing how he had turned, they saw they could not win with Count of Pitigliano and others who all risked losing, as happened at Vaila (1509) when Venice lost in one day gains of eight hundred years. Such arms make gains slowly, late, and fee.bly, and they are soon lost. There are examples from Italy, gov.erned for a long time by mercenary troops, and I discuss them at length to define the origins and progress of their cases so that things can be improved. It is to be understood, then, how in recent times with the de.cline of imperial power in Italy and the increase in the temporal of the power papacy, Italy divided into many states. Many great cities took arms against the nobles who were formerly favored by the Emperor. The church favored the cities because it increased their own temporal power. Many
