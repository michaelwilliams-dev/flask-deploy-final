I will make some generalities. Never has a new Prince disarmed his subjects. Often, Instead, he has armed them. By arming them he appropriates their force � they are on his side. Those who you arm become your faithful armed subjects and overcome your partisans since you can�t arm to do them all you subject those you don't arm those you arm. to The discrimination obliges those that you favor support you. The others excuse you because they respect those who take the risk and the duty. You offend those whom you disarm. They feel a loss your faith them either from cowardice distrust. of in or Suspicion of either increases their hatred. Because you must be armed you have to turn to mercenaries, which are untrustworthy, as I said above. Even if they are reliable, they are not strong enough to defend you against strong enemies or suspect subjects. Therefore, as I said, a new Prince always sets up an army. His.tory supplies many examples. When a Prince adds a new member to his old state, however, he should disarm the new state, unless they were allies before be.ing incorporated. Even these with time and opportunity should be neutralized. The arms should be restricted to one's own soldiers in that part of the old state that is close to you. 110 � Niccol� Machiavelli Our forefathers, and those reputed to be wise, held that Pis.tola be partitioned and Pisa occupied by force. To facilitate this, in to they sowed division there order move more easily against them. In times of a balance of power, this was fairly easy. But I don�t think it is suitable today. I don't think these divisions help anyone now � it always happens in a divided city that the weaker faction joins the enemy, the other can't hold, and the city goes down to defeat. The Venetians, following these old guidelines, encouraged the Guelfs and Ghibellines in their occupied cities. Although they avoided bloodbaths, they kept the factions at each other so that citizens would be preoccupied by their differences with each not other and not united against the Venetians. This did work. Defeated at Vailate (1509), the Venetians were assailed by one of of the factions and stripped their state. Such methods seem to weaken the Prince. In a proud Principality, such divisions are not permitted. They are useful during peace, but useless during war. Without a doubt Princes wax great when they overcome the obstacles in their path; a new Prince needs fortune and making a to to reputation is more important him than a hereditary Prince. Enemies make reputations for the Prince and the feats against them, which he overcomes. A Prince mounts by the ladder his enemies use against him. A sage Prince, some say, astutely culti.vates enemies when he can so that, when he puts them down, his reputation increases. Sometimes a Prince and especially new ones have profited more from using those men who are suspect than using
