ASSUME FORMLESSNESS. Wisdom in a nutshell: Accept the fact that nothing is certain and no law is fixed. Be as fluid and formless as water, adapting and moving with change naturally.

Play the chameleon but break your enemy from the inside. Morph and adapt but keep your long-term strategy in mind at all times.
