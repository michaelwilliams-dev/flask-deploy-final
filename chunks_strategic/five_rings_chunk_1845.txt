itover.For itislikely that ifacityofgoodmen came tobe,therewould beafightovernotruling, justasthere isnow over ruling; andthere itwould become manifest that atrueruler really doesnotnaturally consider hisownadvantage butrather thatoftheone who isruled. Thus everyone whoknows would choose tobebenefited byanother rather than totakethetrouble ofbenefiting another. SoI caninnowayagree withThrasymachus thatthejust istheadvantage ofthestronger. Butthisweshall consider again atanother time.What Thrasymachus now says isinmyownopinion afarbigger thingâ€” he asserts thatthe lifeoftheunjustman isstronger^^ than thatofthejust man.Which doyouchoose, Glaucon," Isaid,"andwhich speech is truer inyour opinion?" "Iformypartchoose the lifeofthejustman asmore profitable." "Did youhear," Isaid,"howmany good things Thrasymachus listed amoment agoasbelonging tothe lifeoftheunjust man?" 348 "Iheard," hesaid, "but I'mnotpersuaded." "Then doyouwant ustopersuade him, ifwe're able tofindaway, thatwhathesays isn'ttrue?" "How could Inotwant it?"hesaid. "Now," Isaid, "ifweshould speak atlength against him, setting speech against speech, telling howmany good things belong tobeing just,andthenheshould speak inreturn, andweagain, there'll beneed [25 ] socrates/glaucon/thrasymachus therepublic 34abofcounting thegood things andmeasuring howmany eachofushasin each speech, andthen we'llbeinneed ofsome sortofjudges^^ who willdecide. But ifweconsider justaswedidamoment ago,coming to agreement withoneanother, we'll ourselves beboth judges and pleaders atonce." "Most certainly," hesaid. "Which waydoyoulike?" Isaid. "The latter," hesaid. "Come now, Thrasymachus," Isaid,"answer usfrom thebegin- ning.Doyouassert thatperfect injustice ismore profitable than justice when itisperfect?" c"1most certainly doassert it,"hesaid,"and I'vesaidwhy." "Well, then,howdoyouspeak about them inthisrespect? Surely you calloneofthem virtue andtheother vice?" "Ofcourse." "Then doyou calljustice virtue and injustice vice?" "That's likely, youagreeable man," hesaid,"when Ialsosaythat injustice isprofitable andjustice isn't." "What then?" "The opposite," hesaid. "Isjustice then vice?" "No,butveryhigh-minded innocence." d "Doyou callinjustice corruption?"44 "No, rather good counsel." "Are theunjust inyour opinion good aswell asprudent, Thra- symachus?" "Yes, thosewhocandoinjustice perfectly," hesaid,"and areable tosubjugate cities andtribes ofmen tothemselves. You,perhaps, sup- pose Iamspeaking ofcutpurses. Now, such things, too,areprofitable," hesaid,"when onegetsaway withthem; butthey aren't worth men- tioning compared tothose Iwasjusttalking about." e "Astothat," Isaid, "I'mnotunaware ofwhatyouwant tosay. But Iwondered about whatwent before, thatyouputinjustice inthe camp ofvirtue andwisdom, andjustice among their opposites?" "But Idoindeed setthem do\vn assuch." "That's already something more solid,mycomrade," Isaid,"and it'snolonger easy toknowwhatoneshould say.For ifyouhad setin- justice-down asprofitable buthad nevertheless agreed that itis viciousness orshameful, asdosome others, wewould havesomething tosay,speaking according tocustomary usage. But asitis,plainly you'll saythat injustice isfairandmighty, and, sinceyoualsodared to set itdown inthecamp ofvirtue andwisdom, you'll setdown toitsac- [26] Book 11348b-349d socrates/thrasymachus count alltheother things whichweused tosetdown asbelonging tothe 349a just." "Your divination isvery true," hesaid. "But nonetheless," Isaid, "one oughtn't tohesitate topursue the consideration oftheargument aslong asIunderstand youtosaywhat youthink. For,Thrasymachus, youseem really nottobejoking now, buttobespeaking thetruth asitseems toyou." "And what difference does itmake toyou," hesaid,"whether it seems sotomeornot,andwhy don'tyourefute theargument?" "No difference," Isaid."But trytoanswer this inaddition tothe b other things: inyouropinion would thejustmanbewilling togetthebetter ofthejustman inanything?" "Not atall,"hesaid."Otherwise hewouldn't betheurbane inno- centheactually is." "Andwhatabout this:would hebewilling togetthebetter ofthejust action?" "Noteven oftheJustaction,"hesaid. "And doesheclaim hedeserves togetthebetter oftheunjust man,andbelieve ittobejust, orwould henotbelieve ittobeso?" "He'd believe ittobejust," hesaid,"and he'd claim hedeserves togetthebetter, buthewouldn't beable to." "That," Isaid, "isnotwhat Iamasking, butwhether thejustman wants, andclaims hedeserves, togetthebetter oftheunjust andnotof c thejustman?" "Hedoes," hesaid. "And what about theunjust man? Does heclaim hedeserves to getthebetter ofthejustmanandthejustaction?" "How could itbeotherwise, "he said, "since heclaims he deserves togetthebetter ofeveryone?" "Then willtheunjust man alsogetthebetter oftheunjust hu- manbeing and action, and
