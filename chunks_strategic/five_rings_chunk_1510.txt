Second, many believe thatby beinghonest andopen theyarewinning people's hearts andshowing their good nature.Theyaregreatlydeluded. Honestyisactuallyablunt instru- ment, which bloodies more than itcuts. Your honestyislikelytooffend people;itismuch more prudenttotailor your words, telling peoplewhat theywant tohear rather than the coarse andugly truth ofwhatyoufeel or think.

Yetheknew thatifbe destroyed it,theFrench would realize what hewanted-to advance down that road. Instead, then, hemerely captured thefort, andgarrisoned itwith some ofhistroops, making itappearasifhewanted itforsome purposeof his own. The French attacked thefort and theduke letthemrecaptureit.
