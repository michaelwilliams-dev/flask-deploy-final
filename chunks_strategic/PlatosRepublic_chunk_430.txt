in the Meno. It is a great shock to discover that the diagonal of a square is not commensurable with its sides; only an irrational number can express the rela? tionship. This raises far-reaching questions about the relation of physical and geometrical reality to mathematical rationality. Such lines are irrational, not able to give an account of themselves in the terms of whole numbers. This is the discovery of the Pythagorean theorem. 27. The word is synopsis, "a seeing together." 28. There is a pun on "steadfast" (monimos) and "established by law" (nomimos}. The phrase is an alliterative jingle. 21. Cf. 390a, note 31. 22. Flattery probably means an appeal to the pleasant as opposed to the good (cf. Gorgias, 463b). 23. The word for "demon" is daim6h and that for "happy" is eu? daimon, "possessing a good demon." Book VIII 1. For "dynasty," cf. 499c, note 24. It is not certain what is meant by "purchased kingships," butï¿½cf. Aristotle, Politics, 1273a. 2. Odyssey,. XIX, 163; Iliad, XXII, 126; Hesiod, Theogony, 35; Apology, 34d. 1. The word time means "honor." 2. This is an adaptation of Iliad, XVI, 112. 3. The nuptial number is one of the darkest passages in Plato's works. It presents difficulties both because we do not know Greek mathematics suffi? ciently well and because of the "high tragic" manner of its presentation. Its in? terpretation has been a subject of dispute since antiquity. For a list of some of the commentaries on it cf. Plato's Republic, James Adam, ed. (Cambridge, 1963), Vol. I, pp. xlviii-1. The number clearly has much to do with the Pythagorean triangle whose sides were 3, 4, 5, and which reflects one of the greatest discoveries and prob? lems of ancient science (cf. Aristotle, Politics, 1316a; and 534d, note 26). The surface reason for the number's appearance here is to relate the cos? mic principles of science to this perfect regime, to establish a harmony be? tween the knowledge of nature and of politics. In this way the highest human things would not be merely the playthings of chance, and there could be per? fect technical control over the conditions of decent political life. The riddle? some character of the number's presentation may well reflect on the reality of that harmony and hence on the naturalness and possibility of this regime, which is supposed to be both possible and according to nature. This regime was predicated on the emergence of rulers who are knowers or artisans in the precise sense first insisted on by Thrasymachus and later adopted by Socrates. Their highest function was to insure the reproduction of the species, the replenishment of their own numbers. If human reproduction cannot be controlled, if there is no science of eugenics combined with the power to use it well, chance rules human affairs, and regimes must lower their stand? ards and rely on more ordinary rulers. The best regime is the regime of artisans who are able to live according to nature because
