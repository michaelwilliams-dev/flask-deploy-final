ofAristotle's rulers tothecity isnotquite pure, andtheregime hasto accept theinjustice ofmaking wealth oneofthe titles torule. Virtue [370 ] Interpretive Essay without wealth hasnoplace inAristotle's bestregime; convention must bemixed with nature. Socrates isattempting tosatisfy Glaucon's re- quest; heistrying toshow that political justice isgood initself, notbe- cause itcanbeasource ofother advantages. Perhaps thatrequest can- notbesatisfied, atleastonthelevel ofGlaucon's original intention. However, strictly political considerations arenotsufficient toac- count forSocrates' procedure; itcanbeexplained ultimately only in thelight ofthetrans-political considerations which emerge later.On political grounds itwould bewise tomake thecompromises necessary tomake theguardians happy. Buttheconcentration onthepublic and thecommon, theforgetfulness ofthedemands ofthebody, prepares the way fortheintroduction ofphilosophy which isthemost universal con- cern. Itistheconcern withtheprivate orparticular assuch thatmust beovercome ifindividuals aretophilosophize andcities aretoberuled byphilosophy. Theguardian who istotally devoted tothecommon good istheprototype ofthephilosopher who isdevoted toknowing the good. Adeimantus isasecret lover ofwealth, asisrevealed byhis rebellion attheabolition ofprivate property. Therefore Socrates imme- diately turns toanattack ontheeffects ofwealth onthecity.Thispro- vokes Adeimantus intomaking alaststand initsfavor.Heobjects that thecitywillnotberichenough todefend itself.Wars require money, and sosome amount ofacquisitiveness must bepermitted. Perhaps sound domestic policy would discourage theacquisition ofwealth, butpriority mustbegiven toforeign policy since the city's very ex- istence depends on it.Adeimantus' objection, then, isthesame as Machiavelli's: thebestregime isamere dream, foragood citycannot avoid ruin ifitdoes notdothethings which willenable ittosurvive among vicious cities. Itisforeign policy which makes thedevotion to thegood lifewithin acityimpossible. Onemustbeatleast aspowerful asone's neighbors andmust adopt awayoflifesuch astomake this possible. Poverty, smallness, andunchangingness cannot compete with wealth, greatness, andinnovation. Thetruepolicy isoutward-looking, and cities andmen areradically dependent onothers forwhat they must be.Without aresponse tothisobjection— which Machiavelli thought tobedecisive fortherejection ofclassical political thought— theveryattempt toelaborate autopia isfolly. Inhisattempt tomeet theobjection, Socrates formulates a Machiavellian foreign policy inorder topreserve theanti-Machi- avellian domestic policy ofhis city.The city willbetoopoor to bevery attractive asanobject ofconquest; itstough fighters willmake itadangerous enemy and itwilljoin itspotential attacker inattacking [371 ] THEREPUBLIC soft, rich cities. Furthermore, inorder toprevent thealHed cityfrom becoming all-powerful, itwillfoment civil discord within it,siding with thepoor, although theguardians' citydoesnotbelieve thepoor have justice ontheir side.Inthiswaythecitycanliveasthough ithad noneighbors anddevote itself towhatever wayoflife itdeems best. In relation toitsneighbors, thecity isnotmotivated byconsiderations of justice butbythose ofpreservation. Justice hastodowiththedomestic lifeofthecityandcannot beextended beyond itsborders. This isa point tobeconsidered when examining theanalogy between cityand man: justice issupposed tobethesame inboth, soonewould expect thatamanshould behave toward othermen asdoes acitytoward other cities. Socrates' argument persuades atleastAdeimantus, andtherewith hislastreserves about theregime havebeenovercome. Hebecomes Soc- rates' whole-hearted ally.Henow uses hismoralizing severity against allenemies oftheregime, particularly against poets andordinary statesmen. Anything thatmight weaken hisnewly founded city ishis enemy, andheisangry withthosewhom heregards asvicious. Hiscon- ductcanbeexplained byreference toanobservation hehimself made inhislongspeech onjustice. There heasserted thatamanwho truly knows thatjustice isbetter than injustice isnotangry with thosewho doinjustice; rather, hesympathizes with their ignorance, knowing that theyarenotresponsible. Theimplication isthatthosewhoareangry at injustice donotknow itsinferiority, that their anger isawayofsup- pressing theirowntemptations, thattheyblame others forgiving way totemptations thatbeset themselves. After thecurious fashion ofmoral indignation, they attribute responsibility where there isnone. Forthose whowant tobejustbuthold theobjects ofinjustice tobegood, self- restraint isnecessary; anger andblame arethemeans ofthat restraint. Inthese passages thecontrast between Socrates' gentleness andAdei- mantus' indignation isstriking, suggesting thatthey represent the al- ternatives ofknowledge andignorance ofthesuperiority ofjustice. It almost seems asthough
