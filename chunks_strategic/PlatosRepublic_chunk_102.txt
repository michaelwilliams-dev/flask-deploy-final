he sits in the middle of the earth at its navel and delivers his interpretations." "What you say is fine," he said. "And that's what must be done." "So then, son of Ariston," I said, "your city would now be founded. In the next place, get yourself an adequate light somewhere; and look yourself-and call in your brother and Polemarchus and the others-whether we can somehow see where the justice might be and where the injustice, in what they differ from one another, and which the man who's going to be happy must possess, whether it escapes the notice of all gods and humans or not." "You're talking nonsense," said Glaucon. "You promised you would look for it because it's not holy for you not to bring help to justice in every way in your power." "What you remind me of is true," I said, "and though I must do so, you too have to join in." "We'll do so," he said. "Now, then," I said, "I hope I'll find it in this way. I suppose our city-if, that is, it has been correctly founded-is perfectly good." "Necessarily," he said. "Plainly, then, it's wise, courageous, moderate and just." "Plainly." "Isn't it the case that whichever of them we happen to find will leave as the remainder what hasn't been found?" "Of course." "Therefore, just as with any other four things, if we were seeking any one of them in something or other and recognized it first, that would be enough for us; but if we recognized the other three first, this would also suffice for the recognition of the thing looked for.

"What you say is correct," he said. 427b C d e 428 a 428a b "With these things too, since they happen to be four, mustn't we look for them in the same way?" "Plainly." "Well, it's wisdom, in my opinion, which first comes plainly to light in it. And something about it looks strange." "What?" he said. "The city we described is really wise, in my opinion. That's be? cause it's of good counsel,12 isn't it?" "Yes.ï¿½ "And further, this very thing, good counsel, is plainly a kind of knowledge. For it's surely not by lack of learning, but by knowledge, that men counsel well." "Plainly." "But, on the other hand, there's much knowledge of all sorts in the city." "Of course." "Then, is it thanks to the carpenters' knowledge that the city must be called wise and of good counsel?" "Not at all," he said, "thanks to that ifs called skilled in carpen- b. try." "Then, it's not thanks to the knowledge that counsels about how wooden implements would be best that a city must be called wise." "Surely not." "And what about this? Is it thanks to the knowledge of bronze implements or any other knowledge of such things?" "Not to any knowledge of the sort," he said. "And not to the knowledge about the
