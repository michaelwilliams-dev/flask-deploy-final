say that I understand that these things are so d and not as you set them down at first. But whether the just also live bet- ter than the unjust and are happier, which is what we afterwards pro- posed for consideration, must be considered. And now, in my opinion, they do also look as though they are, on the basis of what we have said. Nevertheless, this must still be considered better: for the argument is not about just any question, but about the way one should live." "Well, go ahead and consider," he said. 352d e 353a "I shail," I said. "Tell me, in your opinion is there some work that belongs to a horse?" "Yes.,, "Would you take the work of a horse or of anything else what? soever to be that which one can do only with it, ï¿½or best with it?" "I don't understand," he said. "Look at it this way: is there anything with which you could see other than eyes?'' "Surely not." "And what about this? Could you hear with anything other than ears?" "By no means." "Then wouldn't we justly assert that this is the work of each?" "Certainly." "And what about this: you could cut a slip from a vine with a dag? ger or a leather-cutter or many other things?" ''Of course." "But I suppose you could not do as fine a job with anything other than a pruning knife made for this purpose." "True.,, "Then shall we take this to be its work?" "We shall indeed." "Now I suppose you can understand better what I was asking a moment ago when I wanted to know whether the work of each thing is what it alone can do, or can do more finely than other things." "Yes, I do understand," he said, "and this is, in my opinion, the b work of each thing." "All right," I said, "does there seem to you also to be a virtue for each thing to which some work is assigned? Let's return again to the same examples. We say that eyes have some work?" "They do." "Is there then a virtue of eyes, too?" "A virtue, too." "And what about ears? Wasn't it agreed that they have some work?" "Yes.,, "And do they have a virtue, too?'' "Yes, -they do." "And what about all other things? Aren't they the same?" "They are." "Stop for a moment. Could eyes ever do a fine job of their work if they did not have their proper virtue but, instead of the virtue, vice?" "How could they?" he said. "For you probably mean blindness instead of sight." "Whatever their virtue may be," I said. "For rm not yet asking that, but whether their work, the things to be done by them, will be done well with their proper virtue, and badly with vice." "What you say is true," he said. "Will ears, too, do their work badly when deprived of their vir- tue?" "Certainly." "Then, shall we
