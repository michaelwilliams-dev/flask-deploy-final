"Well," hesaid, "that's theway itlooked best forthosewho un- dergo itandforthecity." "Then your young," Isaid, "will plainly beware offalling into need ofthejudge's art,since theyusethatsimple music whichweclaimed engenders moderation." [88] Book III/409a-411a socrates/glaucon "Ofcourse," hesaid. 410a "Won't themusical manhunt foragymnastic byfollowing these b same tracks, and, ifhewishes, catch it,sothathewillrequire noartof medicine except incaseofnecessity?" "That's myopinion." "Moreover, he'llundergo these very exercises andlabors looking lesstostrength than tothespirited partofhisnature andforthepurpose ofarousing it,unlike theother kinds ofcontestants who treat dietsand labors asmeans toforce." "Quite right," hesaid. "Then, Glaucon," Isaid, "did thosewho established aneducation inmusic andgymnastic dosoforother reasons than theonesupposed c bysome, thatthelatter should care forthebodyandtheformer forthe soul?" "Forwhat else,then?" hesaid. "It's likely," Isaid, "that they established both chiefly forthe soul." "How's that?" "Don't younotice," Isaid, "theturnofmind ofthosewhomain- tain alifelong familiarity with gymnastic butdon't touch music; or, again, thatofthosewhodotheopposite?" "What areyoutalking about?" hesaid. "Savageness andhardness ontheonehand," Isaid, "softness and c tameness ontheother." "Idonotice," hesaid, "that thosewhomake useofunmixed gym- nastic turnoutmore savage thantheyought, while thosewhomake use ofmusic become intheir turn softer than isfine forthem." "And, surely," Isaid, "thesavage stems from thespirited partof their nature, which, ifrightly trained, would becourageous; but, if raised toahigher pitch than itought tohave, would belikely tobe- come cruel andharsh." "That ismyopinion," hesaid. "Andwhat about this?Wouldn't thephilosophic nature have the tame; and ifitisrelaxed somewhat more, would itbesofter than it ought tobe,while ifitisfinely reared, itwould betameandorderly?" "That's so." "Andwedosaythattheguardians musthaveboth ofthesetwo natures." "Yes, theymust." "Then mustn't theybeharmonized withoneanother?" "Ofcourse." "And thesoul oftheman thusharmonized ismoderate and courageous?" ^-^^ [89 ] GLAUCON/sOCaftATES THEREPUBLIC 411a "Certainly." "And thatoftheinharmonious man iscowardly andcrude?" "Ofcourse." "Then, when aman gives himself tomusic and letstheflute play andpour intohissoulthrough hisears, asitwere intoafunnel— using those sweet, soft,wailing harmonies wewere justspeaking of—and spends hiswhole lifehumming andexulting insong, atfirst,whatever spiritedness hehad,hesoftened likeironandmade useful fromhaving b been useless andhard. Butwhen hekeeps atitwithout letting upand charms hisspirit, he,asthenext step, already begins tomeltand li- quefy hisspirit, untilhedissolves itcompletely andcuts out,asitwere, thesinews from hissoulandmakes it'afeeble warrior.'"^^ "Most certainly," hesaid. "And," Isaid, "iffrom the starthegotaspiritless soulfrom nature, heaccomplishes thisquickly. But ifit'sspirited, thespirit is weakened andmade temperamental, quickly inflamed bylittle things and quickly extinguished. Thus thesemen have become quick- c tempered and irritable fromhaving been spirited, andthey arefilled with discontent." "Quite so." "Now what about themanwho labors agreat deal atgymnastic andfeasts himself really wellbutnever touches music andphilosophy? At first, with hisbody ingood condition, isn'thefilled with high thought and spirit, anddoesn't hebecome braver than himself?" "Very much." "Butwhat aboutwhen hedoesnothing elseandnevercommunes d with aMuse? Even iftherewassome loveoflearning inhissoul, be- cause itnever tastes ofanykind oflearning orinvestigation norpar- takes inspeech ortherestofmusic, doesn't itbecome weak, deaf,and blind because itisn'tawakened ortrained and itsperceptions aren't purified?" "That's so,"hesaid. "Then, Isuppose, such amanbecomes amisologist^^ andun- musical.
