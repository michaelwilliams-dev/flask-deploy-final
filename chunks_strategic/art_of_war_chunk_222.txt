Without detachment, there is no way to clarify the will; without serenity, there is no way to get far. Study requires calm, talent requires study. Without study there is no way to expand talent; without calm there is no way to accomplish study. If you are lazy, you cannot do thorough research; if you are impulsive, you cannot govern your nature. The years run off with the hours, aspirations flee with the years.
