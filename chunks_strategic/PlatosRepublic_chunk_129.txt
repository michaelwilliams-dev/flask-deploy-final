with the human spe? cies." "Of course it is," he said, "but why does that affect the rulers?" , "Because it will be a necessity for them to use many drugs," I said. "Presumably we believe that for bodies not needing drugs, but willing to respond to a prescribed course of life, even a common doctor will do. But, of course, when there is also a need to use drugs, we know there is need of the most courageous doctor." "True, but to what purpose do you say this?" "To this," I said. "It's likely that our rulers will have to use a throng of lies and deceptions for the benefit of the ruled. And, of� course, we said that everything of this sort is useful as a form of remedy." "And we were right," he said. "Now, it seems it is not the least in marriages and procreations, that this 'right' comes into being." "How so?" "On the basis of what has been agreed," I said, "there is a need for the best men to have intercourse as often as possible with the best women, and the reverse for the most ordinary men with the most ordi? nary women; and the offspring of the former must be reared but not that of the others, if the flock is going to be of the most eminent quality. And.�. all this must come to pass without being noticed by anyone except the �; rulers themselves if the guardians' herd is to be as free as possible from ' faction." "Quite right," he said. [ 138 1 "So then, certain festivals and sacrifices must be established by law at which we'll bring the brides and grooms together, and our poets must make hymns suitable to the marriages that take place. The mun ber of the marriages we'll leave to the rulers in order that they may most nearly preserve the same number of men, taking into considera? tion wars, diseases, and everything else of the sort; and thus our city will, within the limits of the possible, become neither big nor little." "Right," he said. "I suppose certain subtle lots must be fabricated so that the ordi? nary man will blame chance rather than the rulers for each union." "Quite so," he said. "And, presumably, along with other prizes and rewards, �the privilege of more abundant intercourse with the women must be given to those of the young who are good in war or elsewhere, so that under this pretext the most children will also be sown by such men." "Right." "And as the offspring are born, won't they be taken over by the officers established for this purpose-men or women, or both, for pre? sumably the offices are common to women and men-and ... " "Yes.n 459e 460a b "So, I think, they will take the offspring of the good and bring c them into the pen19 to certain nurses who live apart in a certain sec- tion of the city.
