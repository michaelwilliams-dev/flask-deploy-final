wishes Sages and philosophers are deterred. The Great Process makes myriad beings Of countless different types. Fragrant and foul are not put together The humane and the violent apply different norms. If you put them together How can they get along? Lament of a Soldier�s Wife You�re better off grass by the roadside Than wife to a soldier at war. The wedding bed not even warm Her man�s now on the northern front. She remembers the day they parted How the snow flew o�er the landscape Bow and arrows heavy at his side Ice splitting his horse�s hooves He is so far from home How can they hope to meet?

But there is a rule in the army To be careful all of the time They cannot think of home and family But work mindlessly for defense Since ancient times men loyal to duty All have learned to die. The Art of War and the I Ching: Strategy and Change The Art of War and the I Ching are two perennial Chinese classics, ancient books that have been studied by civil and military strategists throughout the ages in China and neighboring Asian countries.

The following studies of The Art of War survey both ideas and events in the philosophy and application of conflict management according to this tradition. The connection between the philosophy and organizational science of The Art of War and the even more ancient I Ching is cited in the introduction to my translation of The Art of War. In order to put this classic of strategy in its philosophical perspective, it is logical to begin with the teachings on contention and military action outlined in the I Ching itself. To many readers both East and West, the I Ching may be familiar as an ancient book of omens, used for millennia as a fortune-telling handbook. It is still undoubtedly used for prognostication, but this practice has not been endorsed by leading philosophers or political scientists. Divination has been explicitly prohibited by military scientists at least as far back in history as The Art of War itself. For the social
