what way do these men live?" I said. "And what is the charac? ter of such a regime? For it's plain that the man who is like it will turn out to be democratic." "Yes, it is plain," he said. "In the first place, then, aren't they free? And isn't the city full of freedom and free speech? And isn't there license in it to do whatever . one wants?" "That is what is said, certainly," he said. "And where there's license, it's plain that each man ï¿½would organize his life in it privately just as it pleases him." "Yes, it is plain." "Then I suppose that in this regime especially, all sorts of human beings._cQm'e to be." "How could they fail to?" "It is probably the fairest of the regimes," I said. "Just like a many-colored cloak decorated in all hues, this regime, decorated with all dispositions, would also look fairest, and many perhaps," I said, "like boys and women looking at many-colored things, would judge this to be the fairest regime." "Quite so," he said. "And, what's more, y u blessed man," I said, "it's a convenient place to look for a regime." "Why is that?" "Because, thanks to its license, it contains all species of regimes, and it is probably necessary for the man who wishes to organize a city, as we were just doing, to go to a city under a democracy.

"And the absence of any compulsion to rule in this city," I said "even if you are competent to rule, or again to be ruled if you don' want to be, or to make war when the-others are making war, or to keep peace when the others are keeping it, if you don't desire peace; and, if some law prevents you from ruling or being a judge, the absence of any compulsion keeping you from ruling and being a judge anyhow, if you long to do so-isn't such a way of passing the time divinely sweet for the moment?" "Perhaps," he said, "for the moment." "And what about this? Isn't. the gentleness toward16 some of the condemned exquisite? Or in such a regime haven't you yet seen men who have been sentenced to death or exile, nonetheless staying and carrying on right in the middle of things; and, as though no one cared or saw, stalking the land like a hero?"17 "Yes, many," he said. "And this regime's sympathy and total lack of pettiness in despis- ing what we were saying so solemnly when we were founding the city-that unless a man has a transcendent nature he would never be? come good if from earliest childhood his play isn't noble
