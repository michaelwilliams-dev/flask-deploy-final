The satisfaction is meager comparedtothedanger thatsomedaybeorshewillbeinaposi tion tohurtyou. Transgresskm IV Theyear of1920 had been aparticularly bad oneforAmerican artdealers. Bigbuyers«-«the robber-baron generation oftheprevious century-~were getting toanagewhere theywere dying offlikeflies, and nonew million» aires hademergedtotake their place. Thingswere sobad that anumber of themajordealers decided topooltheir resources, anunheard-of event, since artdealers usually getalong like cats anddogs. Joseph Duveen, artdealer totherichest tycoons ofAmerica, was suf- feringmore than theothers thatyear,sohedecided togoalong with this alliance. The groupnow consisted ofthefivebiggest dealers inthecountry. Looking around for anew client, they decided that their lastbesthopewas Henry Ford, then thewealthiest man inAmerica. Ford hadyettoventure into theartmarket, and hewas such abigtargetthatitmade sense forthem towork together. The dealers decided toassemble alist,“The 100Greatest Paintingsin theWorld” (allofwhich they happenedtohave instock), and tooffer the lotofthem toFord. With onepurchasehecould make himself theworld’s greatest collector. The consortium worked forweeks toproduceamagnifi- centobject:athree-volume setofbooks containing beautiful reproductions ofthepaintings,aswell asscholarlytexts accompanyingeach picture.Next they made apersonalvisit toFord athishome inDearborn, Michigan. There theywere surprised bythesimplicity ofhishouse: Mr.Ford was ob‘ viouslyanextremelyunaffected man. Ford received them inhisstudy. Looking throughthebook, he ex- pressedastonishment anddelight.The excited dealers began imaginingthe millions ofdollars that would shortly flow into their coflers. Finally,how— ever, Ford looked upfrom thebook andsaid, “Gentlemen, beautiful books like these, with beautiful colored pictures like these, must cost anawful lot!” “But Mr.Ford!” exclaimed Duveen, “we don’texpect youtobuythese books. Wegotthemupespeciallyforyou,toshowyouthepictures.These books are apresenttoyou.” Ford seemed puzzled. “Gentlemen,” hesaid, “itisextremelynice ofyou, butIreallydon’t seehow Icanacceptabeau- tiful,expensive present like thisfrom strangers.” Duveen explainedtoFord thatthereproductionsinthebooks showed paintings theyhadhopedto selltohim. Ford finallyunderstood. “But gentlemen,” heexclaimed, “what would Iwant with theoriginal pictures when the ones righthere inthese books are sobeautiful?” Interpretation JosephDuveen pridedhimself onstudying hisvictims and clients inad Vance, figuringouttheir weaknesses and thepeculiaritiesoftheir tastes be foreheever met them. He was driven bydesperationtodropthis tactic just once, inhisassault onHenryFord. Ittook him months torecover from his misjudgrnent,both mentallyand monetarily.Ford was theunassuming plain—ma.n typewhojustisn’t worth thebother. He was theincarnation of those literal-minded folk who donotpossess enough imaginationtobede ceived. From then on,Duveen saved hisenergiesfortheMellons and Mor- gansoftheworld——men crafty enoughforhim toentrapinhis snares.
