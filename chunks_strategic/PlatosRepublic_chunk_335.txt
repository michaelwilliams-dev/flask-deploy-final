making the guardians happy, and Adeimantus asks Soc? rates to make an apology to the charge. He joins Thrasymachus in bring- ingSocrates to trial. Thrasymachus charged Socrates with under? mining the city, with teaching a doctrine which would lead to dis? respect for the law. Adeimantus' charge is not entirely dissimilar. As a founder, Socrates is taking away from the citizens that for which they founded the civil order, their property, their privacy-their own. Soc? rates subordinates happiness to something else, or he robs men of their happiness. His teaching is a threat to that end for which everything is done. Here, as in the earlier accusation, the accuser's selfishness motivates his charge that Socrates is unjust. But there is also no doubt that Socrates is guilty as charged. Socrates' defense is not, as might be expected, that these guard? ians are happy. One could have responded that they get a specific pleasure from doing their duty, that devotion to the city is naturally good for them. Evidently Socrates does not believe that thi1t is the case. Men who engage in politics for the sake of private gain have a suffi? cient motivation for their conduct; but total devotion to the common good does not yet have a sufficient justification in the Republic, and the guardians are asked to serve without adequate compensation. Socrates' response is that he is talking about a happy city and not a happy group within it. Looking at it from the city's point of view, one can see the advantage of its possessing such a group of totally dedicated public serv? ants. But this only postpones discussing the problem of the individ? ual's relation to the city, which has already been postponed by the decision to see justice in a city first, and renders it more acute. Socrates treats the city as though it were an organism, as though there could be a happy city without happy men. With this response, Socrates has not met Adeimantus' objection. It is a powerful objection, one that can be made by wiser men than the youthful, unphilosophic Adeimantus. Aristotle himself agrees that the guardians are not happy and that this speaks against the desirability of the regime. Even Aristotle, whom no one could accuse of encouraging a lax morality, compromises with men's wish to have something of their own, and the rulers in his best regime are property owners. Why then does Socrates insist on makingï¿½ such high demands on his rulers? Perhaps it is because he is more interested in revealing a problem than in making a practical suggestion. By pushing the demand for dedica? tion to the extreme, he brings to light precisely what it is in man that makes such dedication impossible and thereby indicates to practical men what compromises have to be made. Any deviation from this stan? dard of dedication is indeed a compromise; for example, the devotion of Aristotle's rulers to the city is not quite pure, and the regime has to
