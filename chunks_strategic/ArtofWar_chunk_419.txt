civil administration of our officials also require steady application and practice before efficiency is reached. The ancients were particularly chary of allowing mere novices to botch their work.67 Weapons are baneful68 and fighting perilous; and useless unless a general is in constant practice, he ought not to hazard other men�s lives in battle.69 Hence it is essential that Sun Tzu�s 13 chapters should be studied. Hsiang Liang used to instruct his nephew Chi70 in the art of war. Chi got a rough idea of the art in its general bearings, but would not pursue his studies to their proper outcome, the consequence being that he was finally defeated and overthrown. He did not realize that the tricks and artifices of war are beyond verbal computation. Duke Hsiang of Sung and King Yen of Hsu were brought to destruction by their misplaced humanity. The treacherous and underhand nature of war necessitates the use of guile and stratagem suited to the occasion. There is a case on record of Confucius himself having violated an extorted oath,71 and also of his having left the Sung State in disguise.72 Can we then recklessly arraign Sun Tzu for dis- regarding truth and honesty? 66See XIII. ss. 11, note. 67This is a rather obscure allusion to the TSO CHUAN, where Tzu-ch�an says: "If you have a piece of beautiful brocade, you will not employ a mere learner to make it up." 68Cf. TAO TE CHING, ch. 31. 69Sun Hsing-yen might have quoted Confucius again. See LUN YU, XIII. 29, 30. 70Better known as Hsiang Yu [233-202 B.C.]. 71SHIH CHI, ch. 47. 72SHIH CHI, ch. 38. Bibliography 1. WU TZU, in 1 CHUAN or 6 chapters. By Wu Ch�i (d. 381 B.C.). A genuine work. See SHIH CHI, ch. 65. 2. SSU-MA FA, in 1 CHUAN or 5 chapters. Wrongly attributed to Ssu-ma Jang-chu of the 6th century B.C. Its date, however, must be early, as the customs of the three ancient dynasties are constantly to be met within its pages. See SHIH CHI, ch. 64. The SSU K�U CH�UAN SHU (ch. 99, f. 1) remarks that the oldest three treatises on war, SUN TZU, WU TZU and SSU-MA FA, are, generally speaking, only concerned with things strictly military � the art of producing, collecting, training and drilling troops, and the correct theory with regard to measures of expediency, laying plans, transport of goods and the handling of soldiers � in strong contrast to later works, in which the science of war is usually blended with metaphysics, divination and magical arts in general. 3. LIU T�AO, in 6 CHUAN, or 60 chapters. Attributed to Lu Wang (or Lu Shang, also known as T�ai Kung) of the 12th century B.C.73 But its style does not belong to the era of the Three Dynasties. Lu Te-ming (550-625 A.D.) mentions the work, and enumerates the headings of the six sections so that the forgery cannot have been later than Sui dynasty. 4. WEI LIAO TZU, in 5 CHUAN. Attributed to
