it was, after all, fitting for me to hesitate and be afraid to speak and un? dertake to consider so paradoxical an argument." "The more you say such things," he said, "the less we'll let you off from telling how it is possible for this regime to come into being. So speak, and don't waste time." "Then," I said, "first it should be recalled that we got to this point while seeking what justice and injustice are like." "Yes, it should," he said. "But what of it?'' "Nothing. But if we find out what justice is like, will we also insist that the just man must not differ at all from justice itself but in every way be such as it is? Or will we be content ifhe is nearest to it and par? ticipates in it more than the others?'' "We'll be content with that," he said. "It was, therefore, for the sake of a pattern," I said, "that we were seeking both for what justice by itself is like, and for the perfectly just man, if he should come into being, and what he would be like once come into being; and, in their turns, for injustice and the most unjust man. Thus, looking off at what their relationships to happiness and its opposite appear to us to be, we would also be compelled to agree in our own cases that the man who is most like them will have the portion most like theirs. We were not seeking them for the sake of proving that it's possible for these things to come into being." "What you say is true," he said. "Do you suppose a painter is any Jess good who draws a pattern of what the fairest human being would be like and renders everything in the picture adequately, but can't prove that it's also possible that such a man come into being?'' "No, by Zeus, I don't," he said. "Then, what about this? Weren't we, as we assert, also making a pattern in speech of a good city?" GLAUCON/soCRATE "Certainly." � , 472 "Do you suppose that what e. say is any less good on account of our not being able to prove that it is possible to founda city the same as the one in speech?" "Surely not," he said. "Well, then, that's thetruth of it," I said. "But if then to gratify youI must also strive to prove how an? under what condition it would be most possible, grant me the same points again for this proof." "What points?" "Can anything be done as it is said? Or is it the nature of acting 473 to attain to less truth than spe;,?ng, even if someone doesn't think so? Do you agree that it's so or not� "I do agree," he said. "Then don't compel me necessarily to present it as coming into being in every way in deed as we described it in speech. But if we are able to find thata city
