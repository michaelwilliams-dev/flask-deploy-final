summoned a general gathering of his officers, thirty-six in all, and began drinking with them. When the wine had moun- ted into their heads a little, he tried to rouse their spirit still further by addressing them thus: �Gentlemen, here we are in the heart of an isolated region, anxious to achieve riches and honor by some great exploit. Now it happens that an ambassador from the Hsiung-no arrived in this kingdom only a few days ago, and the result is that the respectful courtesy extended towards us by our royal host has disappeared. Should this envoy prevail upon him to seize our party and hand us over to the Hsiung-no, our bones will become food for the wolves of the desert. What are we to do?� With one accord, the officers replied: �Standing as we do in peril of our lives, we will follow our commander through life and death.� For the sequel of this adventure, see chap. XII. ss. 1, note.] 1. We cannot enter into alliance with neighboring princes until we are ac- quainted with their designs. We are not fit to lead an army on the march un- less we are familiar with the face of the country�its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps.

With regard to local guides, Sun Tzu might have added that there is always the risk of going wrong, either through their treachery or some misunderstanding such as Livy records (XXII. 13): Hannibal, we are told, ordered a guide to lead him into the neighborhood of Casinum, where there was an important pass to be occupied; but his Carthaginian accent, unsuited to the pronunciation of Latin names, caused the guide to under- stand Casilinum instead of Casinum, and turning from his proper route, he took the army in that direction, the mistake not being discovered until they had almost arrived.] 1. To be ignored of any one of the following four or five principles does not befit a warlike prince. 2. When a warlike prince attacks a powerful state, his generalship shows it- self in preventing the concentration of the enemy�s forces. He overawes his opponents, and their allies are prevented from joining against him. [Mei Tao-ch�en constructs one of the chains of reasoning that are so much affected by the Chinese: "In attacking a powerful state, if you can divide her forces, you will have a superiority in strength; if you have a superi- ority in strength, you will overawe the enemy; if you overawe the enemy, the neighboring states will be frightened; and if the neighboring states are frightened, the enemy�s
