Eventually youwillemerge victorious, forwhile he con— sidersyouweak andinferior, and takes noprecautions against you, youare using thetime tocatchupandsurpasshim. This soft,penneableform ofin» vasion isoften thebest, fortheenemyhasnothingtoreact against, prepare for, orresist. And hadjapanresisted Western influence byforce, itmight well have suffered adevastating invasion that would have permanentlyal- tered itsculture. Surrender can also offer away ofmocking your enemies, ofturning theirpower against them, asitdidforBrecht. Milan Kundera’s novel 7719 Jake, based ontheauthor’s experiencesinapenal campinCzechoslovakia, tells thestory ofhow theprison guards organizedarelay race, guards against prisoners.Fortheguardsthis was achance toshow offtheir physi- calsuperiority.The prisonersknew theywere expectedtolose, sothey went out oftheirwaytooblige-—miming exaggeratedexertion while barely moving, runningafewyards andcollapsing, limping, joggingever soslowlywhile theguards raced ahead atfullspeed.Both byjoiningthe race andbylosing igtheyhadobligedtheguards obediently;buttheir “overobedience” had mocked theevent tothepointofminingit.Overobe- dience—su.rrender—was here awaytodemonstrate superiorityinare- verse manner. Resistance would have engagedtheprisonersinthecycleof violence, lowering them totheguards’level. Overobeying theguards,how» ever, made them ridiculous, yetthey could notrightly punishtheprison» ers,who hadonlydone what they asked. Power isalwaysinflux—since thegameisbynature fluid, and anarena ofconstant struggle,those withpower almost always find themselves even- tuallyonthedownward swing. Ifyou findyourself temporarily weakened, thesurrender tactic isperfectforraising yourselfup again»-it disguises your ambition; itteaches youpatienceand self—control, keyskills inthegame; anditputs youinthebestpossible positionfortaking advantage ofyour up- pressofssudden slide. Ifyourunawayorfight back, inthelongrunyou cannot win.Ifyousurrender, youwill almost always emergevictorious. Image: AnOak Tree.
