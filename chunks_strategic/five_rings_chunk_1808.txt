Itis best toliberally distribute thegoods ofothers, asdidCyrus, Ceasar, andAlexander. Spending thewealth ofothers tarnishes noreputation butadds toit.Only spending your own resources hurts you. Nothing harms your own resources likeliberality. As youspend, youdeplete theresources forspending. You become either poor orimpoverished, or,toescape poverty, rapacious and hateful. Ofallthings thataPrince needs toavoid arebecoming withdrawn andhated. Liberality leads tothat.

Cesare Borgia wasdeemed cruel. Buthis "cruelty" pacified Romagna, united it,andsubjected it.Truly seen, thiswas more compassion than what theFlorentines did. The Florentines temporized andprocrastinated inPistoia inthe name ofcompassion, only toletthetown bedestroyed. APrince should ignore charges ofcruelty andmake hispriority theunity andfaith ofhissubjects. Many times, itisbetter totake ahard linethan toletcompassion andsoftness leadtodisorder andriots. These arecounter tothepublic good. Disciplinary action only hurts afew—theoffenders. Among Princes, itishardest forthe new Prince toavoid charges ofcruelty, because new states are fullofthreats. Virgil putthese words intothemouth ofDido: Hard political necessity andthenewness of therealm force metotake tough measures anddeploy troops toprotect myrealm. (Aeneid, I,563-564) Atthesame time, thePrince should bedeliberate inbelieving what hehears andinacting norjustcreate fearforthesake of fear. Heshould proceed with prudence and with humanity. Overconfidence should notsupersede caution andcarelessness would only lead tomaking thePrince unpopular. From thisarises thequestion: should aPrince better befeared, orloved? Theanswer is:heshould beboth, butbecause itishard 94— Niccolò Machiavelli tobeboth atthesame time, itismuch safer tobefeared than loved, ifonemust renounce tooneortheother. Ofmen, thiscan generally besaid: they aregenerally ungrateful, over talkative, imitators, dissimulators, cowardly intheface ofdanger, and greedy formoney. When youfavor them they areallonyour side offering their blood, goods, life,andsons, when there isnoreal need. They areallonyour side offering their blood, goods, life, andsons, when there isnoreal need. Butifyoucrowd them, turning thescrews, they revolt. The Prince who relies ontheir word isruined ifhehasnoother defense. Friendship bought with money andnotwith nobility ofsoul may beowing butisnever stable, andinbadtimes youcan’t count onthisfriendship. Men care lessabout offending onewhom they love than onewhom they fear. Love creates abond thatsadly obligates men only as long asitserves their own purpose, butfearishardened bythe sureness ofpunishment andnever letsyoudown. Nevertheless, thePrince must make himself feared insuch a waythat, short ofbeing loved, heisatleast nothated. These two conditions canbevery well linked together. This willhappen eas- ilyaslong asyoulayoffthegoods andwomen ofyour citizens andsubjects. Ifyouhave totake someone's lifedoitwhen there iseasy justification andapparent cause. Above all,don't touch people's possessions. Men forget thedeath ofafather sooner than thelossofhisestate. Reasons fortaking people's property always exist, andonce started down thispath, there isnostopping, but reasons forkilling someone aremore rare, anditiseasier tolie off. When aPrince isleading thearmy, however, andhasalotof soldiers under him, then particularly itisimportant nottocare about having areputation forcruelty. Without thisreputation, itis impossible tokeep thearmy united andprevent them from turn- ingtosome other faction. Among thenoteworthy deeds ofHan- nibal (247-183 B.C.), having alarge army athiscommand, should benoted thathenever letdissension surface even through hecommanded men ofvery different ages onalien terrain. They didn't bicker among themselves oragainst their Prince either in THE PRINCE —95
