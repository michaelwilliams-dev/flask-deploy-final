toexplain away the factthatsome philosophers seem vicious byclaiming thatthey areim- postors. Incomplete, littlemenmove intothepositions leftfreebythe corruption ofthosewhomight trulyhave filled them. Such impostors aremotivated byvanity, andthey arelessinterested inbeing wisethan inbeing reputed wiseandinwinning arguments. Willing tomake the worse argument appear thestronger, they arethesource oftheaccusa- tionthatthephilosophers areteachers ofrhetoric. Inthisterrible sit- uation, thetruephilosophers areisolated, defenseless, andunable to help the city.For theirown preservation they therefore reluctantly withdraw intoprivate life,though their realvocation isruling. These arguments indefense ofphilosophy aredirected tosoothing thepeople's anger andapprehension. TheyshowhowSocrates believes thepeople mustbetalked to.They must, above all,beshown thatheis agood citizen, even though hemayappear useless oreven vicious. Thus heinsists thatthese appearances aretheresult ofafatalmisun- derstanding. He istruly thepeople's friend; heappeals tothem overthe heads oftheir rulers. Heresponds tothegreat accusations against him—thatheisameddler inthings intheheavens andbelow theearth, acorruptor oftheyouth, andadeceiver. However, heissilent about thecharge ofatheism. Having argued thatthecharges against philosophy areunjust, Soc- ratesnowproceeds tosuggest thatthepeople could accept theruleof philosophers. Itisaltogether adifficult business tobring cityand philosopher together, butinthese passages theproblem appears prin- cipally tobetopersuade thepeople toovercome their anger.And Soc- rates' defense seems topersuade atleastonemanwho isvitally con- nected withthepeople— Thrasymachus. Inanyevent Socrates now an- nounces thatThrasymachus hasjustbecome hisfriend. Perhaps this is because Thrasymachus nowbelieves thatSocrates isnolonger athreat tothecity;perhaps itisbecause henow sees that hisrhetoric hasa place inSocrates' enterprise forwhich philosophy alone does not suffice. Socrates hastamed thelionandcannowusehiminthetaming ofthepeople. And Socrates, withThrasymachus' help, willsucceed in [400] Interpretive Essay doing inthedream oftheRepublic whathecould notdointhereal sit- uation oftheApology. Ifhecannot persuade thepeople directly, perhaps hisphilosophic rhetoric, which weseeinthecourse ofthis dialogue, canpersuade thepolitical rhetorician who will inturn per- suade thepeople. Theproblem istoovercome thepeople's moral in- dignation atwhat appears tobeathreat totheirown. Socrates insists thatthepeople willultimately begentle; butindoing so,hementions somany obstacles which stand inthewayofthatgentleness thatheun- dermines hiscase.Heargues thatthere isapossibility thatthepeople willnotbeangered byanattempt totransform their livesandputthem under theabsolute ruleofphilosophers who willtake their property away. Hisarguments only serve tounderline thegreat improbability, nottosayimpossibility, oftheconsummation oftheproject. (503b-540c) Socrates, however, takes itasproven thatthecity, which cannot philosophize, willaccept philosophy, andhenowturns to theproblem oftraining thephilosophers. Butthismeans thathemust treat ofphilosophy itselfandnolonger ofphilosophy asitaffects the city.Asaresult, awhole newworld ofincredible beauty emerges; Glaucon andAdeimantus areshown anunexpected realm, from the standpoint ofwhich everything looks different. IftheRepublic canbe understood asagradual ascent, wehavereached thepeak.Now every- thingmustbeaccomplished bymeans ofimages, forSocrates' students havenopersonal experience ofphilosophy, buttheymust respect itin order tohave theproper perspective onthewhole political question. Socrates introduces thenewtheme when hetellsAdeimantus thatthe study ofjustice, farfrombeing themost important subject, isworthless unless itiscompleted byanother. Thetruescience, towhich theothers areonly ministerial, isthestudy ofthegood. Thiscomes asasurprise toAdeimantus, who istotally devoted tothecity. Itisastepbeyond theearlier recognition thattheideaofjustice transcends anypossible city.Inturn, theidea ofjustice isonlyoneofmany ideas, which are treated inthecomprehensive study ofthegood. Glaucon insists thatSocrates tellmore oftheideaofthegood, and again takes hisbrother's place inthediscussion. Hewasthe firsttoask foranaccount ofjustice interms ofthegood, andhiseroticism impels him topossess thegood things. Socrates formulates hisaccount ofthe good insuch away astoappeal toGlaucon's interest andpassion. Glaucon isinformed ofagoodwhich makes questionable allthegood things ofwhich hespoke inhisoriginal attack onjustice, andtheat- tainment ofwhich requires awayoflifevery different from thetyrant's wayoflife.Socrates leads Glaucon toward theapprehension ofthe goodbymeans ofthethings which Glaucon knows andofwhich hehas [401 ] THEREPUBLIC already spoken. Heagrees that allaction isdirected toward theattain- ment ofsomegoodandthatnone ofthethings hedesires isunam- biguously good. There aremany good things, butnone ofthem
