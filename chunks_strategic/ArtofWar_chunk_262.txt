to lead the reprisals against the rebellious eastern states. The general made a petition to the emperor, stating, �The armed forces of Chu are highly mobile and hard to fight. Let us cede the state of Liang to them and then cut off their supply routes. If we do this, we can stop them.� The emperor agreed to this, and the general went out to join the army. Right at that time, the Wu army was attacking the state of Liang, and the local government of Liang, in desperation, asked the imperial Han general for help. But the general led his troops northeast to a walled city and took up a defensive position there. The king of Liang sent an emissary to plead with the imperial general, but the general kept to his ploy and did not go to the rescue. Now the king of Liang sent an appeal to the emperor himself. The emperor ordered his general to rescue Liang, but the general did not obey the command; instead he fortified the city walls and refused to come out. In the meanwhile, he sent mounted commanders out to cut off the supply routes behind the armies of Wu and Chu. When the armies of Wu and Chu ran low on supplies and were getting so hungry they wanted to go home, they tried to provoke the imperial general into a fight several times. The general, however, never came out. One night there was a fearful commotion in the camp of the imperial general, as fighting started. The fighting spread to the skirts of the general�s tent, but he lay there stoically and would not get up. After a while the disturbance died down. The Wu army rushed the southeast corner of the city, so the imperial general had defenses built up on the northwest perimeter. Before long the Wu army did in fact rush the northwest wall, but they could not get in. Now the armies of Wu and Chu were starving, so they withdrew and started back to their homelands. At this point the imperial general sent his best soldiers out to run them down, and his men routed the troops of Wu and Chu. The king of Chu abandoned his armed forces and ran away with a few thousand bodyguards to hole up south of the Long River. The army of the Han empire now took advantage of this victory to chase the Chu armies down and catch them all, conquering the territories of Chu. The imperial general of the Han sent out an order, saying, �Anyone who gets the king of Wu will be given a reward of a thousand pieces of gold.� In little more than a month, a man of Yue, a state neighboring Wu, showed up with the head of the king of Wu. The whole civil war had taken seven months; Wu and Chu were completely pacified. Postponing Battle Liu Ji said: In war, when adversaries are orderly in their movements and
