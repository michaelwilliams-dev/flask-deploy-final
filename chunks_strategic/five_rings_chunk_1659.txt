queen mother grewstill more dependentonhim, and in1622 sherepaidhim for hisloyalty: Through theintercession ofherallies inRome, Richelieu was elevated tothepowerfulrank ofcardinal. By1623 King Louis was introuble. Hehad no one hecould trust to advise him, andalthoughhewas now ayoungman instead ofaboy,here mained childish inspirit,and affairs ofstate came hard tohim. Now that he had taken thethrone, Marie was nolonger theregent andtheoreticallyhad nopower,but she still had her son’s ear. and shekept tellinghim that Richelieu was hisonly possiblesavior. Atfirst Louis would have none of it——-he hated thecardinal with apassion, only toleratinghim outoflove for Marie. Intheend, however, isolated inthe court andcrippled byhis own iudecisiveness, heyieldedtohismother and made Richelieu fixst hischief Councilor and later primeminister. Now Richelieu nolongerneeded Marie deMédicis. Hestoppedvisit- ingandcourting her,stopped listeningtoheropinions,even arguedwith herandopposedherwishes. Instead beconcentrated ontheking, making himself indispensabletohisnew master. Alltheprevious premiers,under standingtheking’s childishness, had tried tokeephim outoftrouble; the shrewd Richelieu playedhimdifferently, deliberately pushinghim into one ambitious project after another, such as acrusade against the Huguenots andfinallyanextended war with Spain.Theimmensityof these projects only made thekingmore dependentonhispowerful pre- mier, theonlyman able tokeeporder intherealm. And so,forthenext eighteen years, Richelieu, exploiting theking’s weaknesses, governedand molded France accordingtohis own vision, unifying thecountry and mak- ingitastrong European powerforcenturies tocome. lntcipretation Richelieu saweverythingasamilitary campaign, and nostrategicmove was more importanttohim than discovering hisenemy’s weaknesses and applying pressuretothem. Asearlyashisspeeohin1615, he waslooking fortheweak link inthechain ofpower, and hesaw that itwas thequeen mother, Not that Marie wasobviously weakmslie governedboth France andher son; butRichelieu saw that she wasreallyaninsecure woman who needed constant masculine attention. Heshowered herwith afiection and respect,even toadying uptoherfavorite, Concini. Heknew thedaywould come when thekingwould take over, buthealso recognized that Louis loved hismotherdearlyand would always remain achild inrelation toher. Thewaytocontrol Louis, then, was notbygaininghisfavor, which could change overnight, butbygaining swayover hismother, forwhom hisafv fection would never change. Once Richelieu had thepositionhedesiredm-primeminister———he dis- carded thequeen mother, movingontothenext weak link inthechain: theking‘sown character. There was apart ofhim that would alwaysbe a. helpless child inneed ofhigher authority.Itwas onthefoundation ofthe king’s weakness that Richelieu established his ownpowerand fame. Remember: When enteringthecourt, find theweak link. Theperson incontrol isoften notthekingorqueen;itissomeone behind the scenes-« thefavorite, thehusband orwife, even thecourt fool. Thisperson may have more weaknesses than theking himself, because hispower depends onallkinds ofcapricious factors outside hiscontrol. Finally, when dealing with helplesschildren who cannot make deci- sions, playontheir weakness andpush them into bold ventures, They will have todependonyoueven more, foryou will become theadult figure whom theyrelyontogetthem outofscrapesand tosafety.
