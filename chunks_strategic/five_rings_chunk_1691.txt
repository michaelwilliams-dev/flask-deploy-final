Bertolt Brecht underwent amodern form ofInquisition—tl1e House Un—American Activities Committee-and approacheditwith considerable canniness. Having worked offand onintheAmerican filmindustry during World WarII,in1947 Brecht wassummoned toappearbefore thecommit- teetoanswer quesfionsonhissuspected Communist sympathies. Other writers called before thecommittee made apoint ofattacking itsmembers, andofactingasbelligerentlyaspossibleinorder togain sympathyfor themselves. Brecht, ontheother hand, who hadactuallyworked stead» lastlyfortheCommunist cause, played theopposite game: Heanswered questionswith ambiguous generalitiesthat defied easy interpretation. Call ittheCarnpanella strategy.Brecht even were asuit————a rare event forhim—- andmade apointofsmokingacigar during theproceedings, knowing that akeycommittee member had apassion forcigars. Intheend hecharmed thecommittee members, who lethim goscobfree.

His outward conformityinboth casesgavehim thefreedom towork unhindered, with outhavingtochangehisthinking.

Notonly dopeopleofpower avoid theoffenses ofPausanias andSalk, they also learn toplay theclever foxandfeignthe common touch. This has been theployofcon artists andpoliticians throughout thecenturies. Lead- erslikeJuliusCaesar and Franklin D.Roosevelt have overcome their nab ural aristocratic stance tocultivate afamiliaritywith the common man. Theyhave expressedthisfamiliarityinlittle gestures,often symbolic,to show thepeople thattheir leaders share popular values, despitetheir differ- entstatus.

When you gointo society, leave behindyourown ideas and values, and putonthemask that ismost appropriateforthe groupinwhich youfindyourself.
