group is like directing a single individual with no other choice. DU MU People having no other choice is a metaphor for the ease with which they can be directed. Master Sun The business of the general is quiet and secret, fair and orderly. MEI YAOCHEN If you are quiet and inconspicuous, others will not be able to figure you out. If you are accurate and orderly, others will not be able to disturb you. ZHANG YU His plans are calm and deeply hidden, so no one can figure them out. His regime is fair and orderly, so no one dares take him lightly. Master Sun He can keep the soldiers unaware, make them ignorant.

Master Sun Generally, the way it is with invaders is that they unite when deep in enemy territory but are prone to dissolve while on the fringes. When you leave your country and cross the border on a military operation, that is isolated ground. When it is accessible from all directions, it is trafficked ground.
