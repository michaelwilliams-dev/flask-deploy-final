certainly a great improve- ment on the above; but unfortunately there appears to be no very good authority for the variant. Chang Yu reminds us that the saying only applies if the other factors are equal; a small difference in numbers is often more than counterbalanced by superior energy and discipline.] if quite unequal in every way, we can flee from him. 1. Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a small force, in the end it must be captured by the larger force. 2. Now the general is the bulwark of the State; if the bulwark is complete at all points; the State will be strong; if the bulwark is defective, the State will be weak. [As Li Ch�uan tersely puts it: "Gap indicates deficiency; if the general�s ability is not perfect (i.e. if he is not thoroughly versed in his profession), his army will lack strength."] 1. There are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his army: 2. (1) By commanding the army to advance or to retreat, being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey. This is called hobbling the army. [Li Ch�uan adds the comment: "It is like tying together the legs of a thor- oughbred, so that it is unable to gallop." One would naturally think of "the ruler" in this passage as being at home, and trying to direct the movements of his army from a distance. But the commentators understand just the reverse, and quote the saying of T�ai Kung: "A kingdom should not be governed from without, and army should not be directed from within." Of course it is true that, during an engagement, or when in close touch with the enemy, the general should not be in the thick of his own troops, but a little distance apart. Otherwise, he will be liable to misjudge the position as a whole, and give wrong orders.] 1. (2) By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in an army. This causes restlessness in the soldier�s minds. [Ts�ao Kung�s note is, freely translated: "The military sphere and the civil sphere are wholly distinct; you can�t handle an army in kid gloves." And Chang Yu says: "Humanity and justice are the principles on which to govern a state, but not an army; opportunism and flexibility, on the other hand, are military rather than civil virtues to assimilate the governing of an army"�to that of a State, understood.] 1. (3) By employing the officers of his army without discrimination, [That is, he is not careful to use the right man in the right place.] CHAPTER 4. ATTACK BY STRATAGEM 41 through ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to circumstances. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers. [I follow Mei Yao-ch�en here. The other commentators refer not to the ruler, as in SS. 13, 14, but to the officers he employs. Thus Tu Yu says:
