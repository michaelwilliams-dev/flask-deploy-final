to bring city and philosopher together, but in these passages the problem appears prin? cipally to be to persuade the people to overcome their anger. And Soc? rates' defense seems to persuade at least one man who is vitaUy con? nected with the people-Thrasymachus. In any event Socrates now an? nounces that Thrasymachus has just become his friend. Perhaps this is because Thrasymachus now believes that S9crates is no longer a threat to the city; perhaps it is because he now sees that his rhetoric has a place in Socrates' enterprise for which philosophy alone does not suffice. Socrates has tamed the lion and can now use him in the taming of the people. And Socrates, with Thrasymachus' help, will succeed in doing in the dream of the Republic what he could notï¿½do in the real sit? uation of the Apology. If he cannot persuade the people directly, perhaps his philosophic rhetoric, which we see in the course of this dialogue, can persuade the political rhetorician who will in tum per? suade the people. The problem is to overcome the people's moral in? dignation at what appears to be a threat to their own. Socrates insists that the people will ultimately be gentle; but in doing so, he mentions so many obstacles which stand in the way of that gentleness that he un? dermines his case. He argues that there is a possibility that the people will not be angered by an attempt to transform their lives and put them under the absolute rule of philosophers who will take their property away. His arguments only serve to underline the great improbability, not to say impossibility, of the consummation of the project. (503b-540c) Socrates, however, takes it as proven that the city, which cannot philosophize, will accept philosophy, and he now turns to the problem of training the philosophers. But this means that he must treat of philosophy itself and no longer of philosophy as it affects the city. As a result, a whole new world of incredible beauty emerges; Glaucon and Adeimantus are shown an unexpected realm, from the standpoint of which everything looks different. If the Republic can be understood as a gradual ascent, we have reached the peak. Now every? thing must be accomplished by means of images, for Socrates' students have no personal experience of philosophy, but they must respect it in order to have the proper perspective on the whole political question. Socrates introduces the new theme when he tells Adeimantus that the study of justice, far from being the most important subject, is worthless unless it is completed by another. The true science, to which the others are only ministerial, is the study of the good. This comes as a surprise to Adeimantus, who is totally devoted to the city. It is a step beyond the earlier recognition that the idea of justice transcends any possible city. In turn, the idea of justice is only one of many ideas, which are treated in the comprehensive
