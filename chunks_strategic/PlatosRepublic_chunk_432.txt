ridiculed in the Clouds. It is in this way that he proved his superiority to Aristophanes. 1. Hesiod, Works and Days, 106-201, should be consulted in reference to the entire discussion of the transformation of regimes. 2. Iliad, VI, 211. The context of the quote should be read. 3. Cf. Seven Against Thebes, 451, 570. 4. The Greek is timema; allied to the word for honor (cf. 545b, note 3). The connection between the two notions is valuing. This term makes the transition from timocracy to oligarchy more pointed. 5. Penes, a poor man in the sense that he must work for his living. 6. This is a play on the etymological sense of the word, composed of elements m aning "few" and "rulers." 7. This expression can have the technical sense of "loss of civic rights." 8. The great king was the ruler of the Persian empire, and these were luxurious signs of his office. 9. Probably a reference to the god Plutus, who is represented as blind. His name means simply "wealth." (Cf. Aristophanes, Plutus, 90.) 10. Tokos (cf. 507a, note 31). 11. The sentence is ambiguous; "of' could be substituted for "toward" here. 12. The heroes, divine beings, were present but not seen. 13. The word for "money-making," chrematistike, is close to the word for "useful," chresimos. This is a play on that similarity. 1. The words for "embassy" and "older man" have a cominonï¿½root (cf. 509b, note 34). 2. Cf. Thucydides, Ill, bcodi, 4. 3. The passage alludes to the Eleusinian Mysteries, the sacred and se? cret initiations that took place in Attica. The language here has a religous solemnity. The first days of this festival were devofed to purifications, and then there was a spectacular torchlight procession lea,ding the god lacchus (Dionysus) from Athens back to Eleusis where the initiations took place. This calls to mind the all-but-forgotten torch race promised at 328a. 4. This description should be compared with Pericles' funeral oration (Thucydides, II, xxvii-xli). 5. Cf. Xenophon, The Athenian Republic, I, 8-12. 6. We do not possess the play from which this quote comes, nor do we know anything of its context. It is possible that the phrase was not in a play but was said by Aeschylus in his defense when accused of revealing the secrets of the Mysteries. This would be an appropriate context for Socrates to use an utterance with such overtones (cf. Aristotle, Ethics, lllla, 9ff.). 7. The proverb was "like mistress, like dog," with the ambiguity that dog was taken in the sense of servant. Socrates takes it literally. 8. Lycaon, an ancient hero, founded a sanctuary on the Lycaean moun? tains in Arcadia. Among the offerings he sacrificed there was a child. As punishment he was turned into a wolf (Greek, lykos). In historical times, the priest who performed the sacrifice every ninth year was forced to Hee and wan? der about until the next sacrifice. According to popular legend, he was a wolf during this period.
