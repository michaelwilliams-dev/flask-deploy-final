who are unable to split up others� armies and control others� forces are inadequate even if they have several times the firepower. One aspect of force splitting is the deliberate dividing of attention. This type of strategy is common and general in application, as in the advice of Sun Wu to �Strike where they are unprepared, emerge when they are least anticipating it,� and the counsel of Sun Bin to �Attack where they are unprepared, act when they least expect it.� This sense of opportune time and place is, furthermore, not simply a matter of the enemy�s concrete preparedness, but also a question of mental energy and morale. Sun Wu advises, �Good warriors avoid keen spirits, instead striking enemies when their spirits are fading and waning.� To this may be added, pursuant to the already stipulated need to know both others and self in order to act effectively, Sun Bin�s essential caveat: �Act only when prepared.� The critical discernment of power configurations, of the relationships between one�s own states and those of opponents, is underscored in Sun Wu�s summary of this aspect of tactical strategy: �The ancients who were skilled in combat first became invincible, and in that condition awaited vulnerability on the part of enemies.� The economy of this approach is strongly emphasized in Sun Bin�s suggestion that the best preparation is that which enables you to avoid embroilment in persistent hostilities: �Intelligent governments and commanders with knowledge of military science must prepare first; then they can achieve success before fighting.� Preparation sufficient to secure victory in advance requires knowledge of environmental factors. Both the elder master, Sun Wu, and his successor, Sun Bin, emphasize the importance of prior knowledge. Sun Bin says, �It is imperative to know what ground is viable and what ground is deadly; occupy the viable and attack the deadly.� Here Sun Wu goes into some detail, specifying the appropriate measures to take on particular grounds: On a ground of disintegration, do not fight. On shallow ground, do not halt. On a ground of contention, do not attack. On a ground of intercourse, do not get cut off. On axial ground, make alliances. On deep ground, plunder. On bad ground, keep going. On surrounded ground, plan ahead. On deadly ground, fight. The timing of an operation is as critical as the field of operation. Sun Bin says, �Fight only when you are sure to win, without letting anyone know.� Concentration and targeted release of power require inward certainty and outward security for maximum efficiency, as illustrated by Sun Wu�s dictum that �Crushing force is due to timing and control.� It is not enough to have the power; it must be focused and directed, as Sun Bin says: �When your forces are larger and more powerful, and yet you still ask about how to employ them, this is the way to guarantee your nation�s security.� Reliance on superior force is not merely risky but intrinsically costly, since it depends on the logic of expenditure.
