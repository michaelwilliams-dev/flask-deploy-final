because thephilosophers have notyeteducated adefense force withwhich tocompel thepeople. Theperfect city isrevealed tobea perfect impossibility. What thenwastheuseofspending somuch timeand effort ona citythat isimpossible? Precisely toshow itsimpossibility. Thiswasnot justany city,butoneconstructed tomeet allthedemands ofjustice. Its impossibility demonstrates theimpossibility oftheactualization ofa justregime andhence moderates themoral indignation amanmight experience atthesight ofless-than-perfect regimes. Theextreme spirit ofreform orrevolution loses itsground ifitsend isquestionable. Ifthe infinite longing forjustice onearth ismerely adream oraprayer, the shedding ofblood initsname turnsfrom idealism intocriminality. The revolutions ofCommunism orFascism aremade inthename ofperfect [409 ] THEREPUBLIC regimes which aretobetheir consequence. What matter ifafew million dienow, ifone issure thatcountless generations ofmankind willenjoy thefruits ofjustice? Socrates thinks about theendwhich is ultimately aimed atbyallreformers orrevolutionaries buttowhich theydonotpay sufficient attention. Heshows what aregime would have tobeinorder tobejustandwhysuch aregime isimpossible. Regimes canbeimproved butnotperfected; injustice willalways re- main.Theproper spirit ofreform, then, ismoderation. Socrates con- structs hisUtopia topointupthedangers ofwhatwewould callutop- ianism; assuch itisthegreatest critique ofpolitical idealism ever written. TheRepublic serves tomoderate theextreme passion for political justice byshowing thelimits ofwhatcanbedemanded andex- pected ofthecity; and, atthesame time, itshows thedirection in which theimmoderate desires canbemeaningfully channeled. Atthe beginning ofthedialogue, Glaucon andAdeimantus settheseverest standards forpolitical justice. Inorder totrytomeet those standards, theywould have toestablish aterrible tyranny andwould failnever- theless. Socrates leadsthem firsttothefulfillment oftheirwishes, andthen beyond, toafullfillment which does notdepend onthetransforma- tionofhuman nature. The striving fortheperfectly just cityputs unreasonable anddespotic demands onordinary men,and itabuses and misuses thebestmen. There isgentleness inSocrates' treatment of men,andhisvision isnever clouded bytheblackness ofmoral indigna- tion, forheknows what toexpect ofmen. Political idealism isthemost destructive ofhiiman passions. AllofWestern man's aspirations tojustice andthegood lifeare given expression andfulfillment inSocrates' proposals foracity.This isaregime where men's faculties arenotdenied their exercise by poverty, birth, orsex,where theaccidental attachments offamily and citydonotlimit aman's understanding andpursuit ofthegood; itisa regime, finally, where wise, public-spirited men rule forthecommon good. But thisregime canonlybeachieved atthesacrifice ofother treasured things towhich wearelessreasonably, butperhaps more powerfully, inclined. These areproperty, family, andthecityofone's birth— allthethings amancanlove ashisown; they existeverywhere andexisted longbefore theemergence ofphilosophy. Notonlydothese things constitute thecharm oflifeformostmen, they alsoprovide the occasion fortheacquisition andtheexercise ofmost ofthevirtues which cangiveordinary men dignity. Ifreason requires Socrates' city, loveoffamily andfriends, patriotism, andevenheroism demand theold- erkind ofcity.Man's dual nature makes itimpossible tosolve the [410 J Interpretive Essay problem posed bythetwokinds ofgoods. Every decent regime issome kindofiineasy compromise between them. Socrates' scheme, inaspirit ofcomedy, proposes thetriumph ofthesidewhich represents thesoul, theside towhich thebestkind ofmancanbealmost totally devoted, theonly rational side.Thenon-barbaric society isdefined byopenness tothispartofman's longing; thisopenness tophilosophy isthevery definition ofcivilization andcarries with itatendency towish forthe actualization oftheregime ofthephilosopher-kings. Itisthelight in thecavewhich Socrates andthose nearhimfought topreserve when its infancy was soseverely threatened. But toforget theother sideof man— toneglect theirony ofSocrates' proposals— isalsoafatal error. Thecosmopolitan communistic society ofegalitarian man isadistor- tionofmanandthecitywhich ismore terrible thanbarbarism. Inact- ingasthough theeternal tension between bodyandsoulhasbeen over- comebyhistory, asociety isconstituted which satisfies neither body norsoul.Such asociety creates oneuniversal caveilluminated byanar- tificial light, formenhave notmade thesacrifices necessary totheat- tainment oftruecosmopolitanism buthavebeenrobbed ofthose at- tachments which cangivethem depth. Thethinkers oftheEnlighten- ment, culminating inMarx, preserved Socrates' ultimate goals but forgot hisinsistence thatnature madethem impossible formen atlarge. Onlybydistorting ornarrowing man's horizon canthepermanent duality inhisnature beovercome. TheRepublic finally teaches thatjustice astotal dedication tothe citycannot
