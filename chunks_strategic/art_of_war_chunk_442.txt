of communications and occupy the roads by which he will have to return; if we are the invaders, we may direct our attack against the sovereign him- self." It is clear that Sun Tzu, unlike certain generals in the late Boer war, was no believer in frontal attacks.] 12. If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy from engaging us even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the ground. All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in his way. [This extremely concise expression is intelligibly paraphrased by Chia Lin: "even though we have constructed neither wall nor ditch." Li Ch�uan says: "we puzzle him by strange and unusual dispositions;" and Tu Mu finally clinches the meaning by three illustrative anecdotes�one of Chu-ko Liang, who when occupying Yang-p�ing and about to be attacked by Ssu- ma I, suddenly struck his colors, stopped the beating of the drums, and flung open the city gates, showing only a few men engaged in sweeping and sprinkling the ground. This unexpected proceeding had the intended effect; for Ssu-ma I, suspecting an ambush, actually drew off his army and retreated. What Sun Tzu is advocating here, therefore, is nothing more nor less than the timely use of "bluff."] 13. By discovering the enemy�s dispositions and remaining invisible ourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated, while the enemy�s must be divided. [The conclusion is perhaps not very obvious, but Chang Yu (after Mei Yao- ch�en) rightly explains it thus: "If the enemy�s dispositions are visible, we can make for him in one body; whereas, our own dispositions being kept secret, the enemy will be obliged to divide his forces in order to guard against attack from every quarter."] 14. We can form a single united body, while the enemy must split up into fractions. Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate parts of a whole, which means that we shall be many to the enemy�s few. 1. CHAPTER 7. WEAK POINTS AND STRONG 56 15. And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior one, our opponents will be in dire straits. 16. The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then the enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several different points; [Sheridan once explained the reason of General Grant�s victories by say- ing that "while his opponents were kept fully employed wondering what he was going to do, HE was thinking most of what he was going to do himself."] and his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers we shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few. 17. For should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear; should he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should he strengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his right, he will weaken his left.
