as a pound�s weight placed in the scale against a single grain. [Literally, "a victorious army is like an I (20 oz.) weighed against a SHU (1/24 oz.); a routed army is a SHU weighed against an I." The point is simply the enormous advantage which a disciplined force, flushed with victory, has over one demoralized by defeat." Legge, in his note on Men- cius, I. 2. ix. 2, makes the I to be 24 Chinese ounces, and corrects Chu Hsi�s statement that it equaled 20 oz. only. But Li Ch�uan of the T�ang dynasty here gives the same figure as Chu Hsi.] 1. The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep. Chapter 6 ENERGY 1. Sun Tzu said: The control of a large force is the same principle as the control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers. [That is, cutting up the army into regiments, companies, etc., with sub- ordinate officers in command of each. Tu Mu reminds us of Han Hsin�s famous reply to the first Han Emperor, who once said to him: "How large an army do you think I could lead?" "Not more than 100,000 men, your Majesty." "And you?" asked the Emperor. "Oh!" he answered, "the more the better."] 1. Fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different from fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting signs and signals. 2. To ensure that your whole host may withstand the brunt of the enemy�s attack and remain unshaken - this is effected by maneuvers direct and in- direct. [We now come to one of the most interesting parts of Sun Tzu�s treatise, the discussion of the CHENG and the CH�I." As it is by no means easy to grasp the full significance of these two terms, or to render them consist- ently by good English equivalents; it may be as well to tabulate some of the commentators� remarks on the subject before proceeding further. Li Ch�uan: "Facing the enemy is CHENG, making lateral diversion is CH�I. Chia Lin: "In presence of the enemy, your troops should be arrayed in nor- mal fashion, but in order to secure victory abnormal maneuvers must be employed." Mei Yao-ch�en: "CH�I is active, CHENG is passive; passivity means waiting for an opportunity, activity beings the victory itself." Ho Shih: "We must cause the enemy to regard our straightforward attack as one that is secretly designed, and vice versa; thus CHENG may also be CH�I, and CH�I may also be CHENG." He instances the famous exploit of Han Hsin, who when marching ostensibly against Lin- chin (now Chao-i 47 CHAPTER 6. ENERGY 48 in Shensi), suddenly threw a large force across the Yellow River in wooden tubs, utterly disconcerting his opponent. [Ch�ien Han Shu, ch. 3.] Here, we are told, the march on Lin-chin was CHENG, and the surprise man- euver was CH�I." Chang
