the effective use of spies depends on the leadership. Master Sun says, �One cannot use spies without sagacity and knowledge, one cannot use spies without humanity and justice, one cannot get the truth from spies without subtlety,� and he concludes, �Only a brilliant ruler or a wise general who can use the highly intelligent for espionage is sure of great success.� Historical Background The Art of War was evidently written during the so-called Warring States period of ancient China, which lasted from the fifth to the third century B.C.E. This was a time of protracted disintegration of the Chou (Zhou) dynasty, which had been founded over five hundred years earlier by the political sages who wrote the I Ching. The collapse of the ancient order was marked by destabilization of interstate relationships and interminable warfare among aspirants to hegemony in the midst of ever-shifting patterns of alliance and opposition. A preface to Strategies of the Warring States (Zhanguo ce/Chan kuo ts�e), a classic collection of stories about the political and military affairs of the feudal states of this time, provides a graphic description of the Warring States period: Usurpers set themselves up as lords and kings, states run by pretenders and plotters set up armies to make themselves super-powers. Increasingly they imitated one another in this, and their posterity followed their example. Eventually they engulfed and destroyed each other, colluding with larger territories and annexing smaller territories, passing years in violent military operations, filling the fields with bloodshed. Fathers and sons were not close to each other, brothers were not secure with each other, husbands and wives separated�no one could safeguard his or her life. Virtue disappeared. In later years this grew increasingly extreme, with seven large states and five small states contesting each other for power. In general, this was because the Warring States were shamelessly greedy, struggling insatiably to get ahead. The great humanist philosopher and educator Confucius, who lived right on the eve of the Warring States era, spent his life working against the deterioration in human values that marked the fall of his society into centuries of conflict. In the classic Analects of Confucius, the imminent dawn of the Warring States period is presaged in a symbolic vignette of Confucius� encounter with a ruler whom he tried to advise: �Lord Ling of the state of Wei asked Confucius about battle formations. Confucius replied, �I have learned about the disposition of ritual vessels, but I have not studied military matters,� and left the next day.� This story, as if representing the disappearance of humanity (�Confucius left the next day�) from the thoughts and considerations of rulers in the coming centuries of war, is taken up by the Taoist philosopher Chuangtzu, who lived in the fourth and third centuries B.C.E., right in the midst of the Warring States period. According to Chuangtzu�s enlargement on the theme, Yen Hui, the most enlightened disciple of Confucius, went to the teacher and asked about going to the state of Wei. Confucius
