Their first efforts attracted some interest from literary agents, butitsputtered.Thepromise theyhad shown wasleadingnowhere. Eventuallytheinheritancemoneyranout, and thepair had tolook for work. Their collaborations were lessenthusiastic and lessfrequent.The fu~ ture looked bleak. In1957 Orton begantowrite onhisown, butitwasn’t until fiveyears later, when thelovers were jailed forsixmonths fordefacing dozens ofli- brary books, that hebegantofind hisvoice (perhapsnotbychance: This was thefirst time heand Halliwell had been separatedinnine years).He came outofprison determined toexpresshiscontempt forEnglish society intheform oftheatrical farces. HeandHalliwell moved back intogether, but now theroles were reversed: Orton didthewriting while Halliwellput incomments and ideas. In1964joeOrton completedhisfirstfull-length play, EntertainingMr. Sloane. Theplaymade ittoLondon’s West End, where itreceived brilliant reviews: Agreatnew writer hademerged from nowhere. Now success fol- lowed siccess, atadizzying pace. In1966 Orton had ahitwith hisplay Loot, and hispopularitysoared. Soon commissions came infrom allsides, includingfrom theBeatles, who paid Orton handsomely towrite them a filmscript Everythingwaspointing upwards, everything exceptOrton’s relation» ship with Kenneth Halliwell. The pairstilllived together,but asOrton grew successful, Halliwell begantodeteriorate. Watchinghislover become thecenter ofattention, hesuffered thehumiliation ofbecomingakind of personalassistant totheplaywright,hisrole inwhat had once been acol- laboration growing smaller and smaller. Inthe l950s hehadsupported Orton with hisinheritance; now Orton supportedhim. At apartyor among friends, peoplewould naturally gravitatetowards Orton-—he was charming, and hismood was almost always buoyant Unlike thehandsome Orton, Halliwell was bald andawkward; hisdefensiveness made people want toavoid him. With Orton’s success thecouple‘s problems only worsened. Halliwell’s moods made their lifetogether impossible.
