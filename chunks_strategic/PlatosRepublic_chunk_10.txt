Cornford a reader about whom Plato would care? And does the gain in immediate intelligibi1ity or beauty offset the loss in substance? Only unawareness of the problems can account for such a perverse skewing of the emphases. And this was a sentence cho? sen by Cornford to demonstrate the evident superiority of his pro? cedure! There are a whole series of fundamental te1ms like virtue. Nature and city are but two of the most important which are most often mis? translated. I have tried to indicate a number of them in the notes when they first occur. They are translated as they have been by the great authors in the philosophic tradition. Above all, I have avoided using terms of recent origin for which it is difficult to find an exact Greek equivalent, inasmuch as they are likely to be the ones which most reflect specifically modem tbought. It is, of course, impossible always to trans]ate every Greek word in the same way. But the on]y standard for change was the abso1ute uninte11igibi1ity of the rendition and not any desire to inake P]ato sound better or to add variety where he might seem monotonous. And the most crucia1 words, Jike those just men? tioned and form and regime, etc., are a1ways the same in spite of the difficu1ties this procedure sometimes causes. Ordinarily in con? temporary trans1ations the occurrence of, for examp1e, nature in the Eng1ish is no indication that there is anything re1ated to physis in the Greek, and the occurrence of physis in the Greek does not regu]arly ca11 forth any word related to nature from the trans1ator. But, since nature is the standard for P]ato, this confusion causes the reader either to be ignorant of the fact that nature is indeed Plato's standard or to mistake which phenomena he considers natural. Literal translation makes the Republic a dillicu]t book to read; but it is in itseff a difficult bock, and our historica1 situation makes it doub]y difficl.llt for us. This must not be hidden.;P1ato intended his works essentia11y for the in? te11igent and industri?us few, a natura1 aristocracy determined neither by birth nor wea1th/and this translation attempts to do nothing which wou]d contradict that intention. Inï¿½ addition to unawareness of the need for precision, unwi11- ingness to accept certain unpa1atab1e or shocking statements or teach? ings is another cause of deviation from litera1ness. This unwi1lingness is due either to a refusa] to be1ieve Plato says what he means or to a desire to make him respectable. Cornford provides again a spectacu]ar example of a not too uncommon tendency. At Book III 414 Socrates te1ls of the need for a "noble Jie" to be be1ieved in the city he and his companions are founding (in speech). Cornford ca11s it a"bold flight of invention" and adds the fo1lowing note: "This phrase is commonly ren? dered 'noble He,' a self-contradictory expression no more applicable to Plato's harmless al1egory than to a New Testament parable or the Pilgrim's Progress, and liab]e
