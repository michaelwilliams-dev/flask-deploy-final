The French and theEnglish begantocompare Bismarck toAttila the Hun, and tofear that hehaddesignsonallofEurope.Once hehad started onthepathtoconquest,there was notellingwhere hewould stop. And, indeed, threeyears later Bismarck provokedawar with France. First he appearedtogivehispermissiontoFrance’s annexation ofBelgium,then atthelast moment hechangedhismind.Playingacaband-mouse game, heinfuriated theFrench emperor, Napoleon Ill, and stirred uphis own king againsttheFrench.

The newlyformed German federation enthusiastically joinedinthe war onFrance, and once again the Prussian military machine and itsallies destroyedtheenemy armyinamatter ofmonths. Although Bismarck opposed taking any French land, thegeneralsconvinced him that Alsace- Lorraine would become part ofthefederation. Now all ofEuropefeared the next move ofthePrussian monster, led byBismarck, the“Iron Chancellor.” And infact ayearlater Bismarck founded the German Empire,with the Prussian kingasthenewly crowned emperor and Bismarck himself aprince.But then something strange happened:Bismarck instigatednomore wars.
