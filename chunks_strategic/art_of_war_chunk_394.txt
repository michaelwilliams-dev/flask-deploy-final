art of flexibility,� which was the ancient form of judo. (100) Although in the dictionaries I consulted I did not find any indication of affinity between these two words, their meanings are often used in association with practical explanations of jujutsu. For example, when I was learning jujutsu under the tutelage of Master Kubota Shozan between 1975 and 1980 in Japan, he explained the meaning of the word ju by completing it with the meaning of the word jiyu. Following his explanations of technique, he often added, �Ju wa jiyu. Jiyu deareba yawarakai.� (�Flexibility means freedom. If one is free, one is flexible.�) I interpret this as follows: The flexibility of jujutsu aims at the freedom of the body that is derived from perfect mastery of the body. If one is free in the body, the mind is also free. It is at this point that one can acquire true flexibility. Master Kubota did not invent this association of the words ju, jiyu, and yawaraka. He himself learned it from his teacher. I have also heard this expression on other occasions, in connection with the practice of the martial arts of kenjutsu and karate. Even though these connections are not reported in the dictionaries, I think it should be pointed out that these ideas are transmitted together in the practice of the martial arts. This helps to clarify Musashi�s text. 75. On the sole copy of the Gorin no sho that has come down to us today, mention is added of a transmission later in 1667. 76. The work is composed in five scrolls, and each scroll is signed and dated in the same way. For more information on this and other books from Shambhala, please visit www.shambhala.com.
