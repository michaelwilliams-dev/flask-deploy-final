You dream of traveling to exotic places, but if you go there, you merely drag with you your own discontented frame of mind.

But if we really think very highly of a person, we should conceal it from him like a crime. This is not a very gratifying thing to do, but it is right. Why, a dog will not bear being treated too kindly, let alone a man! �Arthur Schopenhauer 6 Elevate Your Perspective The Law of Shortsightedness I t is in the animal part of your nature to be most impressed by what you can see and hear in the present�the latest news reports and trends, the opinions and actions of the people around you, whatever seems the most dramatic.
