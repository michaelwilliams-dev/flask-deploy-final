in straightening out other people's troubles; but he asks for wages, because the man 345. a who is to do anything fine by art never does what is best for himself nor does he command it, insofar as he is commanding by art, but rather what is best for the man who is ruled. It is for just this reason, as it seems, that there must be wages for those who are going to be wi]Jing to rule-either money, or honor, or a penalty if he should not rule." "What do you mean by that, Socrates?" said Glaucon. "The first two kinds of wages I know, but I don't understand what penalty you mean and how you can say it is a kind of wage." "Then you don't understand the wages of the best men," I said, 347, "on account of which the most decent men rule, whell they are willing to rule. Or don't you know that love of honor and love of money are said to be, and are, reproaches?" "I do indeed," he said. "For this reason, therefore," I said, "the good aren't willing to rule for the sake of money or honor. For they don't wish openly to ex? act wages for ruling and get called hirelings, nor on their own secretly to take a profit from their ruling and get called thieves. Nor, again, will they rule for the sake of honor. For they are not lovers of honor. Hence, necessity and a penalty must be there in addition for them, if they are going to be willing to rule-it is likely that this is the source of its being held to be shameful to seek to rule and not to await necessity-and the greatest of penalties is being ruled by a worse man if one is not willing to rule oneself. It is because they fear this, in my view, that decent men rule, when they do rule; and at that time they proceed to enter on rule, not as though they were going to something good, or as though they were going to be well off in it; but they enter on it as a necessity and because they have no one better than or like them? selves to whom to tum it over. For it is likely that if a city of good men came to be, there would be a fight over not ruling, just as there is nowï¿½ over ruling; and there it would become manifest that a true ruler really does not naturally consider his own advantage but rather that of the one who is ruled. Thus everyone who knows would choose to be benefited by another rather than to take the trouble of benefiting another. So I can in no way agree with Thrasymachus that the just is the advantage of the stronger. But this we shall consider again at another time. What Thrasymachus now says is in my own opinion a far bigger thing-he asserts that the
