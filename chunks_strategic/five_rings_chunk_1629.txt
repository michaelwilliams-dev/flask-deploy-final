bear their hair, others would laugh hysterically.Attheheight ofthedelirium Mesmer would reenter thesalon, dressed inaflowing silkrobe embroidered with golden flowers andcarryingawhite magneticrod.Movingaround thecontainer, hewould stroke and soothe thepatientsuntil calm was restored. Many women would later attribute thestrange powerhehad onthem tohis piercing look, which, they thought,wasexcitingorquieting themagnetic fluids intheir bodies. Within months ofhisarrival inParis, Mesmer became therage.His supportersincluded Marie—Antoinette herself, thequeenofFrance, wife of Louis XVI. AsinVienna, hewas condemned bytheofficial faculty ofmed- icine, butitdid not matter. Hisgrowing followingofpupilsand patients paidhimhandsomely. Mesmer expandedhistheories toproclaimthat allhumanity could be broughtintoharmony through thepowerofmagnetism,aconceptwith much appeal duringtheFrench Revolution. Acult ofMesrnerism spread across thecountry;inmany towns, “Societies ofHarmony” sprang upto experiment with magnetism. These societies eventuallybecame notorious: Theytended tobeledbylibertines who would turn their sessions into a kind ofgroup orgy. Attheheight ofMesmer‘s popularity,aFrench commission published areportbased onyears oftesting thetheoryofanimal magnetism.The conclusion: Magneu'sm’seffects onthebody actuallycame from akind of group hysteriaandautosuggestion.The reportwas well documented, and mined Mesmer’s reputationinFrance. Heleftthecountryand went into retirement. Onlyafewyears later, however, imitatorssprang upallover Europeand thecultofMesmerism spreadonce again,itsbelievers more numerous than ever. Interpretation Mesmer’s career can bebroken into two parts.When still inVienna, he clearly believed inthevalidityofhistheory,and didallhecould toprove it.But hisgrowingfrustration and thedisapprovalofhiscolleaguesmade himadoptanotherstrategy.First hemoved toParis, where no one knew him, and where hisextravagant theories found amore fruitful soil. Then he appealedtotheFrench love oftheater andspectacle, making hisapartment into akind ofmagical world inwhich asensoryoverload ofsmells, sights, and sounds entranced his customers. Most important,from now onhe practicedhismagnetism onlyon agroup.Thegroup providedthesetting inwhich themagnetism would have itsproper effect, onebeliever infecting theother, overwhelming anyindividual doubter. Mesmer thuspassedfrom beingaconfirmed advocate ofmagnetism tntherole ofacharlatan using every trick inthebook tocaptivate thepub- lie.Thebiggesttrick ofallwas toplayontherepressed sexualitythat bub- blesunder thesurface ofanygroup setting.Inagroup,alonging forsocial unity,alongingolder than civilization, cries outtobeawakened. This de~ siremaybesubsumed under aunifying cause, butbeneath itisarepressed sexualitythat thecharlatan knows how toexploitandmanipulate forhis ownpurposes. This isthelesson that Mesmer teaches us:Ourtendencytodoubt, the distance that allows ustoreason, isbroken down when wejoinagroup. Thewarmth and infectiousness ofthegroupoverwhelm theskepticalindi- vidual. This isthepower yougain bycreatingacult. Also, byplayingon people’s repressed sexuality, you lead them into mistaking their excited feelingsforsigns ofyour mystical strength.
