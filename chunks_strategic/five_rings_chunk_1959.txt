"But, Isuppose, ifhewere intruth aknower ofthese things that healsoimitates, hewould befarmore serious about thedeeds than the imitations andwould trytoleavemany fairdeeds behind asmemorials ofhimself andwould bemore eager tobetheonewho islauded rather thantheonewholauds." "Isuppose so,"hesaid."For thehonor andthebenefit coming fromthetwoarehardly equal." "Well, then, about theother things, let'snotdemand anaccount cfromHomer oranyother ofthepoets byasking, ifanyoneofthem was adoctor andnotonlyanimitator ofmedical speeches, whoarethemen whom anypoet, oldornew, issaid tohavemade healthy, asAsclepius did;orwhat students ofmedicine heleftbehind asAsclepius didhis ofiFspring.^ Nor, again, willweaskthem about theother arts, but we'll letthat go.Butabout thegreatest and fairest things ofwhich Homer attempts tospeak—about wars andcommands ofarmies and dgovernances ofcities, andabout theeducation ofahuman being—it issurely just toaskhimandinquire, 'Dear Homer, ifyouarenot third from thetruth about virtue, acraftsman ofaphantom, just the onewedefined asanimitator, butarealsosecond andable torecog- nizewhat sorts ofpractices makehuman beings better orworse in private and inpublic, telluswhich ofthecities wasbetter governed thanks toyou, asLacedaemon wasthanks toLycurgus, andmany e others, both great and small, were thanks tomany others?

"Idon't suppose so," saidGlaucon. "At least, theHomeridae themselves donottellofany." "Well, isanywar inHomer's timeremembered thatwaswell 600a fought with hisruling oradvice?" "None." "Well, then, asisappropriate tothedeeds ofawiseman,dothey tellofmany ingenious devices forthe arts oranyother activities, justasforThales theMilesian orAnacharsis theScythian?"^ "Not atall;there's nothing ofthesort." [282] BookXI599a-601a socrates/glaucon "Well, then, ifthere isnothing inpublic, isittold thatHomer, 600a while hewashimself alive, was inprivate aleader ineducation for certain menwhocherished him forhisintercourse andhanded down acertain Homeric way oflifetothosewhocame after, just asPy- b thagoras himself was particularly cherished forthisreason, and his successors evennow stillgivePythagoras' name toawayoflifethat makes themseemsomehow outstanding among men." "Again," hesaid, "nothing ofthesort issaid.ForCreophylos, Homer's comrade, would, Socrates, perhaps turn out tobeeven more ridiculous inhiseducation than inhisname,^ ifthethings saidaboutHomer aretrue.For itistoldthatHomer suffered consid- erable neglect inhisownday,when hewas alive." c "Yes, that istold," Isaid. "But, Glaucon, ifHomer were really able toeducate human beings andmake them better because heisin these things capable notofimitating butofknowing, doyousuppose thathewouldn't havemademany comrades andbeen honored and cherished bythem? ButProtagoras, theAbderite, after all,andProt dicus, theCean,^ andverymany others areable, byprivate in- tercourse, toimpress upon themenoftheirtimetheassurance thatthey willbeable togovern neither home norcityunless theythemselves d supervise their education, andthey aresointensely loved forthis wisdom that their comrades doeverything butcarry them about on their heads. Then doyousuppose that ifhewere able tohelphuman beings toward virtue, themen inHomer's timewould have lethimor Hesiod goaround being rhapsodes andwouldn't have clung tothem rather than totheir gold?Andwouldn't theyhave compelled these teachers tostaywiththem athome; or,ifthey weren't persuaded, e wouldn't theythemselves have attended^ them wherever theywent, until theyhadgained anadequate education?" "Inmyopinion, Socrates," hesaid, "what yousay isentirely true." "Shouldn't wesetdown allthose skilled inmaking, beginning withHomer, asimitators ofphantoms ofvirtue andoftheother sub- jects oftheirmaking? They don't layhold ofthetruth; rather, aswe were justnow saying, thepainter wdllmake what seems tobea shoemaker tothosewhounderstand aslittle about shoemaking ashe 601a understands, butwhoobserve only colors andshapes." "Most certainly." "Then, inthisway, Isuppose we'll claim thepoetic man also usesnames andphrases tocolor each ofthe arts.Hehimself doesn't understand; butheimitates insuch away astoseem, tomenwhose condition islike hisownandwhoobserve only speeches, tospeak very
