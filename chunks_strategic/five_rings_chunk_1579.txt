JoeFurey,aleader of thering,wasworking hiswaythrough Texas, making hundreds ofthou- sands ofdollars with classic congames. InFort Worth, hemet asucker named j.Frank Norileet, acattleman who owned alargeranch. Nortleet fellforthe con. Convinced oftheriches tocome, heemptiedhisbank ac» count of$45,000 and handed itover toFureyand hisConfederates. Afew dayslater they gave him his“millions,” which turned outtobeafewgood dollars wrappedaround apacket ofnewspaper clippings. Fureyand hismen had worked such cons ahundred times before, and thesucker wasusuallysoembarrassed byhisgullibilitythat hequietly learned hislesson andacceptedthe loss. But Norfleet was notlike other suckers. Hewent tothepolice,who told him there waslittlethey could do. “Then I’llgoafter those people myselfl”Norfleet told thedetectives. “I’ll getthem, too,ifittakes therestofmylife.” Hiswife took over theranch as Norileet scoured thecountry, looking forothers who had been fleeced in the same game.One such sucker came forward, and thetwo men identified one ofthe con artists inSanFrancisco, andmanaged togethim lockedup, The man committed suicide rather than face along term inprison. Norfleet kept going. Hetracked down another ofthe con artists in Montana, ropedhim like acalf, anddragged himthrough themuddystreets tothetown jail.Hetraveled notonlyacross thecountry but toEngland, Canada, and Mexico inSearch ofjoe Furey,and alsoofFurey’s right-hand man, WB.Spencer. Finding SpencerinMontreal, Norfleet chased him through the streets. Spencer escaped but therancher stayedonhistrail and caught upwith him inSalt Lake City. Preferring themercy ofthelaw to Nortleet’s wrath, Spencer turned himself in.= Norfleet found FureyinJacksonville, Florida, andpersonallyhauled him offtofacejustice inTexas. But hewouldn’t stopthere: Hecontinued ontoDenver, determined tobreakuptheentire ring. Spendingnotonly largesums ofmoney butanother yearofhislifeinthepursuit, hemanaged toputallofthe conn'ng’s leaders behind bars. Even some hedidn’t catch hadgrownsoterrified ofhim thattheytooturned themselves in. After fiveyearsofhunting, Norfleet hadsingle-handedly destroyedthe country’s largest confederation ofcon artists. The efiort bankrupted him andmined hismarriage,buthedied asatisfied man. Interpretation Most men accept thehumiliation ofbeing conned with asense ofresigna- tion.Theylearn their lesson, recognizingthat there isnosuch thingasa freelunch, and thattheyhave usuallybeen brought down bytheir own greedforeasy money. Some, however, refuse totake their medicine. In stead ofreflectingontheir owngullibilityand avarice, theyseethemselves astotallyinnocent victims. Men like thismayseem tobecrusaders forjusticeandhonesty,but theyareactually immoderatelyinsecure. Being fooled, being conned, has activated their self-doubt, andtheyaredesperatetorepairthedamage. Were themortgageonN0rfleet’s ranch, thecollapse ofhismarriage,and theyearsofborrowing money andlivingincheaphotels worth hisrevenge over hisembarrassment atbeing fleeced? TotheNorfleets oftheworld, overcoming their embarrassment isworthanyprice. Allpeoplehave insecurities, and often thebestwaytodeceive asucker istoplay upon hisinsecurities.

Helived modestly——even, sometimes, inpoverty—waiting forthetime when hecould return home and resume hisprincelylife. Once hewaspassing through the state ofCheng, where theruler, notknowing who hewas, treated himrudely.The r1.1ler’s minis- ter,ShuChan, saw this and said, “This man isaworthy prince. MayYour Highnesstreat him with great courtesyandthereby place him under an obligation!” But theruler, able toseeonly theprince’s lowly station, ig- nored thisadvice and insulted theprince again. Shu Chan again warned hismaster, saying, “IfYour Highnesscannot treat Ch’ung~erhwith cour- tesy, youshould puthim todeath, toavoid calamityinthefuture.” The ruleronly scoffed. Years later, theprincewasfinallyable toreturn home, hiscircum- stances greatly changed. Hedidnotforgetwho had been kind tohim, and LAW 19
