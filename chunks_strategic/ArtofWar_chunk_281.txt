is imperative to see whether or not their intention is genuine. Observe them and keep on guard at all times. Give your commanders strict directions to keep the troops in a state of readiness. Then you will prevail. The rule is �Accept a surrender as you would take on an opponent� (�Book of the Latter Han Dynasty�). In 197, the warlord Cao Cao attacked one of his rivals, who surrendered to him. After that, however, the conquered rival attacked Cao Cao out of spite, killing Cao Cao�s nephew and eldest son. Cao Cao himself was struck by a stray arrow during the assault. Now Cao Cao moved his troops. His rival came with a cavalry to raid Cao Cao�s army, but Cao Cao beat him back. Finally this rival ran away to join another warlord. Cao Cao said to his commanders, �When I overcame this rival of mine, my mistake was not to take hostages right away. See what has happened as a result and do not make the same mistake again.� Hardship Liu Ji said: Essential to generalship is to share the pleasures and pains of the troops.

The garrison chief is not to fight.� Most of the Wei troop leaders were in doubt about these instructions, but one of the top commanders said, �With Cao Cao away on an expedition, the enemy is certain to beat us. This is why Cao Cao left those instructions. If we strike back at the Wu troops before they close in on us, breaking the force of their momentum, then we can calm the minds of our troops. Once that is accomplished, we can hold the citadel. The potential for victory or defeat is in this one action�how can any of you doubt it?� That night the Wei commander called for volunteers to go with him. Eight hundred soldiers came forward. He killed
