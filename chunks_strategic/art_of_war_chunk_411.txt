and Napoleonic in the scale of his operations, he was especially famed for the marvelous rapidity of his marches, which has found expression in the line "Talk of Ts�ao Ts�ao, and Ts�ao Ts�ao will appear." Ou- yang Hsiu says of him that he was a great captain who "measured his strength against Tung Cho, Lu Pu and the two Yuan, father and son, and vanquished 37See my "Catalogue of Chinese Books" (Luzac & Co., 1908), no. 40. 38This is a discussion of 29 difficult passages in Sun Tzu. CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 18 them all; whereupon he divided the Empire of Han with Wu and Shu, and made himself king. It is recorded that whenever a council of war was held by Wei on the eve of a far-reaching campaign, he had all his calculations ready; those generals who made use of them did not lose one battle in ten; those who ran counter to them in any particular saw their armies incontinently beaten and put to flight." Ts�ao Kung�s notes on Sun Tzu, models of austere brevity, are so thoroughly characteristic of the stern commander known to history, that it is hard indeed to conceive of them as the work of a mere LITTERATEUR. Sometimes, indeed, owing to extreme compression, they are scarcely intelligible and stand no less in need of a commentary than the text itself.39 2. MENG SHIH. The commentary which has come down to us under this name is comparatively meager, and nothing about the author is known. Even his per- sonal name has not been recorded. Chi T�ien-pao�s edition places him after Chia Lin,and Ch�ao Kung- wu also assigns him to the T�ang dynasty,40 but this is a mistake. In Sun Hsing-yen�s preface, he appears as Meng Shih of the Liang dyn- asty [502-557]. Others would identify him with Meng K�ang of the 3rd century. He is named in one work as the last of the "Five Commentators," the others being Wei Wu Ti, Tu Mu, Ch�en Hao and Chia Lin. 3. LI CH�UAN of the 8th century was a well-known writer on military tactics. One of his works has been in constant use down to the present day. The T�UNG CHIH mentions "Lives of famous generals from the Chou to the T�ang dynasty" as written by him.41 According to Ch�ao Kung-wu and the T�IEN-I-KO catalogue, he followed a variant of the text of Sun Tzu which differs considerably from those now extant. His notes are mostly short and to the point, and he frequently illustrates his remarks by anecdotes from Chinese history. 4. TU YU (died 812) did not publish a separate commentary on Sun Tzu, his notes being taken from the T�UNG TIEN, the encyclopedic treatise on the Constitution which was his life- work. They are largely repetitions of Ts�ao Kung and Meng Shih, besides which it is believed that he drew on the ancient commentaries of Wang Ling and others. Owing to the peculiar arrangement of T�UNG TIEN, he has to explain each
