"And therefore, from thispoint ofview too,thehaving anddoing 434a ofone'sownandwhat belongs tooneself would beagreed tobejustice." "That's so." "Now see ifyouhave thesame opinion asIdo.Acarpenter's trying todothejobofashoemaker orashoemaker thatofacarpenter, ortheirexchanging tools orhonors withoneanother, oreven thesame man's trying todoboth, witheverything elsebeing changed along with it,inyour opinion, would thatdoanygreatharm tothecity?" "Hardly," hesaid. "But, Isuppose, when onewho isacraftsman orsome other kind b ofmoney-maker bynature, inflated bywealth, multitude, strength, or something elseofthekind, tries togetintothe class^i ofthewar- rior, oroneofthewarriors who's unworthy intothatoftheadviser and guardian, andthesemenexchange tools andhonors withoneanother; [H2] BookIV/433c.435bsock.t.s/cx..con orwhen thesameman tries todoallthese things atonce— then Isup- 434b pose it'salsoyouropinion that thischange inthemandthismeddling arethedestruction ofthecity." "That's entirely certain." "Meddling among theclasses, ofwhich there arethree, and ex- change withoneanother isthegreatest harm forthecityandwould c most correctly becalled extreme evil-doing." "Quite certainly." "Won't yousaythatthegreatest evil-doing against one'sown city isinjustice?" "Ofcourse." "Then, that's injustice. Again, let'ssay itthisway.Theopposite ofthis— themoney-making, auxiliary, andguardian classes doing what's appropriate, each ofthemminding itsownbusiness inacity— would bejustice andwould make thecity just." "My opinion," hesaid, "isalsothatandnoother."^ "Let's notassert itsopositively just yet," Isaid. "But, ifthisform isapplied tohuman beings singly andalsoagreed byustobejustice there, then we'llconcede it.What elsewilltherebeforustosay?And ifnot,then we'll consider something else.Now let'scomplete thecon- sideration bymeans ofwhichwethought that, ifweshould attempt to seejustice first insome bigger thing thatpossessed it,wewould more easily catch sight ofwhat it'slike inoneman.And itwasouropinion that thisbigger thing isacity; sowefounded oneasbestwecould, e knowing fullwell thatjustice would beinagoodoneatleast.

"Theway toproceed isasyou say," hesaid,"and itmust be done." "Then," Isaid, "isthatwhich onecalls thesame, whether it'sbig- gerorsmaller, unlike orlike inthatrespect inwhich it'scalled the same?" "Like," hesaid. "Then thejustman willnotbeany different from thejust city h with respect totheform itself ofjustice, butwillbelike it." "Yes," hesaid,"hewillbelike it." "But acityseemed tobejustwhen each ofthethree classes of [11,3 ] socrates/glaucon therepublic 435b natures present initminded itsownbusiness and, again, moderate courageous, andwisebecause ofcertain other affections andhabits of thesesame classes." "True," hesaid. "Then it'sinthisway,myfriend, that we'll claim thatthesingle cman—^with these same forms inhissoul—thanks tothesame affections asthose inthecity, rightly laysclaim tothesamenames." "Quite necessarily," hesaid. "Now it'saslight question about thesoulwe've stumbled upon, yousurprising man," Isaid. "Does ithave these three forms in it ornot?" "Inmyopinion, it'shardly aslight question," hesaid. "Perhaps, Socrates, thesaying thatfinethings arehard istrue." "Itlooks like it," Isaid. "Butknow well, Glaucon, that inmy d opinion, we'll never getaprecise grasp ofitonthebasis ofpro- cedures22 such aswe'renowusing intheargument.
