Most people operateinawhirlpool ofemotions, constantlyreact‘ ing,churning upsquabblesand conflicts. Your sell’—contIol andautonomy willonly bother and infuriate them.

Ontheother hand, you cannot completelystand aside, forthat would cause needless offense. Toplaythegame properly, you must seem inter- ested inother people‘s problems,even sometimes appeartotake their side. Butwhile you make outwardgesturesofsupport, you must maintainyour innerenergyandsanity bykeeping your emotions disengaged.Nomatter how hard people trytopull you in,never letyourinterest intheir affairs andpetty squabbles gobeyondthesurface. Give them gifts,listen with a sympathetic look, even occasionally play thecharmer-—but inwardly keep both thefriendly kingsand theperfidious Borgiasatarm’s length.

Inancient China, thekingdom ofChin once invaded the kingdom ofHsing. Huan, theruler ofanearby province, thought he should rush toHsing’s defense, but hisadviser counseled him towait: “Hsingisnotyetgoingtoruin,” hesaid, “and Chin isnotyetexhausted. If Chin isnotexhausted, [we] cannot becomeveryinfluential. Moreover, the merit ofsupportingastate indangerisnot asgreatasthevirtue ofreviving aruined one.” The adviser’s argumentwon theday,and ashehadpre- dicted, Huan later had theglory both ofrescuing Hsing from thebrink of destruction and then ofconqueringanexhausted Chin.

You canalso take thegameastepfurther, bypromising your support toboth sides inaconflict while maneuveringsothat the one tocome outahead in thestruggleisyou. This was whatCastn1ccio Castracani, ruler oftheItalian town ofLucca inthefourteenthcentury,didwhen hehaddesignsonthe town ofPistoia. Asiege would have been expensive, costingboth lives and money,butCastruccio knew that Pistoia contained tworival factions, the Blacks and theWhites, which hated one another.
