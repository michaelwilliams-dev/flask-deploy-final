Tofightaformidable foelike theJapanese,infact, would be theperfect trainingforthe Communists’ ragtag army.Mao’s planwas adopted,and itworked: Bythe time theJapanese finally retreated, the Communists hadgained thefighting experiencethathelpedthem defeat theNationalists. Years later, aJapanesevisitor tried toapologizetoMao forhis coun- try’sinvasion ofChina. Mao interrupted, “Should Inot thankyouin» stead?” Without aworthy opponent,heexplained,aman orgroupcannot grow stronger. Mao’s strategyofconstant conflict has several keycomponents. First, becertain that inthelongrunyou willemergevictorious. Never picka fight with someone youare not sure youcan defeat, asMao knew the Japanesewould bedefeated intime. Second, ifyouhave noapparentene- mies, youmust sometimes setupaconvenient target,even turningafriend into anenemy.Mao used this tactic time andagaininpolitics. Third, use such enemies todefine yourcause more clearly tothepublic,even framing itasastruggle ofgood againstevil. Mao actually encouragedChi.na’s dis agreements with theSoviet Union and theUnited States; without clear-cut enemies, hebelieved, hispeople would loseanysense ofwhat Chinese Communism meant Asharplydefined enemy isafarstronger argument foryourside than allthewordsyou could possibly puttogether.

(BaltasarGraciz'1n, 16 0 1—16 58) REVE RSA L Althoughitisgenerallybest not tomix work with friendship, there are times when afriend can beused togreatereffect than anenemy. Aman of power,forexample,often hasdirty work that has tobedone, butforthe sake ofappearances itisgenerally preferabletohave other peopledoitfor him; friends often dothisthebest, since their afiection forhim makes them willingtotake chances. Also, ifyour plans goawryfor some reason, you can use afriend asaconvenient scapegoat.This “fall ofthefavorite” was a trick often used bykingsandsovereigns: Theywould lettheir closest friend atcourt take thefallfor amistake, since thepublic would notbelieve that theywould deliberately sacrifice afriend forsuch apurpose. Ofcourse, afteryouplaythatcard, youhave lostyourfriend forever. Itisbest, then, to reserve thescapegoat role for someone who isclose toyou but not too close. Finally,theproblemabout working with friends isthat itconfuses the boundaries and distances thatworking requires.Butifboth partnersinthe arrangement understand thedangers involved, afriend often can beem- ployedtogreat effect. You must never letyour guard down insuch aven- ture, however; alwaysbe onthe lookout forany signs ofemotional disturbance such asenvyandingratitude. Nothingisstable intherealm of power,and even theclosest offriends canbetransformed into theworst of enernies.
