mention vulgar plebeians and hireling ruffians such as Ying K�ao-shu,17 Ts�ao Kuei,18, Chu Chih-wu and Chuan She-chu19. In the case of Sun Wu, whose fame and achievements were so brilliant, the omission is much more glaring. Again, details are given, in their due order, about his con- temporaries Wu Yuan and the Minister P�ei.20 Is it credible that Sun Wu alone should have been passed over? In point of literary style, Sun Tzu�s work belongs to the same school as KUAN TZU,21 LIU T�AO,22 and the YUEH YU23 and may have been the production of some private scholar living towards the end of the "Spring the case of very short works, one is tempted to think that P�IEN might simply mean "leaves." 16Yeh Shih of the Sung dynasty [1151-1223]. 17He hardly deserves to be bracketed with assassins. 18See Chapter 7, ss. 27 and Chapter 11, ss. 28. 19See Chapter 11, ss. 28.

Why that chapter should be singled out, however, is not clear. CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 11 and Autumn" or the beginning of the "Warring States" period.24 The story that his precepts were actually applied by the Wu State, is merely the out- come of big talk on the part of his followers. From the flourishing period of the Chou dynasty25 down to the time of the "Spring and Autumn," all military commanders were statesmen as well, and the class of professional generals, for conducting external campaigns, did not then exist. It was not until the period of the "Six States"26 that this custom changed. Now although Wu was an uncivilized State, it is conceivable that Tso should have left unrecorded the fact that Sun Wu was a great general and yet held no civil office? What we are told, therefore, about Jang-chu 27 and Sun Wu, is not authentic matter, but the reckless fabrication of theorizing pundits. The story of Ho Lu�s experiment on the women, in particular, is utterly preposterous and incredible. Yeh Shui-hsin represents Ssu-ma Ch�ien as having said that Sun Wu crushed Ch�u and entered Ying. This is not quite correct. No doubt the impression left on the reader�s mind is that he at least shared in these exploits. The fact may or may not be significant; but it is nowhere explicitly stated in the SHIH CHI either that Sun Tzu was general on the occasion of the taking of Ying, or that he even went there at all. Moreover, as we know that Wu Yuan and Po P�ei both took part in the expedition, and also that its success was largely due to the dash and enterprise of Fu Kai, Ho Lu�s younger brother, it is not
