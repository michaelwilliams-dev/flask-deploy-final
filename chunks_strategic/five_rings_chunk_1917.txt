"Doyouwant toseeugly things, blind andcrooked, when it's d possible tohear bright and faironesfrom others?" "No, inthename ofZeus, Socrates," saidGlaucon. "You're not going towithdraw when youare,asitwere, attheend. Itwill satisfy us even ifyougothrough thegood justasyouwentthrough justice, mod- eration andtherest." "Itwillquite satisfymetoo,mycomrade," Isaid."But Ifear I'll notbeuptoit,andinmyeagerness I'llcutagraceless figure andhave topaythepenalty bysuffering ridicule.

"Well beascareful aswepossibly can,"hesaid. "Just speak." "Yes," Isaid, "assoon asI'vecome toanagreement and re- minded youofthethings stated here earlier andalready often repeated onother occasions." "What arethey?" hesaid. b "Weboth assert thatthere are," Isaid,"and distinguish inspeech, many fairthings, many good things, andsoonforeachkindofthing." "Yes, sowedo." "Andwealso assert thatthere isafair itself, agood itself, andso onforallthethings thatwethen setdown asmany. Now, again,we referthem tooneideaofeach asthough theideawere one;andwead- dress itasthatwhich really is." That sso. "And, moreover, wesaythat theformer areseenbutnot in- tellected, while theideas areintellected butnotseen." "That's entirely certain." "With what partofourselves doweseethethings seen?" c "With thesight," hesaid. "Isn't itwith hearing," Isaid, "thatwehear thethings heard, and with theother senses thatwesense allthat issensed?" "Ofcourse." "Have you," Isaid, "reflected onhow lavish thecraftsman ofthe senses wasinthefabrication ofthepower ofseeing andbeing seen?" "Notverymuch," hesaid. "Well consider itinthisway. Isthere aneed foranother class of thing inaddition tohearing andsound inorder thattheonehearand theotherbeheard—athird thing intheabsence ofwhich theonewon't d hearandtheother won't beheard?" "No," hesaid. "Isuppose," Isaid, "that there arenotmany other things, notto saynone, thatneed anything ofthekind.Orcanyou tellofany?" "Not I,"hesaid. "Don't younotice thatthepower ofseeing andwhat's seendo have such aneed?" "How?" "Surely, when sight isintheeyesandtheman possessing them tries tomake useofit,andcolor ispresent inwhat istobeseen, inthe absence ofathird class ofthingwhose nature isspecifically directed to [187 ] socrates/glaucon the REPUBLlfti 507e thisverypurpose, youknow thatthesight willseenothing andthecol orswillbeunseen." "What class ofthing areyouspeaking of?"hesaid. "It's thatwhich you call light "Isaid. "What yousay istrue," hesaid. "Then thesense ofsight andthepower ofbeing seenare yoked together with ayoke that,bythemeasure ofanideabyno 508a means insignificant, ismore honorable than theyokes unitingother teams, iflight isnotwithout honor." "But, ofcourse," hesaid, "it's farfrom being without honor." "Which ofthegods inheaven canyoupoint toasthelord respon- sible forthis,whose lightmakes oursight seeinthefinestwayandthe seen things seen?" "The veryoneyouandtheothers would alsopoint to,"hesaid.

"And thesun isn't sight either, isit,butasitscause isseenby sight itself?" "That's so,"hesaid. "Well, then," Isaid, "say thatthesun istheoffspring ofthegood Imean— anoffspring thegood begot inaproportion with itself: asthe c good isintheintelligible region withrespect tointelligence andwhat is intellected, sothesun isinthevisible region with respect tosight and what isseen."
