sympa- thyorrespect. Makingashow ofone’s weakness isactuallyaveryeffective strategy,subtle anddeceptive,inthegame ofpower (see Law 22,the Sur— render Tactic). Another strategyofthesupposed nonplayeristodemand equalityin everyarea oflife.Everyonemust betreated alike, whatever their status and strength.But toavoid thetaint ofpower, youattempttotreateveryone equallyandfairly, youwill confront theproblemthat some peopledocer- tainthingsbetter than others. Treating everyone equallymeans ignoring their differences, elevatingthe less skillful and suppressingthose who excel. Again, manyofthose who behave thiswayareactually deploying another power strategy, redistributing people’s rewards inawaythatthey determine. Yetanotherwayofavoidingthegame would beperfect honestyand straightforwardness, since one ofthemaintechniques ofthose who seek powerisdeceit andsecrecy.Butbeing perfectlyhonest willinevitably hurt and insult agreat many people,some ofwhom will choose toinjure youin return. No onewill seeyourhonest statement ascompletely objectiveand free ofsome personalmotivation. And they willberight: Intruth, the use ofhonestyisindeed apower strategy,intended toconvince peopleofone’s noble, goodehearted,selfless character. Itisaform ofpersuasion,even a subtle form ofcoercion. Finally,those who claim tobenonplayers mayaffect anairofnaiveté, toprotectthem from the accusation thattheyare afterpower.Beware again, however, fortheappearanceofnaiveté canbeaneffective means of deceit (see Law 21,Seem Dumber Than Your Mark). And even genuine naiveté isnotfree ofthe snares ofpower.Children maybenaive inmany ways, butthey often actfrom anelemental need togaincontrol over those around them. Children suffer greatlyfrom feeling powerlessintheadult world, andtheyuseanymeans available togettheir way. Genuinelyinno- centpeople maystillbeplayingforpower,and areoften horribly effective atthegame,since theyarenothindered byreflection. Once again, those who make ashow ordisplay ofinnocence aretheleast innocent ofall. You canrecognizethese supposed nonplayers bythewaythey flaunt their moral qualities,their piety,theirexquisitesense ofjustice. But since allofushungerforpower, and almost allofour actions areaimed atgain- ingit,thenonplayersaremerely throwing dust inoureyes, distractingus from theirpower plays with their airofmoral superiority.Ifyouobserve them closely, youwill seeinfactthattheyareoften the ones most skillful at indirect manipuiation,even ifsome ofthem practice itunconsciously.And theygreatlyresent anypublicizing ofthetactics theyuseevery day. Iftheworld islike agiant scheming court and we aretrapped inside it, there isno useintryingtooptoutofthegame.That willonlyrenderyou powerless,and powerlessness will make you miserable. Instead ofstrug- gling againsttheinevitable, instead ofarguingandwhiningandfeeling guilty,itisfarbetter toexcel atpower. Infact, thebetter youare atdealing with power,thebetter friend, lover, husband, wife, and person you be come. Byfollowingtheroute oftheperfect courtier (see Law 24)you learn tomake others feelbetter about themselves, becomingasource ofpleasure tothem.

Bymasteringthe48laws inthisbook, you spareothers thepain that comes from bungling with power—~by playingwith firewithout know- ingitsproperties. Ifthegameofpowerisinescapable,better tobeanartist than 2.denier orabungler. Learningthegame ofpower requiresacertain wayoflookingattheworld, ashifting ofperspective. Ittakes effort andyears ofpractice,formuch of thegame maynot come naturally. Certain basic skills arerequired, and onceyoumaster these skillsyouwill beable toapply thelaws ofpower more easily. The most important ofthese skills, andpower’scrucial foundation, is theability tomaster your emotions. Anemotional responsetoa.situation is thesingle greatestbarrier topower,amistake thatwill cost youalotmore than anytemporary satisfactionyoumight gain byexpressing yourfeel- ings. Emotions cloud reason, andifyoucannot seethesituation clearly, youcannot prepareforandrespondtoitwith anydegree ofcontrol. Angeristhe most destructive ofemotional responses,foritclouds yourvision themost. Italso has arippleeffect thatinvariably makes situa- tions lesscontrollable andheightens your enemy’sresolve.
