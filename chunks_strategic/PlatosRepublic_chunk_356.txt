the nonphilosophic and hostile background from which it emerged. It is not merely historical curiosity which should lead us to make this effort. We must rediscover the forgotten reasons for Socrates' difficulties in order to evaluate the role of philosophy and science within our world, for their role may be more problematic than we are wont to believe. Philosophy is a rare plant, one which has flourished only in the West; it is perhaps the essence of that West. Its place is not simply assured everywhere and always as is the city's. The writings of Plato anrl "'� few others made it respectable. The Republic thus represents one of the most decisive moments of our history. In this work Socrates presents the grounds of his being brought to trial and shows why philosophy is always in danger and always in need of a defense. The best way to see the fantastic character of Socrates' proposal for the rule of philosopher-kings is to look at Aristophanes' Clouds, which shows how the philosopher appears to the city. Socrates stays in his think-tank discussing the nature of the heavens with unhealthy men. He is graceless and unprepossessing, a ridiculous personage in the eyes of any man of the world. His experiments in natural philosophy allow him to be besmirched by lizards, and he spends his time looking at gnats, a thing no gentleman would do; these insects even infest his clothes. He does not believe in the gods of Athens and has other ex? traordinary divinities of his own; he draws promising young men away from the political life into his unusual researches. He is a marginal figure who seems both odd and corrupt, utterly without common sense. With this picture of himself in mind, Socrates seems to say here, "All right, this is the man who should rule/' He is ridiculous in his pretensions and subversive in his intentions, thus provoking reactions oflaughter and anger. At this point in the discussion, Socrates argues that philosophy is needed in this city; he does not argue that philosophy is the best human activity. Philosophy is not the theme of the discussion, but justice, and� particularly a just city. Nevertheless, the most comprehensive discus? sion of the city leads-against the will of Socrates, as it were-to a discussion of philosophy. Beginning from the common sense of political men and maintaining their perspective throughout, Socrates demonstrates that they must tolerate and encourage philosophy. This constitutes a defense of philosophy from the political point of view. Philosophy is necessary to this regime, to the best regime, because without philosophy the r"egime cannot find impartial rulers who have considered the proper distribution of the good things. In other words, the philosopher is the only kind of knower whose attention is devoted to the whole. Statesmen are always preoccupied with the here-and-now, but the interpretation of the here-and-now depends on some knowledge of the whole. If justice means giving each man what is fitting for him, a statesman must
