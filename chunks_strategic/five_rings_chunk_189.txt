You are an observer of the human comedy, and by beingas tolerant as possible, you gain a much greater ability to understand people andto influence their behavior when necessary.With this new awareness and attitude in place, you can begin to advance inyour apprenticeship in social intelligence. This intelligence consists of twocomponents, both equally important to master. First, there is what we shall callspecific knowledge of human nature—namely the ability to read people, to get afeel for how they see the world, and to understand their individuality. Second,there is the general knowledge of human nature, which means accumulating anunderstanding of the overall patterns of human behavior that transcend us as individuals, including some of the darker qualities we often disregard. Becausewe are all a mix of unique qualities and traits common to our species, only thepossession of both forms of knowledge can give you a complete picture of thepeople around you. Practice both forms of knowledge and they will yieldinvaluable skills that are essential in the quest for mastery.Specific Knowledge—Reading PeopleMost of us have had the sensation at some point in our lives of experiencing anuncanny connection with another person. In such moments we have anunderstanding that is hard to put into words; we even feel that we can anticipatethe thoughts of the other person. Such communication generally occurs withclose friends and partners, people whom we trust and feel attuned to on manylevels. Because we trust them, we open up to their influence and vice versa. Inour normal state we are often nervous, defensive, and self-absorbed, and ourminds are turned inward. But in these moments of connection, the internalmonologue is shut off, and we pick up more cues and signals from the otherperson than usual.What this means is that when we are not inward-directed but attending moredeeply to another person, we gain access to forms of communication that arelargely nonverbal in nature, and quite effective in their own way. We canimagine that our primitive ancestors, needing to cooperate on a high level yet notexperiencing the kind of interior monologue that comes with words, possessedan incredibly powerful sensitivity to the moods and feelings of others within thegroup, bordering on telepathy. This would be similar to what other socialanimals possess, but in this case this sensitivity would have been heightened byour ancestor’s ability to place themselves in the minds of others.The intense nonverbal connection we experience with those we are close tois clearly not appropriate in a work environment, but to the degree we openourselves up and direct our attention outward to other people, we can access apart of the sensitivity that our ancestors had, and become much more effective atreading people.To begin this process, you need to train yourself to pay less attention to thewords that people say and greater attention to their tone of voice, the look intheir eye, their body language—all signals that might reveal a nervousness orexcitement that is not expressed verbally. If you can get people to becomeemotional, they will reveal a lot more. Cutting off your interior
