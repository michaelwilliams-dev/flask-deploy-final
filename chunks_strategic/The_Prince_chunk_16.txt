place troops there. Colonists don't cost much; one can send them and keep them there without expense. The only people it of.fends are those whose fields and houses are confiscated, and they THE PRINCE � 35 are only a small part of the estate. Those who are hurt by this, be.ing homeless and poor, are not likely to make much trouble. The rest of the populace is unharmed, and should remain quiet, or be.come afraid to make trouble lest they become victims of the spoils like the others. Therefore, colonies cost less, remain loyal, and make less trouble. The victims can't make trouble because they are poor and dispossessed. Note that you have to be either soft or harsh, because men take offense easily at small insults, but they can't react against harsh measures. When you offend some one, be sure they are incapable of revenge. By placing troops there, the cost is much more and much more goes into the surveil.lance of all the renegade elements of the state so that its acquisi.tion becomes a losing proposition. Troops offend many more people what with housing and requisition, which harms every.body. Everybody becomes the enemy and they can do harm be.cause, though conquered, they remain at home. Occupation is therefore unproductive while colonization is useful. Whoever is in such a province has to make themselves Prince and defender of nearby dependent territories and see to weaken.ing the leaders of them and guard against any strong foreigner en.tering them. Someone like this will always be promoted by the discontents because of ambition or fear � as we saw when the Aetolians sent Roman troops to Greece and in every other prov.ince they entered. It is a fact of life that as soon as a powerful foreigner enters a province all those who are weaker flock to his side motivated by envy of the chief put over them. So, in regard to lesser lords, a new Prince has no trouble lining them up be.cause they all swear solidarity with the new state he has acquired. He just has to be careful they don't take too much power and au.thority. With his own power and their favor he can easily set back those who are ambitious and thereby he can hold sway in all things in the province. If he does not govern well though he will soon lose dominion in what he has acquired � and while he is in power � he will have nothing but trouble. The Romans, in provinces they conquered, observed these rules well. They colonized, engaged the weaker leaders, without 36� Niccol� Machiavelli not to is making them stronger, put down the stronger ones, and did allow powerful foreigners gain sway. Greece an example. The Romans supported the Acheans and the Aetolians and set back the Macedonians. They exiled Antiochus. They never let the Acheans or the Aetolians expand their states. They never let to Philip's entreaties persuade them any friendship without put.ting him down. They did
