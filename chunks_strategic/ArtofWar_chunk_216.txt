when persons are chosen for offices, there is order.� The proliferation of titles, offices, and emoluments to satisfy members of powerful and well-connected clans and interest groups was always one of the banes of Chinese government and religion, increasing the burdens on the taxpayers while hastening sclerosis in practical administration. Taoist philosophers said that this can happen in any domain of organized activity, of which national government is a highly visible and consequential example. Zhuge Liang emphatically stressed the idea that government should be streamlined, in accord with Taoist political theory, much of which is particularly designed for use in times of conflict and duress. The third element of the hexagram for �The Army� symbolizes the secondary leaders within the army. The reading emphasizes the special importance of mutual understanding and order in the relationships on this level, as well as in relationships between this level of the chain of command and the central military leadership. This is also on the analogy of the subordination of the whole martial entity to the whole cultural entity. The I Ching�s statement on the third element says, �It bodes ill for the army to have many bosses.� Discord and competition in the lower ranks of command naturally weaken the whole body, especially by damaging and distorting the connection between the leadership and the common soldiery. Cheng Yi interprets, �The responsibility for a military expedition should be unified; one in a position of authority should concentrate on this.� This also applies, like other I Ching metaphors, to other domains; in this case to the negative effects of extreme division and disunity on analogous levels of organization, from the organization of an individual life to the organization of a collective enterprise. The Art of War also makes a point of the vulnerability inherent in disunity and directs its strategy at this weakness: in the chapter �Nine Grounds,� Master Sun the Martialist says, �Those who are called the good militarists of old could make opponents lose contact between front and back lines, lose reliability between large and small groups, lose mutual concern for the welfare of the different social classes among them, lose mutual accommodation between the rulers and the ruled, lose enlistments among the soldiers, lose coherence within the armies.� This is the familiar rule of �divide and conquer,� amplifying the I Ching rule and carrying it into each dimension of an organization. The fourth element of the hexagram for �The Army� represents being in a weak position and at a disadvantage in times of conflict. The statement says, �The army camps; no blame,� meaning that it is normal to hold back or withdraw from an impossible position. Identical strategic principles are emphasized several times in The Art of War, as in the chapter on �Armed Struggle,� which says, �Avoiding confrontation with orderly ranks and not attacking great formations is mastering adaptation.� In the chapter on �Nine Grounds,� it also says that good militarists of yore �went into action when it was advantageous, stopped when
