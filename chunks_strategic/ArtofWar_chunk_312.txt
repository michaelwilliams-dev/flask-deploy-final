flee; one of the critical elements of good leadership is evoking and strengthening mutual trust and internal harmony among members of the group. �In what sense is the bow a rush of force? Shooting from between shoulder and arm, killing people a hundred paces away without their knowing where it is coming from�this is why the bow is said to be a rush of force.� A rush of force may be envisioned as a force of movement initiated or �launched� within a relatively small compass that goes on to exert a wide- ranging effect by the force of that initial momentum. In this sense it may be symbolized by the bow and arrow. �In what sense are boats and chariots adaptive changes? When high, � Boats rise and dip with the waves and the tide, chariots travel up and down hills and around curves. These symbolize adapting responsively to changes in circumstances in the course of progress. �In what sense are spears and halberds signal standards? . . . Signal standards are mostly flags by day and mostly drums by night, used as means of directing the battle.� Spears and halberds are models for signal banners because of their frontline position as well as their length and consequent visibility. Sound is used when visual signals are ineffective. Metaphorically, vanguard weaponry representing signal standards reflects the use of outstanding indicators�such as economic indices, technological developments, or progressive sociopolitical adaptations� to evaluate the state of a nation or community. �These four things are functions of weaponry. Everybody considers them useful, but no one knows the right way to use them. �Overall, there are four military sciences: battle formation, force, adaptation, and direction. Thorough understanding of these four is a means of destroying powerful enemies and capturing fierce commanders.� Battle formation represents the disposition and deployment of resources. Force represents the energy and momentum of an endeavor or a movement. Adaptation represents the capacity to respond effectively to changes. Direction represents the aim and guidance of energy and effort. [ 10 ] Military Conditions Master Sun said, �If you want to know the conditions of a military force, archery is an appropriate model. The arrows are the soldiers, the bow is the commander, and the archer is the ruler.� The arrows are the power, the bow concentrates and releases the momentum, while the archer takes aim. �An arrow is tipped with metal and fletched with feathers so that it will be sharp and fly straight If you organize soldiers so that the rear guard is heavy while the front is light, they may be orderly when arrayed in battle formation, but they will not obey when ordered to charge the enemy. This organization of soldiers is not in accord with the model of the arrow.� Insufficient force in the vanguard makes it impossible to open up enough of a gap in the resistance to allow a telling follow-through. �The commander is the bow: if the grip is not right when the bow is
