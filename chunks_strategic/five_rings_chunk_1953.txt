"Ofcourse." "And wouldn't heundergo allthisdue tobeing inexperienced in what istruly above, inthemiddle, andbelow?" "Plainly." "Then would youbesurprised' ifthosewho areinexperienced in truth, astheyhaveunhealthy opinions aboutmany other things, sotoothey aredisposed toward pleasure andpainandwhat's between them insuch away that,when they arebrought tothepainful, theysuppose trulyand 585a arereally inpain, but,when brought from thepainful tothe in- between, they seriously suppose they arenearing fulfillment and pleasure; and, asthough outoflackofexperience ofwhite theylooked from gray toblack, outoflackofexperience ofpleasure they lookfrom pain tothepainless andaredeceived?" "No,byZeus," hesaid, "Iwouldn't besurprised; I'dbefarmore soifthisweren't thecase." "Reflect on itthisway," Isaid. "Aren't hunger, thirst, andsuch things kinds ofemptiness ofthebody's condition?" b "Ofcourse." "Aren't ignorance andimprudence intheir turnemptiness ofthe soul's condition?" "Quite so." "And wouldn't themanwhopartakes ofnourishment andtheone who getsintelligence become full?" "Surely." "Astofullness, isthetruer fullness thatofathingwhich islessorofone which ismore." "Plainly thatofonewhich ismore." "Which oftheclasses doyoubelieve participates more inpure being: theclass offood, drink, seasoning, andnourishment ingeneral, ortheform oftrue opinion, knowledge, intelligence and, insum, ofall c virtue?

"That," hesaid,"which isconnected withwhat isalways thesame farexceeds." "And thebeing ofthatwhich isalways thesame, does itpar- ticipate inbeing anymore than inknowledge?"^ "Not atall."

"Most necessarily," hesaid. 586a "Therefore, thosewhohavenoexperience ofprudence andvirtue butarealways living with feasts andthelike are, itseems, brought dov^Ti andthenback again tothemiddle andthroughout lifewander in thisway; but,since they don't gobeyond this,they don't lookupward toward what istruly above, norarethey everbrought toit;andthey aren't filled withwhat really is,nordothey taste ofapleasure that is sureandpure; rather, after thefashion ofcattle, always looking down andwith theirheads bent toearthandtable, they feed, fattening them- b selves, andcopulating; and, forthesakeofgetting more ofthese things, theykickandbuttwithhorns andhoofs ofiron, killing each other be- cause they areinsatiable; forthey arenotfilling thepartofthemselves that is,orcancontain anything, with things that are."
