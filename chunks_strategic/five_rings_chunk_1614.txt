Thepublicwould readilybelieve inthe scapegoat’s guilt-—why would thekingsacrifice hisfavorite unless hewere guilty?And theother couxtiers, resendul ofthefavorite anyway, would re- joiceathisdownfall. Theking, meanwhile, would ridhimself ofaman who bythat time hadprobably learned toomuch about him, perhaps becoming arrogantand even disdainful ofhim.
