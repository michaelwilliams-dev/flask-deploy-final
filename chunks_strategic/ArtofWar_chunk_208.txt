people from the intellectual, religious, military, or aristocratic classes. Cheng Yi says, �It is because there is corresponding assistance from a higher level that people in this position are able to refrain from persisting in an affair,� since collaboration reduces conflict. According to interpretation based on ethical idealism, the second element of the hexagram represents ambitious strength contending against a just order. Because this is contention motivated by personal desire and not by moral necessity, it is countermanded in the I Ching�s statement: �Not pressing your contention, go back to escape in your hometown; then you will be free from fault.� Cheng Yi explains, �If you know that what is right and just is not to be opposed, and you go back home to live modestly, minding your own business, then you will be free from fault.� The third element of the �Contention� hexagram represents people who are pliable and weak in positions of relative strength. In the construction of a hexagram, the third position is strong insofar as it represents the highest place among the lower echelons. This corresponds to positions of subordinate authority, on more local and diffuse dimensions than the authority and power represented by the upper strata of the hexagram, which represent the higher and more concentrated levels of influence and leadership. In �Contention,� weakness at the top of the lower echelons is represented as characteristic of situations in which contention arises. The I Ching�s statement reads, �Living on past virtues, be steadfast.� What the text means by �past virtues� may be the labor of one, two, three, or more generations, generations of work forming the basis for the status of the present generation. From this point of view, to be steadfast (a stock I Ching term also meaning �chaste� and �true�) can mean being careful not to lose what progress has been made, even over generations. In the context of the theme of this sign, to be steadfast or chaste would imply that losing or despoiling �past virtues� by contending for what is as yet unearned is something to be positively avoided. In his interpretation, the idealist Cheng Yi gives a very specific understanding of what this line means to him in the context of one generation: �Living on past virtues,� he says, �means living on what one has earned according to one�s means.� �Being steadfast,� he continues, �means being firmly in control of oneself.� Again, this line of the I Ching contains parallel social and strategic teachings. When The Art of War says, in its chapter on �Formation,� that �good warriors take their stand on ground where they cannot lose,� this also means that warriors are living on past accomplishments when they stand on secure ground in war. Conversely, when The Art of War is reinterpreted sociologically, the meaning of this passage is identical to the understanding of the social idealist Cheng Yi� when warriors for good want to take their stand on ground where they cannot lose, they can do so only by
