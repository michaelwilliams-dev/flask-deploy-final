precludes being loved, and dissimulation likewise may preclude honesty, because only fools, dressed in wool, would travel in the company of wolves. Untrusting of human nature, Machiavelli easily understood the motives behind the actions people in the past and the of in present, but would have a difficult time understanding the logic behind those actions. He would have loathed the atrocities of World War I, with the X bayonets and gases spewing over innocent civilians and com.batants alike. Unfortunately, we have learned few lessons from that savagery, either for ourselves or for our future generations. During the Spanish Civil War, the Communists and Fascists fought against each other on behalf of the Spanish people. Many foreigners knowingly chose to fight in support of the good side, the Communist. And honor the good side, Pablo Picasso in of created his masterpiece, Guernica, which stands for their efforts, their dedications and their convictions. These sacrificed their lives while in Russia, Communists were pulverizing millions of people with the most inhuman kinds of torture. And no one made a ripple of a single demonstration against those atrocities, even when similar ones took place in China. THE PRINCE � 11 the to How does one explain support given regimes, which have killed over 90 million innocent people? Why would anyone choose regimes that forced people to kill or be killed? In view of the facts, Machiavelli would be hard put for words. When greater savagery took place in Germany, hardly anyone demonstrated against those atrocities, while leaders from other nations appeased the conquering tyrant, because he was doing it to someone else. During the Vietnam War, people demonstrated against the war, but never against those who were committing genocide by exterminating millions of innocent fellow beings to fulfill tenets of political systems spawned in foreign countries. Hundreds of thousands demonstrated for Saddam Hussein, who torched numberless oil fields whose uncontrolled blazes contaminated atmosphere and land alike; thousands more demon.strated on his behalf even when his weapons of mass destruction (whose only purpose is to kill or degrade life) were obviously be.ing stored for use against other human beings. And people will.ingly became human shields in demonstrating on behalf of this committed tyrant, who, on having invaded three countries, having mounted a missile attack on a fourth, and having used deadly gas that killed thousands, not one person or group or the Pope was found significantly demonstrating against him or against his des.potic regime. There are always all kinds of rationale behind this behavior. But ultimately, as Machiavelli observed, we are all driven by our two basic instincts, which are blind and unresponsive to the brain and to the heart. One needs to consider the behavior of two repre.sentative individuals, by asking, even if rhetorically, Where would America be, in 2003, had Lindbergh been the leader to implement his convictions on the nation during World War II instead of President Roosevelt implementing his? With his perception of an �evil� America, would it be a good
