then the borders are sealed and passports are revoked, not letting messengers through, lest there be information leaks. Master Sun Matters are dealt with strictly at headquarters. MEI YAOCHEN Strictness at headquarters in the planning stage refers to secrecy. Master Sun When opponents present openings, you should penetrate them immediately. Get to what they want first, subtly anticipate them. Maintain discipline and adapt to the enemy in order to determine the outcome of the war. Thus, at first you are like a maiden, so the enemy opens his door; then you are like a rabbit on the loose, so the enemy cannot keep you out. [ 12 ] Fire Attack Master Sun There are five kinds of fire attack: burning people, burning supplies, burning equipment, burning storehouses, and burning weapons. The use of fire must have a basis, and requires certain tools. There are appropriate times for setting fires, namely when the weather is dry and windy. Generally, in fire attacks it is imperative to follow up on the crises caused by the fires. When fire is set inside an enemy camp, then respond quickly from outside.

MEI YAOCHEN A daytime wind will stop at night, a night wind will stop at daylight. Master Sun Armies must know there are adaptations of the five kinds of fire attack, and adhere to them scientifically. ZHANG YU It will not do just to know how to attack others with fire, it is imperative to know how to prevent others from attacking you. You should figure out the weather patterns and adhere strictly to the principle of setting fire attacks only on suitably windy days. Master Sun So the use of fire to help an attack means clarity, use of
