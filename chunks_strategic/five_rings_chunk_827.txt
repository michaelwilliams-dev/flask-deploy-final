She started out as a concubine of an emperor, but did not want to follow the traditional path: that of living the rest of her life in a convent after the emperor’s death. She had seduced the emperor’s son in the royal urinal and befriended his wife. Because of this Wu was able to get a royal edict out of the convent. She returned to the harem, became pregnant, and murdered her own baby, knowing the prime suspect would be the jealous wife of the new emperor. The wife was charged with murder and executed. Wu took her place and her new husband handed over the reins of government to her, opting for a life of pleasure. Empress Wu ruled until the age of eighty when she was forced to abdicate. Throughout her rule she eliminated son after son, anyone who would challenge her throne. Wisdom in a nutshell: • S h o w n o m e r c y .
