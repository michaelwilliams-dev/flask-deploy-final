HONORE Dr.BALZAC. 1'/‘)‘)~1 850 L1?;'PREFACELove and affection are alsopotentially destructive, inthattheyblind youtotheoften self-serving interests ofthose whom you least suspect of playingapower game. You cannot repress angerorlove, oravoid feeling them, andyoushould nottry.Butyoushould becareful about howyouex- press them, and most important, theyshould never influence your plans andstrategies inany way. Related tomastering youremotions istheabilitytodistance yourself from thepresentmoment and think objectivelyabout thepast and future. Like Janus, the double—faced Roman deityandguardian ofallgatesand doorways, youmust beable tolook inboth directions atonce, thebetter to handle dangerfrom wherever itcomes. Such istheface youmust create for yourself-onefacelooking continuouslytothefuture and theother tothe ast.P For thefuture, the motto is,“No daysunalert.” Nothing should catch you bysurprise because youareconstantly imagining problemsbefore theyarise. Instead ofspending yourtime dreaming ofyour plan’s happy ending, youmust work oncalculating every possible permutationandpit- fallthatmight emergeinit.The further you see, the more stepsaheadyou plan,the more powerful youbecome. The other face ofJanus looks constantlytothepast—though not tore- member pasthurts orbeargrudges.That would onlycurb your power. Half ofthegameislearninghow toforgetthose events inthepastthat eat awayatyouand cloud yourreason. The realpurpose ofthebackward- glancing eyeistoeducate yourself constantly—youlook atthepasttolearn from those who came beforeyou. (The many historical examplesinthis book willgreatly helpthatprocess.) Then, having looked tothepast, you look closer athand, toyourown actions and those ofyourfriends. This is the most vital school youcan learn from, because itcomes from personal experience. Youbegin byexaminingthemistakesyouhave made inthepast,the ones that have most grievously heldyouback. Youanalyzethem interms ofthe48laws ofpower, and you extract from them alesson and anoath: “Ishall never repeatsuch amistake; Ishall never fall into such atrap again.” Ifyoucan evaluate and observe yourselfinthisway, youcan learn tobreak thepatterns ofthepast—an immenselyvaluable skill. Power requirestheabilitytoplaywithappearances.Tothis end you must learn towearmanymasks andkeepabagfullofdeceptivetricks. De- ceptionandmasquerade should notbeseen asuglyorimmoral. Allhuman interaction requires deceptiononmany levels, and insomewayswhatsep— arates humans from animals isourability tolieand deceive. InGreek myths,inIndia’s Mahabharata cycle,intheMiddle Eastern epic ofGilga~ mesh, itistheprivilegeofthegodstousedeceptive arts; agreat man, Odysseus forinstance, wasjudged byhisabilitytorival thecraftiness ofthe gods, stealingsome oftheir divinepower bymatchingthem inwits and de- ception. Deceptionisadevelopedartofcivilization and the most potent weaponinthegame ofpower. You cannot succeed atdeception unless youtake asomewhat dis- tanced approachtoyourself——-unless youcan bemanydifferent people, wearing themask that thedayand themoment require.With such aflexi« bleapproachtoallappearances, including your own, you lose alotofthe inward heaviness that holds peopledown. Makeyourface asmalleable as theactor’s, work toconcealyourintentions from others, practice luring people into traps. Playingwithappearances andmasteringartsofdecep tion areamongthe aesthetic pleasures oflife.Theyarealsokey compo« nents intheacquisition ofpower. Ifdeception isthemost potent weaponinyour arsenal, then patience inallthingsisyour crucial shield. Patience willprotect youfrom making moronic blunders, Like mastering your emotions, patienceis :1skill-—it does not come naturally.Butnothingaboutpowerisnatural; poweris more godlikethan anythinginthenatural world.
