besimply good forthephilosopher, andthathence itis somewhat questionable forothermen aswell.Forthephilosopher to dedicate himself tothecitywould notresult either inthesalvation of mankind orthepromotion ofhisownwisdom. Hehastoliveinacity, however, andmust count onothermen topreserve him; therefore he must care foratleast amodicum ofjustice inthecity.Butthiscare is only necessary, notdesirable initself.Theanswer toGlaucon's ques- tion—Is justice good initself oronly instrumentally?— isthat justice conceived asdedication tothecity isonly instrumentally good. But there isonekindofdoing good toone's friends which isalsobeneficial tothephilosopher. There aresomeyoung men inwhom hissoul delights, forthey have souls akin tohisownand arepotential philosophers; these aremenwhomayeven aidhiminhisuncompleted quest forwisdom. Glaucon himself may wellbeoneofthem. Inthe caseofmost citizens, thephilosopher's concern isonly thathedothem noharm, andhisjustice thushasthecharacter ofaburdensome duty. Inthecaseofthepromising young, heisconcerned withdoing them a [411 ] THEREPUBLIC positive good,andhisjustice hasthecharacter oflove.Hemust always carry onacontest with thecityfortheaffections ofitssons.Although hehasaduty tothecity,heisalways atwarwith it. {543a-569c) Theelaboration ofthebestregime andtheway of lifecorresponding toitisnotasufficient response toGlaucon's original demand, which was tocompare the lifeofthejustmanandthatofthe unjustmanwith respect totheir happiness. Inhisspeech infavor ofin- justice Glaucon described theadvantages oftheunjust man's life;those alleged advantages mustbelooked atagain inthelightofwhatGlaucon haslearned inthecourse ofthedialogue. IfGlaucon istobeconverted, hemustcompare what previously attracted himwithwhathehascome toadmire. This calls forapresentation ofthebadregimes ofcityand soul aswell asthegood. Following thehypothesis ofthedialogue, according towhich the city isthesoulwrit large, Socrates turns firsttothediscussion ofthein- ferior cities.Theparallelism ofthecityandthesoul ismaintained here (asitwas inBook IV)inspiteofthefactthat ithasbecome most ques- tionable. This procedure hastherhetorical advantage ofmaking justice, which isadmittedly desirable inacity,appear equally desirable inthesoul.When Glaucon seesand isforced toadmit thatthecity ruledbyatyrant isaterrible place, heismore easily induced toview thetyrant asaterrible man. Inpreparing thedirect confrontation ofphilosopher andtyrant forGlaucon's benefit, Socrates makes useofAdeimantus andhispar- ticular qualities. Throughout, Glaucon andAdeimantus havebalanced each other, andthey areperfectly matched asinterlocutors. Without their specific characters andSocrates' judicious blending ofthem, the founding ofthecityinspeech would havebeen impossible. Glaucon is thedaring, manly lover ofvictory whose erasleadshimdirectly tothe conquest ofthegood things asheseesthem, andwhose spiritedness aidshim inhisendeavor. He isresponsible fortheprogress ofthe dialogue: itisGlaucon whowanted togotothePiraeus toseethe festival, andwhodecided forboth Socrates andhimself thattheywould heed Polemarchus andAdeimantus and stay. ItisGlaucon whowas perplexed and interested bySocrates' discussion ofpayments for ruling; itishewho insisted oncontinuing theargument about justice andmost convincingly portrayed theadvantages ofinjustice. Moreover, itisGlaucon whose appetites forced theabandonment of thecityofsows,whocompelled Socrates totellofallthevirtues, toin- troduce thephilosopher-kings, and todiscuss thegood. Glaucon's feverish intensity istheimpulse that carries thediscussion forward to thegreatest innovations andthemost extreme satisfaction. [412 ] Interpretive Essay Adeimantus, bycontrast, isamoderate manandalover oftragic poetry. Hisspiritedness isdirected inward and itmakes him austere. He isthus amore reliable citizen thanGlaucon with hismany and powerful desires. He isamoralist andadefender ofcivil life.Hewas theonewho,bythepromise ofinteresting sights, persuaded Glaucon andSocrates tojointhe littlecommunity ofmen inthePiraeus. Itis Adeimantus whohelped Socrates tobuild thehealthy city,andhewas contented with it.He istheagent ofthepurification ofthefeverish city.And,above all,heistheaccuser ofSocrates, theonewho forces him tostopand justify himself tothecity.Adeimantus speaks inthe name ofthepolitical menwho areoffended andthreatened byboth Glaucon's andSocrates' unconventional notions. Heaccuses Socrates ofnotmaking thewarriors happy, ofrobbing hisfriends ofanadequate discussion ofcommunism, and ofimposing useless orvicious philosophers onthecityasrulers.He isnecessary tothebuilding ofa city;andheisnecessary tothatpunishment ofthebodily passions which isthecondition ofGlaucon's reformation. Just asGlaucon is dangerous because heisapotential subverter ofthelaws,Adeimantus isdangerous because heisapotential accuser ofphilosophy. Just as Glaucon canbeuseful because hetends toward philosophy, soAdei- mantus canbeuseful because hetends toward public spiritedness. InBooks VIIIandIXAdeimantus finally ceases being Socrates' opponent andbecomes hiswholehearted ally.Foratthispoint acity hasbeenfounded
