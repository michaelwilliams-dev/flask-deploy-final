"Well, then, go on to understand that by the other segment of the intelligible I mean that which argument itself grasps with the power of dialectic, making the hypotheses not beginnings but really hy? potheses-that is, steppingstones and springboards-in order to reach what is free from hypothesis at the beginning of the whole.38 When it has grasped this, argument now depends on that which depends on this beginning and in such fashion goes back down again to an end; making no use of anything sensed in any way, but using forms them? selves, going through forms to forms, it ends in forms too." "I understand," he said, "although not adequately-for in my opinion it's an enormous task you speak of-that you wish to distinguish that part of what is and is intelligible contemplated by the knowl? edge of dialectic as being clearer than that part contemplated by what are called the arts. The beginnings in the arts are hypotheses; and al? though those who behold their objects are compelled to do so with the thought and not the senses, these men-because they don't consider them by going up to a beginning, but rather on the basis of hypotheses-these men, in my opinion, don't possess intelligence with respect to the objects, even though they are, given a begin? ning, intelligible; and you seem to me to call the habit of geometers and their likes thought and not intelligence, indicating that thought is something between opinion and intelligence." 510d e 511 a b C d ;11 d "You have made a most adequate exposition," I said. "And, along with me, take these four affections arising in the soul in relation to the four segments: intellection in relation to the highest one, and thought in c. relation to the second; to the third assign trust, and to the last imagina? tion.39 Arrange them in a proportion, and believe that asï¿½ the seg? ments to which they correspond participate in truth, so they participate in clarity." "I understand," he said. "And I agree and arrange them as you say." BOOK VII "Next, then," I said, "make an image of our nature in its educa? tion and want of education, likening it to a condition of the following kind. See human beings as though they were in an underground cave? Jike dwelling with its entrance, a long one, open to the light across the whole width of the cave. They are in it from childhood with their legs and necks in bonds so that they are fixed, seeing only in front of them, unabJe because of the bond to tum their heads all the way around. Their light is from a fire burning far above and behind them. Between the fire and the prisoners there is a road above, along which see a wan, built like the partitions puppet-handlers set in front of the human beings and
