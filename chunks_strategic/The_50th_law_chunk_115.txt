group of tight-knit disciples who would help protect him and overcome his sense of isolation. To make this a reality, he told his closest friends to convene a meeting in his grandparents� house in Southside Queens. They were to invite his most fervent fans in the neighborhood�the young men whom they knew to be loyal and dependable. And they should all bring guns to help secure the street before Fifty showed up. When Fifty finally entered the living room of his grandparents� house the day of the meeting, he could feel the energy and excitement. The space was filled with over twenty young men, all ready to do his bidding. He began by painting for them his precise vision of the future. His music now was hot, but it was going to get a lot hotter. Within two more years, he was certain to land a major record deal. In his head, he already could hear the songs for his first record, visualize the cover and the overall concept�it was to be the story of his life.

He needed followers and he had chosen them. Almost all of them agreed to the proposal, and over the years to come many of them stayed on to gain important positions within his expanding empire. And if they ever stopped to think about it, it was uncanny how close the future had come to resemble the picture he had painted so many years before. By 2007, after the tremendous success of his first two records, Fifty began to sense a problem looming on the horizon. He had created an image for the public, a Fifty myth that centered on his tough and menacing presence and his
