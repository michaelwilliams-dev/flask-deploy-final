being compromised by the vagaries of the unpredictable and the unforeseen. In a highly competitive environment, development as the �rear guard� backing up vanguard research is kept �hidden,� or secret, so that everyone is not doing the same thing at the same time. This makes constructive, evolutionary competition possible, while helping to maintain a relatively open space in which public opinion can be expressed. The �main force� of existing infrastructure (including abstract, conceptual infrastructures of culture) remains immobile in the sense that it requires a degree of stability in order to function effectively, yet must �see what the enemy will do� in order to evolve the organs and operations needed by the society, the company, and the individual to manage challenging or threatening situations. King Wei asked, �Suppose the enemy comes out when I go out, and I do not yet know whose numbers are greater; what should I do?� The reply to this question is missing. Based on relevant materials in this and related texts, it might be surmised that Master Sun would be likely to have recommended tactics designed to feel out the opponent while concealing one�s own strengths. King Wei asked, �How should one attack desperadoes?� Master Sun answered, �. . . [Wait] until they find a way to live.� The most ancient Chinese classic, the I Ching, or Book of Changes, is the first to outline this particular strategy of not driving opponents to deadly desperation. There, this is symbolized by a king on a hunt using only three chasers, leaving one corner of the dragnet open in order to give the prey a fighting chance to escape. The principle is that a �cornered rat� may turn on its pursuer with inconceivably deadly force if it is driven to a frenzy in absolute despair. Given a chance to escape, the reasoning goes, vanquished opponents will not become embittered diehards and need not be imprisoned, suppressed, or exterminated to achieve and maintain peace and social order in the aftermath of conflict. King Wei asked, �How do you attack equals?� Master Sun replied, �Confusing them and splitting them up, I concentrate my troops to pick them off without the enemy realizing what is going on. If the enemy does not split up, however, settle down and do not move; do not strike where there is doubt.� Confusing and splitting an opponent�s force is done in order to diffuse and blunt the enemy of an attack as well as to compromise the security of the enemy�s defense. Striking the diffuse with concentrated force is a way to shift the balance of strategic factors in one�s own favor when facing an adversary of equal size and strength. Concentration and diffusions are both mental and physical, applying to attention, momentum, force, numbers, and material resources. The existence of doubt means that there is diffusion of attention, resulting in loss of concentration; therefore it is recommended that no action be initiated in doubtful situations. King Wei asked, �Is there a way to
