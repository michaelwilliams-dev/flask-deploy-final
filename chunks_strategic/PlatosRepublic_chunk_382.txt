society are not in injustice and the blood of the innocent, and the past does not provide a model for tyrannic methods of rule. The harsh facts of the foundings of cities are covered over because of the temptations engendered by their example. Glaucon, in his first speech on justice, asserted that a thing could be understood by its origin, or that its origin is its nature. Socrates taught, in the discussion of the ideas, that the end, not the origin, of a thing is its nature. Here he ap? peals to Glaucon's faulty philosophic understanding by putting what is really the end at the origin. Finally, it must be stressed again that there is a downward movement of the regimes, that there is no indication that this trend can be reversed, and that the final tyranny does not lead back again toward one of the superior regimes. It is the fault of man, not of gods or nature, that decay occurs, but once having occurred, the original state of innocence cannot be recovered. At best men can strug? gle against further decay, but they cannot hope to establish the best regime by their own effort. By this mode of presentation Socrates teach? es Glaucon and Adeimantus that the ancestral is truly respectable be- cause it was wise ï¿½and just, and that it cannot be improved upon. Thus he makes them moderate without being closed to reason, as respect for what is truly ancestral would make them. Socrates and Adeimantus discuss each of the regimes before they discuss the man corresponding to it. Therefore, they have the tendency (as was the case in Book IV) to see in the man what they saw in the city. This predetermines the somewhat questionable result that men have the same rank order of goodness which was found in regimes. For example, there is some doubt whether a man who pursues money alone is simply preferable to one who devotes himself to spending it in a variety of pleasures. But the anti-democratic Adeimantus readily agrees that oligarchy is superior to democracy; thus it appears, from his connection with the oligarchic regime, that the oligarchic man is the superior human type. This is obviously not an exhaustive account of the men under consideration, but it serves Socrates' intention, which is to condemn the tyrannic man. To do this, the desires must be con? demned, particularly the erotic desires. This condemnation of the desires is the key to the rank order of the men-the more desire is dom? inant in them, the lower they are on the scale. However, this princi? ple of order is not manifest to desiring men such as Glaucon. It is given plausibility by the fact that in the cities selfish desire is what most leads to injustice. From a strictly political standpoint, the denigration of desire is necessitated; from the standpoint of an individual who wants to be happy, it is not so easily accepted or seen to be necessary. This
