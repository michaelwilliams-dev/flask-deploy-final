"The tyrant ofwhom youspeak," Isaid, "isablessed thing, ifhe usessuchmen asfriends andtrustworthy helpers afterhehasdestroyed 568a hisformer ones." "Buthecertainly doesusesuchmen," hesaid. "And these companions admire him," Isaid, "and thenew citizens have intercourse withhim,while thedecent menhatehimand fleefrom him." "What elsewould theydo?" "It'snotfornothing," Isaid, "that tragedy ingeneral hasthe reputation ofbeing wise and,within it,Euripides ofbeing particularly so. "Why isthat?" "Because, among other things, heuttered thisphrase, theproduct ofshrewd thought, 'tyrants arewise from intercourse with the b wise.'2* Andheplainly meant thatthesemenwejustspoke ofarethe wisewithwhom atyrant hasintercourse." "And heandtheother poets," hesaid, "extol tyranny asacon- dition 'equal tothatofagod'^" andaddmuch else, too." "Therefore," Isaid, 'Tjecause thetragic poets arewise, they par- don us,and allthosewhohaveregimes resembling ours, fornotadmit- ingthem intotheregime ontheground thattheymake hymns to tyranny." "Isuppose," hesaid, "they pardon us,atleast allthesubtle ones among them." c "And Isuppose that,going around totheother cities, gathering [247 ] socrates/adeimantus theREPUBLIpI 568ccrowds, and hiring fine, bigandpersuasive voices, theydrawthe regimes toward tyrannies anddemocracies." "Quite so." "And, besides this, they getwages andarehonored too,mostof allbytyrants, asistobeexpected, and, inthesecond place, by democracy. Butthehigher theygoontheslope oftheregimes,the dmore theirhonor fails, asthough itwere unable toproceed forwant of breath." "Most certainly." "But here we've digressed," Isaid. "Let's return tothe tyrant's camp, that fair,numerous, many-colored thing that isnever thesame and tellfromwhere itssupport vwllcome." "It's plain," hesaid, "that ifthere issacred money inthe city, he'llspend itaslong asitlasts, along with theproperty ofthemenhe hasdestroyed, 31sothatpeople won't becompelled tobring in such large contributions." e "Andwhathappens when thatsource gives out?" "It's plain," hesaid, "thatheand hisdrinking fellows andcom- rades, maleandfemale, willgettheir support from hisfather's proper- "Iunderstand," Isaid."The people thatbegot thetyrant willsup- porthimandhiscomrades." "Agreat necessity willcompel it,"hesaid. "Butwhatdoyouhave tosaytothis?"

"ByZeus,how thiskindofapeople willthenknow," hesaid,"thekind b ofabeast theyhave begotten, welcomed, andmade great, and that they aretheweaker driving outthestronger!" "What areyou saying?" Isaid. "Will thetyrant dare touse forceonhisfather, and ifhedoesn't obey, strike him?" "Yes," hesaid,"once he'stakenaway hisfather's arms." "You speak ofthetyrant asaparricide andaharsh nurse ofold age,"32 Jsai(]^ "and, asitseems, thiswould atlastbeself-admitted tyranny and, asthesaying goes, thepeople infleeing thesmoke of [248 ] Book VIII 1568e-569c sochates/adeimantus enslavement tofreemenwould have fallen intothefireofbeing under 569c themastery ofslaves; intheplace ofthatgreatandunseasonable free- domtheyhaveputonthedress oftheharshest andbitterest enslave- ment toslaves." "That's exactly what happens," hesaid. "Well then," Isaid,"wouldn't webespeaking appropriately ifwe asserted thatwehave given anadequate presentation ofhow atyranny istransformed outofademocracy, andwhat itislikewhen ithascome intobeing?" "Most certainly," hesaid, "itwasadequate."
