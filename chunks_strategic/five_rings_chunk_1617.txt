much longer,with devastatingresults. Mao was fartooclever tolet anger spoilthe chance tokill two birds with one stone. Inessence, Mao used twocat’s-pawstohelp him attain total victory. First, hecleverlybaited Chiangintotaking chargeofthe waragainsttheJapanese.Mao knew the Nationalists ledbyChiangwould domost ofthehard fighting and would succeed inpushingtheJapaneseoutofChina, iftheydidnothave tocon- cern themselves with fightingtheCommunists atthe same time. The Na- tionalists, then, were thefirstcat’s—paw,used toevict theJapanese.But Mao also knew that intheprocessofleadingthe waragainst theinvaders, theJapanese artilleryand airsupportwould decimate theconventional forces oftheNationalists, doing damage itcould take the Communists decades toinflict. Whywaste time and lives iftheJapanese could dothe jobquickly? Itwas this wisepolicy ofusingonecat’s—pawafter another that allowed theCommunists toprevail. There aretwo uses ofthecat’s—paw:tosaveappearances,asCleopatra did, and tosaveenergyand effort. The latter case inparticular demands thatyouplanseveral moves inadvance, realizingthat atemporarymove backward (letting Chiang go,say)can lead toagiant leap forward. Ifyou aretemporarilyweakened and need time torecover, itwill often serveyou well touse those aroundyouboth asascreen tohideyourintentions and asacat’s~pawtodoyourwork foryou.Look for apowerfulthird partywho shares anenemywithyou(iffordifferent reasons), then take advantage of their superior powertodeal blows which would have costyoumuch more energy,sinceyouareweaker. You can even gently guidethem into hostili- ties.Alwayssearch outtheoverly aggressiveaspotential cat’s-paws—they areoften more thanwillingtogetinto afight,andyoucan choose justthe rightfightforyour purposes.
