When Castruccio wastold that ithad been a terrible wrongtokillsuch anoldfriend, herepliedthat hehad executed not anoldfriend but anewenemy. Aman likeCastruccio knows only force and self—interest. When the re- bellion began,toend itandplace oneself athismercywas the most dan— gerous possiblemove. Even once Stefano diPoggiohad made that fatal mistake, however, hestill hadoptions:Hecould have offeredmoneyto Castruccio, could have made promises forthefuture, could have pointed outwhat thePoggioscould stillcontribute toCastruccio’s power-their in- fluence with the most influential families ofRome, forexample, and the great marriage theycould have brokered. Instead Stefano brought upthepast,and debts that carried noobliga- tion. Notonlyisaman notobligedtobegrateful, gratitude isoften aterri- bleburden that hegladly discards. And inthis case Castruccio ridhimself ofhisobligationstothePoggios byeliminating thePoggios. OBSERVANCE OFTHE LAW In4-33 B.C.,just before thePeloponnesian War, theisland ofCorcyra (later called Corfu) and theGreek city~state ofCorinth stood onthebrink ofcon- flict. Both partiessent ambassadors toAthens totrytowin over theAtheni~ anstotheir side. The stakes were high,since whoever had Athens onhis side was sure towin. And whoever won the war would certainly givethe defeated side nomercy. Corcyra spoke first. Itsambassador began byadmittingthat theisland had never helped Athens before, and infact had allied itself with Athens’s enemies. There were notiesoffriendshiporgratitude between Corcyra and Athens. Yes, theambassador achnitted, hehad come toAthens now outoffear and concern forCorcyra’s safety.Theonly thinghecould offer was analliance ofmutual interests. Corcyra had anavy only surpassedin size andstrength byAthens’s own; analliance between the two states would create aformidable force, onethat could intimidate therival state of Sparta. That, unfortunately,was allOorcyrahad tooffer. The representativefrom Corinth then gaveabrilliant, passionate speech,insharpcontrast tothedry, colorless approach oftheCorcyran. Hetalked ofeverything Corinth had done forAthens inthepast.Heasked how itwould look toAthens’s other allies ifthecityputanagreement with aformer enemyover one with apresent friend, one that had served Athens’s interest loyally: Perhaps those allies would break their agreements with Athens iftheysaw that their loyaltywas not valued.

Interpretation History hasremembered theAthenians nobly, buttheywere thepreemi- nent realists ofclassical Greece. With them, alltherhetoric, allthe emo- tionalappealsintheworld, could notmatch agood pragmatic argument, especiallyone that added totheirpower. What theCorinthian ambassador did not realize was that hisrefer- ences toCorinth’s past generositytoAthens only irritated theAthenians, subtly askingthem tofeelguiltyandputtingthem under obligation.The Athenians couldn’t care less about pastfavors andfriendly feelings.Atthe same time, theyknew thatiftheir other allies thoughtthem ungratefulfor abandoning Corinth, these city-states would stillbeunlikelytobreak their ties toAthens, thepreeminent powerinGreece. Athens ruled itsempire by force, andwould simply compel anyrebellious allytoreturn tothefold.
