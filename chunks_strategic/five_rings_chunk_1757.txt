OBSERVANCE OFTHE LAW When World V\7ar IIended and theJapanese, who had invaded China in1937, hadfinallybeen thrown out, theChinese Nationalists, lead by Chiang Kai-shek, decided the time had come toannihilate theChinese Communists, their hated rivals, once and forall.Theyhad almost suc- ceeded in1935, forcing theCommunists into theLong March, thegrueling retreat that hadgreatlydiminished their numbers. Although theCommu« nists had recovered somewhat during the waragainst japan,itwould not bedifficult todefeat them now. Theycontrolled only isolated areas inthe countryside,had unsophisticated weaponry,lackedanymilitary experi- ence ortraining beyondmountain fighting,and controlled noimportant partsofChina, exceptareas ofManchutia, which theyhadmanagedtotake after theJapaneseretreat. Chiang decided tocommit hisbest forces in Manclmria. Hewould take over itsmajorcities andfrom those bases would spread through thisnorthern industrial region, sweepingtheCommunists away.Once Manchuria had fallen theCommunists would collapse. In1945 and ’46theplan worked perfectly:The Nationalists easily took themajor Manchurian cities. Puzzlingly, though,intheface ofthis critical campaign, theCommunist strategy made no sense. When theNa- tionalists began their push, theCommunists dispersed toManchuria’s most out-of—the-waycorners. Their small units harassed theNationalist armies, ambushing them here, retreating unexpectedly there, but these dispersed units never linkedup,makingthem hard toattack. They would seize a town onlytogive itupafew weeks later. Forming neither rearguardsI101’ vanguards, theymoved likemercury,never staying inoneplace,elusive and formless. The Nationalists ascribed this totwothings: cowardice inthe face ofsuperior forces andinexperienceinstrategy. Mao Tse~tung, theCom» munjst leader, was more apoetandphilosopherthan ageneral, whereas Chiang had studied warfare intheWest and was afollower oftheGerman militarywriter Carl VonClausewitz, amongothers. Yet apattern dideventually emergeinMao‘s attacks. After theNation- alists had taken thecities, leavingtheCommunists tooccupy what was gen- erallyconsidered Ma.nchun‘a’s uselessspace,theCommunists started using thatlarge spacetosurround thecities. IfChiangsent anarmy from onecity toreinforce another, theCommunists would encircle therescuing army. Chia.ng’sforces were slowlybroken into smaller and smaller units, isolated from oneanother, their lines ofsupply and communication cut.The Na- tionalists still hadsuperior firepower, butifthey could not move, what goodwas it? Akind ofterror overcame theNationalist soldiers. Commanders com- fortablyremote from thefront lines might laughaxMan, butthesoldiers hadfought theCommunists inthemountains, and had come tofear their elusiveness. Now these soldiers satintheir cities and watched astheir fast- moving enemies, asfluid aswater, pouredinonthem from allsides. There seemed tobemillions ofthem. The Communists also encircled thesol- diers’spirits, bombarding them withpropagandatolower their morale and pressurethem todesert. The Nationalists began tosurrender intheir minds. Their encircled and isolated cities started collapsingeven before being directly attacked; one after another fellinquicksuccession. InNovember of1948, theNa- tionalists surrendered Manchuria totheCommunist»-a humiliafingblow tothetechnically superior Nationalistarmy,and one thatproveddecisive inthe war.Bythefollowing yeartheCommunists controlled allofChina.
