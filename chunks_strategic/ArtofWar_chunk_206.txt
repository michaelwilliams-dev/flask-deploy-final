�To be violent at first and wind up fearing one�s people is the epitome of ineptitude.� In the chapter on �Fire Attack,� he says, �A government should not mobilize an army out of anger, leaders should not provoke war out of wrath. Act when it is beneficial, desist if it is not.� The I Ching�s statement on �Contention� continues, �[When] obstructed, be careful to be balanced, for that will lead to good results. Finality leads to bad results.� Cheng Yi says: People who contend match their reasoning with others in anticipation of a decision. Though they may be sincere and truthful, [if there is contention, that means] they are necessarily obstructed; something must be unresolved, for if that were not the case, the matter would already be clear and there would be no dispute. Since the matter is not yet settled, one cannot necessarily say whether it will turn out well or badly. Therefore there is great concern that an auspicious balance be achieved and maintained. If you achieve balance, that bodes well. �Finality leads to bad results� means that if you conclude affairs with unmitigated finality, that bodes ill. On the same principle, in the chapter on �Fire Attack� The Art of War says, �Anger can revert to joy, wrath can revert to delight, but a nation destroyed cannot be restored to existence, and the dead cannot be restored to life. Therefore an enlightened government is careful about this, a good military leadership is alert to this.� In its technical sense in I Ching philosophy, a state of balance or centeredness means an attitude that is not affected by emotion. According to the traditional formula as cited in The Book of Balance and Harmony, a neo-Taoist classic based on the I Ching, �Before emotions arise is called balance; when emotions arise yet are moderate, this is called harmony.� Traditional Taoist teaching understands balance to mean being objective and impartial. In the classical formula of �balance and harmony,� this objective impartiality is always placed first, because it is held to be the practical means whereby harmony can subsequently be attained. Because of the serious consequences of decisions made in contention, the I Ching adds to its statement, �It is beneficial to see a great person.� This is a stock phrase, traditionally understood to mean that real wisdom and knowledge are essential and cannot be replaced by emotional opinion. Cheng Yi describes great people, or people of wisdom, as those who �can settle disputes with firm understanding that is balanced and true.� The Art of War also places great emphasis on the importance of mature guidance, which becomes increasingly critical in times of conflict and crisis: �Leadership is a matter of intelligence, trustworthiness, humaneness, courage, and sternness� (�Strategic Assessments�). According to classical philosophers, impartial wisdom is valuable to all parties in a dispute, insofar as loss already starts with contention and is maximized when contention becomes conflict. Furthermore, for those already involved in struggle, effective deployment of energies depends on guidance
