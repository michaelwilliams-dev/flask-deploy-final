rule for employing a group. MEI YAOCHEN To unify people�s ears and eyes means to make people look and listen in concert so that they do not become confused and disorderly. Signals are used to indicate directions and prevent individuals from going off by themselves. Master Sun So in night battles you use many fires and drums, in daytime battles you use many banners and flags, so as to manipulate people�s ears and eyes. DU MU Have your soldiers adapt their movements according to your signals. MEI YAOCHEN The reason you use many signals is to manipulate and confuse the perceptions of enemies. WANG XI You use many signals to startle their perceptions and make them fear your awesome martial power. Master Sun So you should take away the energy of their armies, and take away the heart of their generals. ZHANG YU Energy is what battle depends on.

These are those who master energy. MEI YAOCHEN The morning means the beginning, midday means the middle, and the evening means the end. What this says is that soldiers are keen at first, but eventually they slump and think of going home, so at this point they are vulnerable. HO YANXI Everyone likes security and dislikes danger, everyone wants to live and fears death�so if you chase them to death�s door for no reason, making them glad to go to battle, it must be because they have angry and contentious energy in their hearts that has temporarily been taken advantage of to stir them into such a
