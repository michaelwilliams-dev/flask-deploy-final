relationships and interactions as well as the overall �plot.� When King Wei of Qi (B.C.E. 356�320) heard of this, he had his general, Tian Ji, lead 80,000 armed troops to the rescue. Pang Juan attacked the capital of Wey. General Tian Ji asked Master Sun Bin, �What should I do if I do not rescue Wey?� When Sun Bin was offered a generalship by King Wei, he refused the honor; ostensibly he did so on account of his physical disabilities, but perhaps for other strategic reasons as well. Instead, he was appointed military adviser to the top general, Tian Ji. Master Sun said, �Please attack Rangling to the south. The walled city of Rangling is small, but its province is large, populous, and well armed. It is the essential military zone in eastern Wei; it is hard to besiege, so I would make a show of confusion. Were I to attack Rangling, I would have the state of Song to my south and the state of Wey to my north, with Shiqiu right in the way, so my supply lines would be cut off; I would thus make a show of incompetence.� Two essential principles of conflict outlined by Sun Bin�s distinguished ancestor Sun Wu are illustrated here. One concerns the way to draw an enemy out of a secure position by attacking a place of strategic value, somewhere that the opponent is sure to go to the defense. The Master of Demon Valley, another Warring States�era strategist, also described the practice of drawing people out in interactions by observing their structures of psychological defense. The exercise of tact, as well as apparent lack of tact, may both be used in strategic encounters as means of observing reaction patterns in actual or potential allies or adversaries, either from a �closed� undercover position (disguised as tact) or from the shifting, roving, deceptively �open� position of the provocateur (disguised as lack of tact). The second principle illustrated here is the use of deceit for strategic advantage in hostile situations. In this case, the particular avenue of deception employed is that of deliberately giving the appearance of confusion and lack of skill in order to make an enemy contemptuous, complacent, and therefore careless, rendering the enemy vulnerable to counterattack. Thus, in situations where strategy is the paramount guide of affairs, it is customary not to take anything naively at face value; yet it is therefore crucial to attain the intelligence and balance to avoid becoming excessively imaginative and lapsing into self- defeating paranoia. So General Tian broke camp and raced to Rangling. Subsequently, General Tian summoned Master Sun and asked, �Now what should I do?� Master Sun said, �Which of the grandees of the cities are ignorant of military affairs?� General Tian replied, �Those in Qi-cheng and Gao-tang.� Here, the least competent are being selected because they are to be pawns in a larger game. Their role, which they are to play unawares, is to keep up the appearance of lack of skill
