in the first place.We all sense that justice is a disposition, as Ceph? alus originally suggested, one which every man must possess in addi? tion to his skill. A doctor must be disposed to heal his patients as well as be able to do so; otherwise he might just as well kill them for profit as cure them. Just why did Socrates tum the conversation in this direc? tion? In the first place, it must be remembered that, with the banish? ment of Cephalus, ancestral authority was replaced by what men can know for themselves, by the evidence of reasoned experience. The arts are the most obvious sources of knowledge available to all men as men without the need of any act of faith or the instruction of a particular tradition. The desire to know what one owes other men would most im? mediately lead in the direction of trying to discern an art which can guide us just as medicine guides us in matters of health. Moreover, however much habit may play a role in the character we call just, it is also clear that it is simply insufficient for a man to follow rules without any knowledge of the reasons behind them. Cephalus is proof enough of that. Our doctors are supposed to obey the Hippocratic oath, and that obedience would, in a sense, make them reliable. But, ultimately, the most important thing is the knowledge of the goodness of that oath, of the reasons why following it is salutary. The worthwhileness of a doctor's activity depends on this; and, no matter how technically profi? cient he may be, his talents are useless or dangerous if there is no knowledge about this first question. Justice necessarily and primarily demands a knowledge of what is good for man and the community; otherwise the knowledge and skills of the arts are in the service of authoritative myths. Now, this discussion with Polemarchus outlines in a negative way what the character of the requisite knowledge must be. It cannot be like any of those arts which are always present in every com? munity-shoemaking, weaving, carpentry, etc. This is what Socrates meant in the Apology when he told of his quest for wise men. Poets and statesmen, he found, knew literally nothing, whereas artisans did in- deed know something. Unfortunately their knowledge was limitedï¿½and partial, and Socrates said that he would prefer to be ignorant as he was than knowledgeable as they were. For they were content with their competence and closed to the larger questions. To be ignorant in Soc? rates' way is to be open to the whole. The artisans are models of knowledge, but their kind of knowledge is not applicable to the domain of poets and statesmen. The problem is to combine the concerns of poets and statesmen with knowledge as artisans possess it. Such knowledge is what Socrates is seeking. The discussion with Polemarchus leads to the same result as the questioning of the artisans described in
