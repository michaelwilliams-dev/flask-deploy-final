surprise, employing endless variations of tactics, using opponents� psychological conditions to maneuver them into vulnerable positions. The essence of Sun Tzu�s teaching on force is unity and coherence in an organization, using the force of momentum rather than relying on individual qualities and talents: �Good warriors seek effectiveness in battle from the force of momentum, not from individual people.� It is this recognition of the power of the group to even out internal disparities and function as one body of force that sets The Art of War apart from the idiosyncratic individualism of the samurai swordsmen of late feudal Japan, whose stylized martial arts are so familiar in the West. This emphasis is one of the essential features that has made Sun Tzu�s ancient work so useful for the corporate warriors of modern Asia, among whom The Art of War is widely read and still regarded as the matchless classic of strategy in conflict. The sixth chapter takes up the subject of �emptiness and fullness,� already noted as fundamental Taoist concepts commonly adapted to martial arts. The idea is to be filled with energy while at the same time draining opponents, in order, as Master Sun says, to make oneself invincible and take on opponents only when they are vulnerable. One of the simplest of these tactics is well known not only in the context of war, but also in social and business maneuvering: �Good warriors get others to come to them, and do not go to others.� Conserving one�s own energy while inducing others to dissipate theirs is another function of the inscrutability so highly prized by the Taoist warrior: �The consummation of forming an army is to arrive at formlessness,� says Master Sun, for then no one can formulate a strategy against you. At the same time, he says, induce opponents to construct their own formations, get them to spread themselves thin; test opponents to gauge their resources and reactions, but remain unknown yourself. In this case, formlessness and fluidity are not merely means of defense and surprise, but means of preserving dynamic potential, energy that could easily be lost by trying to hold on to a specific position or formation. Master Sun likens a successful force to water, which has no constant form but, as the Tao-te Ching notes, prevails over everything in spite of its apparent weakness: Sun says, �A military force has no constant formation, water has no constant shape. The ability to gain victory by changing and adapting according to the opponent is called genius.� The seventh chapter of The Art of War, on armed struggle, dealing with concrete field organization and combat maneuvers, recapitulates several of Sun Tzu�s main themes. Beginning with the need for information and preparation, Sun says, �Act after having made assessments. The one who first knows the measures of far and near wins�this is the rule of armed struggle.� The I Ching says, �Be prepared, and you will be lucky.� Again expounding his characteristic minimalist/essentialist tactical philosophy, Sun Tzu
