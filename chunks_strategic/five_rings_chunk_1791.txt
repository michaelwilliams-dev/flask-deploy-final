Because theRomans didinthese cases what anysavvy Prince must do—aPrince must notonly oversee current scan- dals, butlook tofuture ones andones, which canbeavoided. By taking care immediately ofthings, crises canbeavoided, butpre- varicating andputting them off,themedicine doesn't come in time because thedisease isincurable. What thedoctors sayabout behavior istruehere too,thatin thebeginning ofsomething baditiseasy tocure although diffi- culttoknow it,butwith time, nothaving recognized ortreated it, itbecomes easy toknow buthard tocure. Itisthesame with af- fairs ofstate: spotting something wrong quickly (which takes prudence), onecures itquickly. Butif,notrecognizing what is going on,things arelefttofester soeverybody sees them, then there isnoremedy. TheRomans, quick toseewrong things, always took care of them; they knew youcouldn’t always escape warwithout giving theadvantage toothers. Butthey wanted warwith Philip andAn- tiochus inGreece inorder nottofight them inItaly. They could have temporized with both ofthem, butdidn't. Neither didthey accept theview ofeveryone who saidlettime take care ofit,but practiced their own virtue andprudence. Time runs everything ahead ofit,andtime canbring good with bad, butalsobadwith good. Butlet’s look again atFrance andlet'sseeifanyone didwhat wesay.Ihave tomention Louis XIIandnotCharles VIII asthe onewho held Italy longer andwhose course ofaction ismore ob- vious; youwillseethathedidthecontrary ofwhat needs tobe done tohold onto aforeign province. King Louis XIIwassetinItaly bytheambitions oftheVene THE PRINCE —37 tians who hoped toannex Lombardy bygetting himtocome. I don't want toblame theKing forcoming, butheputafootinItaly without having anyfriends because ofthebehavior ofCharles VIII. Alldoors being shut, hehadtoaccept what friendships he could find; hemight have done well ifhehadn't made other mis- takes. Annexing Lombardy, hewon thereputation hetook from Charles. Genoa caved inandtheFlorentines became hisfriends. The March ofMantua, Duke ofFerrara, Bentivogli, Forlì, and Lords ofFaenza, Pesaro, Rimini, Camerino, Piombino, Lucca, Pisa, andSiena allbecame hisfriends. TheVenetians were alittle surprised attheir temerity because, justtoacquire Lombardy, they hadmade Louis King ofathird ofItaly. Think with what ease theKing could have kept hisreputation inItaly ifhehadobserved therules outlined above. Hecould have done itifhehadkept hisfriendships safeandsound —there were alotofthem, weak andfearful, from theChurch totheVe- netians, who needed tostick byhim. With their help hecould have easily warded offothers who remained powerful. Butno sooner washeinMilan than hegave aidtoPope Alexander, help- inghimtooccupy Romagna. Nor washeaware how thisweak- ened him, alienating friends andallies, andgiving theChurch, in addition tothespiritual authority which gives itsway, somuch political power. Having made oneerror, hehadtocommit an- other. Namely, tohold back Alexander's ambition andprevent himfrom becoming Lord ofTuscany, Louis hadtoenter Italy. It wasn't enough toaggrandize theChurch andoffend hisfriends, but,outofhisambitions fortheKingdom ofNaples, hedivided it with theKing ofSpain. Instead ofremaining arbiter ofItaly, he putinapartner towhom theambitious anddiscontent ones of thatprovince could turn. When hecould have appointed ade- pendent ofhisown there, heremoved oneandputinsomeone who could turnagainst him. Itisquite natural andordinary fora Prince towant toexpand hisrule, andwhen they do,ifthey can, theyarepraised andnotblamed. Butwhen theyareunsuccessful, butstillwant todoit,here liestheerror andthefault. IfFrance hadthepower totake Naples, fine; ifnot,itshouldn't have di 38— Niccolò Machiavelli vided it.Dividing Lombardy with theVenetians merits excuses because itgained France afoothold inItaly; buttheagenda in Naples merits blame because itdidnothave thisexcuse. Louis therefore made these fivemistakes: helostsupport among the minor lords; hegave more power toanalready powerful ruler; he putapowerful foreign potentate in;hedidn't come tolivethere; andhedidn't plant colonies.
