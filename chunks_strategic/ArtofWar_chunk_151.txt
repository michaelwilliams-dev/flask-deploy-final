fighting. JIA LIN Best of all is when your troops are held in such awe that everyone comes to surrender. This is preferable to winning by trickery, violence, and slaughter. MEI YAOCHEN This is a matter of disliking to inflict injury. ZHANG YU If you can only prevail after doing battle, there will surely be many casualties, so this is not good. If you make it clear what is to be rewarded and what punished, make your directives reliable, keep your machines in good repair, train and exercise your officers and troops, and let their strengths be known so as to overcome the opponent psychologically, this is considered very good. WANG XI In military operations, what is valued is foiling the opponent�s strategy, not pitched battle. HO YANXI Ho Yanxi related this story: When Wang Po of the latter Han dynasty struck Chu Chien and Su Mo, he returned to camp after battle. His enemies regrouped and tried to provoke another skirmish, but Wang Po refused to come out. As Wang Po was having a dinner party with his officers, Su Mo�s men showered the camp with a rain of arrows. One of them even struck the wine keg in front of Wang Po.

WANG XI It is best to thwart people by intelligent planning. HO YANXI When the enemy begins to plot an attack against you, you first attack them�this is easy. Figure out the direction of the enemy�s plans and deploy your forces accordingly, attacking at the outset of their intentions. ZHANG YU Zhang Yu noted that some say that what Master Sun was saying here was that the best military operation is to attack strategically, meaning to use unusual tactics and secret calculations to seize victory without even battling. Master Sun The next best is to attack alliances. LI QUAN This means attacking when alliance are first established. CHEN HAO Some say this means that
