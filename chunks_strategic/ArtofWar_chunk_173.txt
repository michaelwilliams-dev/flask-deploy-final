LI QUAN Determining changes as appropriate, do not repeat former strategies to gain victory. DU MU Whatever formations opponents may adopt, from the beginning I can adapt to them to attain victory. Master Sun Military formation is like water�the form of water is to avoid the high and go to the low, the form of a military force is to avoid the full and attack the empty; the flow of water is determined by the earth, the victory of a military force is determined by the opponent.

Master Sun The difficulty of armed struggle is to make long distances near and make problems into advantages. CAO CAO While giving the appearance of being far away, you step up your pace and get there before the opponent. DU MU Fool opponents into taking it easy, then make haste. Master Sun Therefore you make their route a long one, luring them on in hopes of gain. When you set out after others and arrive before them, you know the strategy of making the distant near. JIA LIN When the opponent really has but a short way to go, if you can lengthen his road by sending him on wild goose chases, you can mislead him so that he cannot come to you to fight. HO YANXI You use a special squad to lure the opponent on a wild goose chase, making it seem as though your main force is far away; then you send out a
