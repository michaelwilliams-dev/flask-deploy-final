cityanddoesnotshare thecharacter ofthecity inwhich helives. (Even thedemocratic man isnotthepoor, lean citizen described bySocrates when hespoke ofthedemocratic city.)The various kinds ofsoulcanapparently reach their fulfillment ontheir ov^Ti inademocratic city;they arenotencouraged by it,norarethey hindered by it.Socrates describes democracy asageneral storestocked with allkinds ofregimes; hefollows hisownsuggestion andgoes tothat storewhen hewants toselect thevarious kinds ofmen.Athens iswhere onehastoliveinorder toknow therange ofhuman possibilities. The onlytypehecannot findthere isthetyrant actualizing hispotential, but there isayoungmanpresent inthediscussion whomight well liketobe one.Thechange fromonekind ofman tothenextandlower kind is understood bySocrates asafailure ofeducation within thefamily. Itis ineach case asuperior fatherwho isunable tomake hissonlikehim- self.And here, asopposed tothediscussion oftheregimes, the changes inthecrucial instances areinpartcaused bywhatmight be called problems offoreign policy. The cities were isolated, andtheir difficulties arose outoftherelations oftheparts within them. Butthe aristocratic andtimocratic menhave difficulties intheir relations with thecity,andbecause oftheunsatisfactory character ofthose relations, thesons reject thefathers' ways oflifeinfavor ofwayswhich aremore suited tosuccess inthecity.Thus theybecome inferior men. Socrates appears tobeteaching thatthefatal error consists intaking thecitytoo seriously andadapting toitsdemands, thus thatmenneed notbelike theregimes, thattheregimes need notbetheprimary factoftheir lives, particularly ifthey liveinademocracy. Thegood city's corruption wasmysterious andshrouded inmyth; thevery existence ofthat citywasquestionable. Theonlynonmythical account onecangiveofitisthatdrawn from acomparison with the causes ofthecorruption oftheinferior regimes: thepreoccupation with theacquisition ofproperty andthedifficulties involved initsdistribu- tionmake itimpossible forthecitytodevote itself tothegood^ useof thatproperty or,simply, tothegood life.Thebody cannot beforgot- ten,andthus itisimpossible torenounce everything connected with private property andconcentrate onlyonthesoul.Thepossession of private property isthecrucial change from thebestregime tothesecond best,and allthe illswhich beset thevarious regimes follow from that change. The city's primary business becomes themanagement ofprop- ertyand is,hence, thededication tomere life. Itisnoaccident that in [419 ] THEREPUBLIC the listofregimes thecentral one isoligarchy, forinitspursuit of money, itincarnates theconcern ofthereal city.Theprivate desires whichmoney represents andcan fulfillandwhich areatatension with public spiritbecome moreandmore dominant asonegoesdown the slope oftheregimes. Socrates indicates thatbecause acity isacomposite ofmany kinds ofmen, ofwhom veryfewarecapable oflove of knowledge, nocitycanavoid thefiindamental compromise vidth private property. Thecorruption ofthearistocrat's son,ontheother hand, canbe seenbyall.Unlike thearistocratic city,thearistocratic man really ex- ists;he isaphilosopher. Moreover, heisexactly like Socrates. He devotes himself tolearning; heistotally indifferent tohisbody and other men's opinions ofhim;heisutterly dedicated andsingle-minded. Buthiswife, likeXanthippe, cannot endure thefactthatherhusband, andthereby sheherself, isunhonored anddespised. She,along with other like-minded people, convinces hissonthat this isnoway tolive. Sheechoes Callicles, who intheGorgias accused thephilosopher of being unmanly, ofbeing incapable ofhonorably avenging insults. Man's fallfrom thestate ofinnocence isaresult ofawoman's tempt- ings.Theson's spiritedness isawakened, andhelives thelifeofaproud man, performing those deeds which willmakehimrespected byothers. Such alifeentails theabandonment ofphilosophy, bothbecause heno longer hastime for itandbecause thequestions raised byitarenotap- propriate toagentleman. Henow lives fortheopinions ofothermen andnolonger forhimself. Hisfather wasnottruly acitizenâ€” hewas in thecitybutnotofit;butthat father's sonbecomes apartofthecityby adapting himself toit. The timocrat's son, inturn, iscorrupted when hesees hisfather mistreated bythepeople. Hewastooproud tocourt thepeople andlost everything. Fearbecomes theson's motivation; heabandons pride, for itisdangerous. Hisfather wasspiritually dependent onthepeople; his condemnation ruins his life.Thesonrecognizes thatthefather's ap- parent independence wasgroundless. Now life,bodily life,becomes dom- inant. Theonly source ofsecurity isinmoney which canguarantee themeans oflife.Thefather hadmoney anddidnotpay sufficient at- tention totheneedhehad for it.Spiritedness cannot maintain itself against thisawareness. Theson iscompletely dependent onthings out- sidehimself, anddesire hasbecome theprinciple ofhis life.Theexam- pleofSocrates teaches that aman should live inthecity like a sovereign nation unto himself, withonlysuch
