"Plainly youmean things thatappear from far ofiF,"hesaid, "and shadow paintings." "Youhave hardly gotmymeaning," Isaid. "Then, whatdoyoumean?" hesaid. "The ones thatdon'tsummon theintellect," Isaid, "are allthose c thatdon't atthesame time goover totheopposite sensation. Butthe ones thatdogoover 1classamong those thatsummon the intellect, when thesensation doesn't reveal onething anymore than itsopposite, regardless ofwhether theobject strikes thesenses from near orfar off. Butyou willseemymeaning more clearly thisway: these, we say, would bethree fingersâ€”thesmallest, thesecond, andthemiddle."^i "Certainly," hesaid. "Think ofthem while I'mspeaking asiftheywerebeing seenupclose. Nowconsider thisaboutthem forme." "What?" "Surely each ofthem looks equally like afinger, and inthis d respect itmakes nodifference whether it'sseen inthemiddle oronthe extremes, whether it'swhite orblack, orwhether it'sthick orthin, or anything elseofthesort. Inallthese things thesoulofthemany isnot compelled toasktheintellect what afinger is.Forthesight atnopoint indicates tothesoul thatthefinger isatthesame time theopposite ofa finger." "No," hesaid, "itdoesn't." "Then,"1said, "itisn't likely thatanything ofthesortwould be e apttosummon orawaken theactivity ofintellect." "No, it'snotlikely." "Now what about this?Does thesight seetheir bigness and Ht- tleness adequately, anddoes itmake nodifference toitwhether afinger hesinthemiddle orontheextremes? And similarly withthetouch, for thickness andthinness orsoftness andhardness? Anddotheother senses reveal such things without insufficiency? Ordoesn't each of 524athem dothefollowing: first, thesense setover thehard isalsocom- pelled tobesetover the soft;and itreports tothesoul thatthesame thing issensed byitasbothhardandsoft?" [202 ] BookVll/523a-524d glaucon/socrate "So itdoes,"' hesaid. 524, "Isn't itnecessary," Isaid, "that insuch cases thesoulbeataloss astowhat thissensation indicates bythehard, ifitsaysthatthesame thing isalso soft,andwhat thesensation ofthelightandoftheheavy indicates bythelightandheavy, ifitindicates thattheheavy islight andthelightheavy?" "Yes, indeed," hesaid, "these arestrange interpretations received bythesoulandrequire further consideration." "Therefore," Isaid, "it's likely that insuch cases asoul,sum- moning calculation and intellect, first tries todetermine whether each ofthethings reported toitisoneortwo." "Ofcourse." "If itappears tobetwo,won't each ofthetwoappear tobedif- ferent andtobeone?" "Yes." "Then, ifeach isoneandboth two,thesoulwillthink thetwoas separate. For itwould notthink theinseparable astwobutasone." "Right." "But sight, too,sawbigand little,wesay,notseparated, however, butmixed uptogether. Isn't that so?" "Yes." "Inorder toclear thisuptheintellect wascompelled toseebig and little, too,notmixed uptogether butdistinguished, doing theop- posite ofwhat thesight did." Irue. "Isn't itfromhere that itfirstoccurs toustoaskwhat thebigand the little are?" "That's entirely certain." "And so, itwasonthisground thatwecalled theoneintelligible andtheother visible." "Quite right," hesaid. "Well, then, thiswaswhat Iwasjusttrying toconvey insaying thatsome things areapttosummon thought, while others arenot, defining asapttosummon itthose thatstrike thesense atthesame time astheir opposites, while allthose thatdonot,arenotapttoarouse in- tellection." "Well, now Iunderstand," hesaid,"and inmyopinion itisso." "What then?Towhich ofthetwodonumber andtheoneseem to belong?" "Ican't conceive," hesaid. "Figure itoutonthebasis ofwhat was said before," Isaid. "For iftheone isadequately seen, itselfbyitself, orisgrasped by [203 ] SOCRAWGI..CON THEREPUBLIC 524e some other sense, itwould notdrawmentoward being, aswewere saying about thefinger.
