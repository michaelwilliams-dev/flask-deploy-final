"That's so,"hesaid. "And ourguardian isboth warrior andphilosopher." "Certainly." "Then itwould befitting, Glaucon, tosetthisstudydown inlaw and topersuade thosewho aregoing toparticipate inthegreatest c things inthecitytogotocalculation andtotake itup,notafter the fashion ofprivate men, buttostaywith ituntil theycome tothecon- templation ofthenature ofnumbers with intellection itself, notpractic- ing itforthesakeofbuying andselling likemerchants ortradesmen, butforwarandforeaseofturning thesoul itselfaround frombecom- ingtotruthandbeing." "What yousay isvery fine," hesaid.

"Inwhatway?" hesaid. [204 ] Book VII 1524c-526e socrates/gi^ucon "Intheverywaywewere justnow saying. Itleads thesoulpower- 525d fullyupward andcompels ittodiscuss numbers themselves.

Ifintheargument someone attempts tocut theone itself, theylaugh andwon't permit it.Ifyou trytobreak itup e intosmall coin, they multiply, taking good care against theone's ever looking like itwere notonebutmany pieces." "What yousay isvery true,"hesaid. "What, Glaucon, doyou suppose, would happen ifsomeone 526a were toaskthem, 'you surprising men, what sort ofnumbers are you discussing, inwhich theone isasyour axiom claims ittobe— eachoneequal toevery other one, without the slightest difference between them, andcontaining noparts within itself?' What doyou suppose theywould answer?" "Isuppose theywould answer thatthey aretalking about those numbers thatadmit only ofbeing thought andcanbegrasped inno other way." "Doyou see, then,myfriend,"Isaid, "that it'slikely that this b study isreally compulsory forus,since itevidently compels thesoul tousetheintellect itselfonthetruth itself?" "Itmost certainly doesdothat,"hesaid. "What about this?Have you already observed thatmenwho arebynature apt atcalculation arenaturally quick invirtually all studies, while thosewho areslow, ifthey areeducated andgiven gymnastic in it, allmake progress bybecoming quicker than they were, even iftheyarebenefited innootherway?" "That's so,"hesaid. "And, further, Idon't suppose youwould easily findmany studies c thattakegreater effort inthelearning andinthepractice than this." "Certainly not." "Then, forallthese reasons thisstudy shouldn't beneglected, and thebestnatures mustbeeducated init." "Ijoinmyvoice toyours,"hesaid. "Therefore wehave settled onthisone,"Isaid."And let'scon- siderwhether thestudy adjpining thisone isinanyway suitable." "What isit?"hesaid."Ordoyoumean geometry?" "That's exactly it,"Isaid. "Asmuch of itasapplies tothebusiness ofwar isplainly d suitable," hesaid. "Inpitching camp, assaulting places, gathering the army together anddrawing itupinline,and inallother maneuvers ar- [205 ] slaucon/socrates theREPUBLIq 526dmiesmake inthebattle itselfandonmarches, itwould make quite a difference toamanwhether hewere skilled ingeometry ornot." "However," 1said, "for such things only asmall portionof geometry— asofcalculation—^would sufiRce.

Andwesaythat thistendencyis possessed byeverything thatcompels thesoul toturnaround tothe region inhabited bythehappiest partofwhat is,which iswhat thesoul mustbyallmeans see." "What yousay isright," hesaid. "Then ifgeometry compels onetolook atbeing, itissuitable; ifat becoming, itisnotsuitable." "That iswhatweaffirm." 527a "Well, then," Isaid,"none ofthosewhohave even alittle ex- perience withgeometry willdispute itwith us:thiskind ofknowledge isexactly theopposite ofwhat issaidabout itinthearguments ofthose whotake itup." "How?" hesaid. "Inthatthey surely speak inaway that isasridiculous asitis necessary. They speak asthough theyweremenofaction andweremaking allthearguments forthesakeofaction, uttering sounds like squaring,' 'applying,' 'adding,' andeverything ofthesort,whereas thewhole study is b surely pursued forthesakeofknovving." "That's entirely certain," hesaid. "Mustn't wealsocome toanagreement about the following point?" "What?" "That
