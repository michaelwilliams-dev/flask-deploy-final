, he was disappointed . Machiavelli wrote The Prince in 1513 , but it was not printed until nearly twenty years later. It had, however, already been cir- it quickly became known as a remark.able exposition of statecraft, expressed in terse and vigorous culated in manuscript, and THE PRINCE � 21 prose, and showing exceptional powers of observation and origi.nality of thought. Machiavelli was also writing the Discourses upon the First Decade of Livy the same time as The Prince, at and he began The Art of War soon afterwards. These three books are complementary to each other, working out different aspects of the same problem. In the Discourses he reviewed various forms of government, but treated principally of republics; in The Prince he was mainly occupied with the qualities necessary for the ruler of new state and the methods of government that he should em.ploy, a matter only briefly dealt with in the Discourses; while in The Art of War he elaborated his ideas as to the need of a national militia to support either prince or republic, as to the methods of its formation and training, and as to the principles of tactical war.fare.

Although written with special reference to the condition of Italy at the time, and with the object of stirring 22� Niccol� Machiavelli up Italians to face the problems confronting them, it is, of course, the more general application of the principles laid down in the book which has made it of permanent importance, and which has to led to so much violent criticism even the point of attacks on Machiavelli�s personal character. in Much of the conduct cited with approval this work and many of the methods recommended are obviously immoral when judged by present-day standards,
