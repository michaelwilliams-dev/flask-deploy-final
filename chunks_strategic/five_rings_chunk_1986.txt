with the good ofthe art's object, butrather with thegood ofthepractitioner. After all,thewage earner doesnotcare forthewell-being ofmoney, he cares forhisownwell-being. Moreover, there being nopre-established harmony between thetwoartspracticed byaman, there isevery prob- ability ofthere being conflicts between theirdemands. Forexample, what isthedoctor todowho isoffered abribe forharming hispatient? Histwo artseachmake rigorous andcontradictory claims upon him, andthere isnoevident principle forchoosing which should bepre- ferred. Socrates makes thisexplicit whenhetellsGlaucon thatwagesmust always bepaid topolitical men,andthatthere isaperpetual conflict [332 ] Interpretive Essay between their interests aswage earners and their interests asgood rulers. Thetension between thepubhc goodandprivate good ofthein- dividual which Socrates hadexplicitly denied isadmitted with thisin- troduction ofthewage-earner's art.Thrasymachus, however, isnot quick enough tonotice thisandtakeadvantage ofit. Thiswage-earner's art isubiquitous. Itaccompanies allofthearts anddirects their action. Itisthusanarchitectonic art.Contrary toSoc- rates' argument thateach artiscomplete andperfect initself, needing nothing beyond itself, asuper art isnecessaiy tosupplement allthe arts.Fortheymustberelated toeach otherandtothewhole ofwhich their subject matters areapart.The cai-penter's, bricklayer's, and plasterer's artsarenotsufficient unto themselves; theymustbeguided bythearchitect's art.Money, orwhatwewould calltheeconomic system, isasortofarchitectonic principle; forinordinary cities the amount ofmoney paid fortheproducts oftheartsdetermines what arts arepracticed, howthey arepracticed, andwhat kind ofmenpractice them.Money isthecommon denominator running through allthearts; itseems toestablish their value andprovides themotivation forprac- ticing them. Thrasymachus, who isseeking students inAthens, issurely apartofthissystem. Hisrhetoric isofusetohimonly ifpeople desire itandarewilling topayforlearning it. Socrates, bymeans ofthisfabrication ofanartofwage earning, points, ashedidinthediscussion withPolemarchus, totheneed fora master arttosupplement theother arts.Money ismanifestly aninade- quate architectonic orregal principle, and itsinadequacies serve toin- dicate what atruearchitectonic artwould have tobeandaccomplish. Money cannot discern thenature ofeach oftheartsnorevaluate the contribution their products make tohappiness; theprice paid forthe sei^vices ofthearts ismerely thereflection ofthevmtutored tastes ofthe many ortherich.Money constitutes anartificial system which subor- dinates thehigher tothelower.Andthemanwhoserves formoney be- comes theslave ofthemost authoritative voices ofhisowntimeand place, while renouncing theattempt toknow, andliveaccording to,the natural hierarchy ofvalue.He isalways tornbetween thedemands of hisartandtheneeds ofthemarketplace. Thewage-earner's art isakind ofpolitical substitute forphiloso- phy.Theintention ofphilosophy istounderstand thenature ofthearts andorder them toward theproduction ofhiunan happiness, and to educate men todesire those things which mostconduce tohappiness. It canclaim torule alltheartsfor italone tries toknow thewhole, the truewhole, asopposed to*^heview ofthewhole ofthistime orplace, and itrestores theunity toamainVlife. Itdemands total dedication to [333 ] THEREPUBLIC itsobjects, aswasrequired ofthearts,while giving ample reward toits practitioner inthat itistheperfection ofhisnature and hisgreatest satisfaction. Only inphilosophy isthere anidentity oftheconcern for theproper practice oftheartandthat forone'sownadvantage. Soc- rates embodies asolution totheconflicting demands which render Thrasymachus' lifemeaningless: Socrates combines inasinglewayof lifethesatisfactions ofthelover ofknowledge andthelover ofgain. All other lives areessentially self-contradictory. Inthephilosopher wecan findboth thepublic-spirited rulerandthesatisfied man. Thus Socrates, whose explicit intention wastoshow thattheprac- titioners ofarts—andhence Thrasymachus' rulers— cannot becon- cerned with theirownadvantage, has,bytheintroduction ofthewage- earner's art,tacitly admitted thenecessity andlegitimacy ofthatcon- cern.Hehasonlyshown thatmencannot consistently atthesame time beboth rulers intheprecise sense defined byThrasymachus and seekers oftheirownadvantage, while hinting thatphilosophy isthe only resolution oftheconflict between artorscience and self-interest. As itappears toThrasymachus, Socrates ismadly insisting thataman spend hislifeintotal dedication toothers without anyreason forso doing andinblind indifference tothefacts oflife.Thrasymachus cannot defend hisposition because ofhisearlier assertions, andheisprevented bythem frommaking hispowerful appeal tomen's lustandtheir re- spect forknowledge. Hisdefinition ofjustice astheadvantage ofthe stronger fails,butonlybecause hisdefinition oftheruler isindefensible. Hesees thisasaresult ofhaving become entangled inSocrates' dishon- estarguments.
