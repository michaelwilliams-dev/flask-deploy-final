in a way thaf s helpful for what we are talking about?" "As follows," I said. "These decorations in the heaven, since they are embroidered on a visible ceiling, may be believed to be the fairest and most precise of such things; but they fall far short of the true ones, those movements in which the really fast and the really slow-in true number and in all the true figures-are moved with respect to one another and in their tum move what is contained in them. They, of course, must be grasped by argument and thought, not sight. Or do you suppose otherwise?" "Not at all," he said. "Therefore," I said, "the decoration in the heaven must be used as patterns for the sake of learning these other things, just as if one were to come upon diagrams exceptionally carefully drawn and worked out by Daedalus or some other craftsman or painter. A man experienced in geometry would, on seeing such things, presumably believe that they are fairest in their execution but that it is ridiculous to consider them seriously as though one were to grasp the truth about equals, doubles, or any other proportion in them." "How could it be anything but ridiculous?" he said. "Then," I said, "don't you suppose that a man who is really an as- . tronomer will have the same persuasion in looking at the movements of the stars? He will hold that the craftsman18 of heaven composed it ��and whafs in it as beautifully as such works can be composed. But as , for the proportion of night to day, of these to a month, of a month to a ��. year, and of the rest of the stars to these and to one another, don't you , think he will consider strange the man who holds that these are always , the same and deviate in no way at all? For these things are connected with body and are visible. Hence won't he consider it strange to seek in i: every way to grasp their truth?" "That is my opinion," he said, "at least now that I am listening to f you." "Therefore," I said, "by the use of problems, as in geometry, we J shall also pursue astronomy; and we shall let the things in the heaven j:rgo, if by really taking part in astronomy we are going to convert the :;, prudence by nature in the oul from uselessness to usefulness." 529 C d e 530a b C 't.-.', "The task you prescribe," he said, "is many times greater than S: what is now done in astronomy." j; "And," I said, "I suppose our prescriptions in the rest will also be ?� of the same kind, if we are to be of any help as lawgivers. But have you any suitable study to suggest?" [ zog ] GLAUCON/SOCRATES THE REPUBtJc I j 530c "No, I haven't ,,h . "Howeve, r " I 'sa1_de s"aid, ". at least not right now.".
