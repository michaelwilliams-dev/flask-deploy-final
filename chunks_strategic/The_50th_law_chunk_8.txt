noticed in the rap world. He was still a very young man when he had faced down some of the worst fears that can afflict a human�abandonment, violence, radical change�and he had emerged stronger and more resilient. But at the age of twenty-four, on the eve of the release of his first record, he came face-toface with what many of us would consider the ultimate fear�that of death itself. In May of 2000 an assassin poured nine bullets into him in broad daylight as he sat in a car outside his house, one bullet going through his jaw and coming within a millimeter of killing him. In the aftermath of the shooting, Columbia Records dropped him from the label, canceling the release of his first album. He was quickly blackballed from the industry, as record executives were afraid to have any kind of involvement with him and the violence he was associated with. Many of his friends turned against him, perhaps sensing his weakness. He now had no money; he couldn�t really return to hustling after turning his back on it, and his music career seemed to be over. This was one of those turning points that reveals the power of one�s attitude in the face of adversity. It was as if he were confronting the impassable Alps.

He would not waste a second. He would spurn the usual path to success�working within the record industry, nabbing that golden deal, and putting out the music they thought would sell. He would go his own way�launching a mix-tape campaign in which he would sell his music or give it away for free on the streets. In this way he could hone the hard and raw sounds that he felt were more natural to him. He could speak the language of the hood without having to soften it at all. Suddenly he felt a great sense of freedom�he could create his own business model, be as unconventional as he desired. He felt like he had nothing to lose, as if the last bits of fear that still remained within him had bled out in the car that day in 2000. The mix-tape campaign made him famous on the streets and caught the attention of Eminem, who quickly signed Fifty to his and Dr. Dre�s label, setting the stage for Fifty�s meteoric rise to the top of the music world in 2003, and the subsequent creation of the business empire he has forged since. We are living through strange, revolutionary times. The old order is crumbling before our eyes on so many levels. And yet in such an unruly moment, our leaders in business and politics cling to the past and the old ways of doing things. They are afraid of change and any kind of disorder.
