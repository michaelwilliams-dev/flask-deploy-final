relations toother citizens asaredictated byadefensive prudence. Inorder toshowhow thisoligarchic man's sonbecomes ademo- cratic man, Socrates makes adistinction between thenecessary and [420] Interpretive Essay unnecessary desires, which explains thedifference between theoligarch andthedemocrat. Thenecessary desires arethosewhich contribute to themaintenance oflife;theunnecessary ones arethose thatwecould dowithout. Socrates appears toinclude even sexinthislatter category. Presumably because ofhisfather's success atproviding money, the democratic sonhasdevoted himself tomany desires andnotlimited himself tothenecessary ones asdidhisaustere father.Onthebasis of Socrates' description, itisnotatallclearwhy thedemocratic son should beconsidered inferior tohisoligarchic fatherwhohasspent his lifepursuing money, despoiling others. Theyoung democrat seems to bearather charming, ifaimless, fellow. Itiseasy toseewhyademo- cratic regime might wellbeconsidered inferior toanoligarchic one, butthiswould only serve toshow thedifference between thesolid life ofthecityandtheagreeable lifeofman. Neither theoligarchic nor democratic regime orman isdevoted toanyvirtue, but atleast the democratic man's principle doesnotpreclude thepractice ofvirtue. As hasbeen observed, thisjudgment against thedemocratic man ispartof ageneral condemnation ofdesire leading tothecondemnation ofthe tyrant, who istaken tobethemanofdesire. Thedesires areinterpreted asthebodily desires which, when emancipated, areinfinite andmake man's needs infinite. Their moderation isnecessary both forpolitical stability andforthepossibility ofphilosophizing. Forthemany, the praise ofdesire isthepraise ofbodily desire, and thismustbecon- trolled forthesake ofbothphilosophy and politics. But this isonly apartial account, foramong theobjects thatthe disorganized democrat pursues, onthesame level asflute-playing and dieting, isphilosophy. Tohim itisnotaserious occupation, but democracy isnevertheless theonlyoneofthepracticable regimes in which philosophy makes anappearance. Democracy ismerely indif- ferent tophilosophy, while theother regimes arepositively hostile toit. Themoral orfiscal austerity oftimocracy andoligarchy preclude the leisure necessary tophilosophy andcondemn thethought produced by it;atthesame time, lifeinthese regimes istooorganized forphiloso- phy tobeable toescape unnoticed forlong.And thetyrant is frightened bythewiseandfree-minded. Philosophy isamong theun- necessary desires andhence finds itshome indemocracy. Timocracy, thebest practicable regime, istheregime furthest removed from philosophy; paradoxically, Socrates thecitizen praises timocracy, while Socrates thephilosopher desires democracy. He isactually engaged ina defense ofdemocracy against itsenemies, thepotential tyrants andthe lovers ofSparta, notbecause hecanbededicated todemocracy butpre- cisely because itdoesnotdemand dedication. Aftershowing theimpos- sibility, andperhaps theundesir ability, ofaregime towhich hecouldbe [421 ] THEREPUBLIC dedicated, heprogressively abandons itinfavor oftheregime which leaves him free,theonly realregime inwhich hecanprosper. Socrates' harsh andapparently insensitive criticism oftragedy asa servant ofdemocracy, andparticularly oftyranny, ispartofthesame condemnation ofdesire which leadshim inthiscontext toprefer the oligarch tothedemocrat. Tragedy isindeed thetaste ofdemocracies andtyrannies, asopposed totimocracies and oligarchies. The other cities aretoobusy todevelop such tastes andconsider them adanger to moral virtue ortosound economics. Tragedy requires theemancipation of,andtheappeal to,desires which aredenied orsuppressed inthe other regimes. Tragedy, therefore, encourages those desires andmust becondemned insofar asthose regimes areinferior. But ifdemocracy andtyranny contain elements ofhumanity lacking inother regimes, tragedy's alliance withthemmaybepartially justified. Specifically, the very desires which existed butweredenied toexist inother regimes are thethemes oftragedy .Thus, tragedy canboth learnandteach aboutman intheinferior regimes where these desires arepermitted. Inonesense, it isamistake togivewaytothese desires, buttoturnone'sbackonthem is tomisunderstand man.And thesuppression ofthese desires isallied with thesuppression ofphilosophy. Just asphilosophy isunnecessary, soispoetry. Therealquarrel withtragedy doesnotconcern itsimplicit rejection oftheself-control requisite totimocracy andoligarchy, but rather theabsence in'itofanyknowledge ofthetruearistocracy and, because itlacks thatcounterpoise, theconsequent inclination totake thedesires andpassions tooseriously. This criticism ofpoetry inBook VIIIprepares theway forthere-examination ofphilosophy's powerful opponent inBook X. {571a~592b) AtlastSocrates comes tohisdescription ofthe tyrant.
