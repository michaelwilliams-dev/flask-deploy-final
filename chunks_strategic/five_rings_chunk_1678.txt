Catherine was thedaughterofKing Ferdinand andQueenIsabella of Spain,andbymarrying herHenry hadkeptalive avaluable alliance. Now, however, Catherine had toassure him that herbrief marriagewith Arthur had never been consummated. Otherwise Henrywould view their rela- tionshipasincestuous and their marriageasnull and void.

Henry notonly ignored thisthreat, heinsisted that hismarriagetoCatherine had been dissolved, and in1533 hemarried Anne Boleyn. Clement refused torecognize themarriage, butHenrydid not care.
