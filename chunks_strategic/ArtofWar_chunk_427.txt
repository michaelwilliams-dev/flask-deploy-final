and arrows, spears and shields, protective mantles, draught-oxen and heavy wagons, will amount to four-tenths of its total rev- enue. 15. Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy. One cart- load of the enemy�s provisions is equivalent to twenty of one�s own, and likewise a single PICUL of his provender is equivalent to twenty from one�s own store. [Because twenty cartloads will be consumed in the process of transporting one cartload to the front. A PICUL is a unit of measure equal to 133.3 pounds (65.5 kilograms).] 15. Now in order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused to anger; that there may be advantage from defeating the enemy, they must have their rewards. [Tu Mu says: "Rewards are necessary in order to make the soldiers see the advantage of beating the enemy; thus, when you capture spoils from the enemy, they must be used as rewards, so that all your men may have a keen desire to fight, each on his own account."] 15. Therefore in chariot fighting, when ten or more chariots have been taken, those should be rewarded who took the first. Our own flags should be substituted for those of the enemy, and the chariots mingled and used in conjunction with ours. The captured soldiers should be kindly treated and kept. 16. This is called, using the conquered foe to augment one�s own strength. 17. In war, then, let your great object be victory, not lengthy campaigns. [As Ho Shih remarks: "War is not a thing to be trifled with." Sun Tzu here reiterates the main lesson which this chapter is intended to enforce."] 15. Thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter of the people�s fate, the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall be in peace or in peril. Chapter 4 ATTACK BY STRATAGEM 1. Sun Tzu said: In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy�s country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good. So, too, it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them. [The equivalent to an army corps, according to Ssu-ma Fa, consisted nom- inally of 12500 men; according to Ts�ao Kung, the equivalent of a regi- ment contained 500 men, the equivalent to a detachment consists from any number between 100 and 500, and the equivalent of a company contains from 5 to 100 men. For the last two, however, Chang Yu gives the exact figures of 100 and 5 respectively.] 1. Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy�s resistance without fighting. [Here again, no modern strategist but will approve the words of the old Chinese general. Moltke�s greatest triumph, the capitulation of the huge French army at Sedan, was won practically without
