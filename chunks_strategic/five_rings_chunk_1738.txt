Itwas now Cromwell’s turn towatch uneasilyastheking began slowlytoundo hisreforms, reinstating Catholic sacraments and other ritu- alsthat Cromwell had outlawed. Sensinghisfall fromgrace,in1540 Cromwell decided toregain Henry’sfavor with one throw ofthedice: Hewould End thekinganew wife. Henry’s third wife, Jane Seymour,had died afewyears before, and hehad been piningfor anewyoung queen.Itwas Cromwell who found him one: Anne ofCleves, aGerman princess and, most importantto Cromwell, aProtestant. OnCrornwell’s commission, thepainterHolbein producedaflattering portraitofAnne; when Henrysaw it,hefellinlove, andagreedtomarryher. Cromwell seemed back infavor. Unfortunately, however, Holbein’spaintingwashighly idealized, and when thekingfinallymet theprincessshedid notpleasehim intheleast. Hisanger againstCromwell—f1rst fortheill~conceived reforms, now for saddlinghim with anunattractive and Protestant wife-—could nolongerbe contained. InJuneofthatyear,Cromwell wasarrested, chargedasaProtes- tant extremist and aheretic, and sent totheTower. Sixweeks later, before a largeand enthusiastic crowd, thepublicexecutioner cutoffhishead. Interpretation Thomas Cromwell had asimpleidea: Hewould breakupthepowerand wealth oftheChurch andlaythefoundation forProtestantism inEngland. And hewould dothis in a.mercilesslyshort time. Heknew hisspeedyre- forms would cause painand resentment, but hethoughtthese feelings would fade inafewyears.More important, byidentifyinghimself with change,hewould become theleader ofthe new order, makingtheking de pendentonhim. But there was aprobleminhisstrategy:Like abilliard ballhittoohard against thecushion, hisreforms had reactions and caroms hedid notenvision and could notcontrol. The man who initiates strongreforms often becomes thescapegoatfor anykind ofdissatisfaction. And eventuallythereaction tohisreformsmay consume him, forchangeisupsettingtothehuman animal, even when itis forthegood.Because theworld isandalwayshas been fullofinsecurity andthreat, welatch ontofamiliar faces and create habits and rituals to make theworld more comfortable. Changecan bepleasantand even sometimes desirable intheabstract, but toomuch ofitcreates ananxiety thatwill stirandboil beneath thesurface and then eventually erupt. Never underestimate thehidden conservatism ofthose aroundyou.It ispowerfuland entrenched.

OFTHE LAW As ayoungCommunist inthe19203, Mao Tsetung understood better than any ofhiscolleaguestheincredible odds againstaCommunist victoryin China. With their small numbers, limited funds, lack ofmilitary experi- ence, and small arsenal ofweapons,theParty had nohope ofsuccess un- less itwon over China’s immense peasant population. But who inthe world was more conservative, more rooted intradition, than theChinese peasantry?The oldest civilization ontheplanethad ahistorythat would never loosen itspower,nomatter how violent therevolution. The ideas of Confucius remained asalive inthe 19203 astheyhad been inthesixth cen- tury B.C., when thephilosopherwas alive, Despitetheoppressions ofthe current system, would thepeasantryever give upthedeep~rooted values of thepast forthegreatunknown ofCommunism? The solution, asMao sawit,involved asimple deception:Cloak the revolution intheclothing ofthepast, making itcomfortingandlegitimate inpeople’s eyes.
