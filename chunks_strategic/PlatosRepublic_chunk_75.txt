"Very true," he said. "If, then, we are to preserve the first argument-that our guard? ians must give up all other crafts and very precisely be craftsmen of the city's freedom and practice nothing other than what tends to c 395 C d e 396 a b C it-they also mustn't do or imitate anything else. And if they do imitate, they must imitate what's appropriate to them from childhood: men who are courageous, moderate, ho]y, free, and everything of the sort; and what is slavish, or anything e]se shameful, they must neither do nor be clever at imitating, so that they won't get a taste for the being from its imitation. Or haven't you observed that imitations, if they are practiced continuaHy from youth onwards, become estabJished as habits and nature, in body and sounds and in thought?" "Quite so," he said. "So then," I said, "we won't allow those whom we claim we care for and who must themselves become good men to imitate wom? en-since they are men--either a young woman or an older one, or one who's abusing her husband, or one who's striving with gods and boasting because she supposes herself to be happy, or one who's caught in the grip of misfortune, mourning and waiJing.

"Nor, as it seems, bad men who are cowards and doing the op? posite of what we just now said, insulting and making fun of one another, and using shameful language, drunk or sober, or committing the other faults that such men commit against themselves and others in speeches and deeds. Nor do l suppose they should be accustomed to likening themselves to madmen in speeches or in deeds. For, although they must know both mad and worthless men and women, they must _neither do nor imitate anything of theirs." "Very true," he said. "And what about this," l said. "Should they imitate smiths at work, or men exercising any other craft, or men rowing triremes or calling time to those who do, or anything that has to do with these things?" "How could that be," he said, "since they won't even be permitted to pay attention to any of these things?" "And what about this? Horses neighing, buHs lowing, the roaring of rivers, the crashing of the sea, thunder, and everything of the sort-will they imitate them?" "But," he said, "they're forbidden to be mad or to liken them? selves to the mad." "Then, if l understand what you mean," l said, "there is a certain form of style and narrative in which the real gentleman42 narrates whenever he must say something, and, again, another form, un1ike this one, in the man who is by nature and rearing the opposite of this 391 other, always keeps and
