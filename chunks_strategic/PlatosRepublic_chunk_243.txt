is laid up for the man who wants to see and found a city within himself on the basis of what he sees. It doesn't make any difference whether it is or will be somewhere. For he would mind the things of this city alone, and of no other." "That's likely," he said. 592 b BOOKX "And, indeed," I said, "J also recognize in many other aspects of this city tha we were entirely right in the way we founded it, but I say this particularly when reflecting on poetry." "What about it?" he said. "In not admitting at all any part of it that is imitative. For that the imitative, more than anything, must not be admitted looks, in my opin? ion, even more manifest now that the soul's forms have each been separated out." "How do you mean?" "Between us-and you all won't denounce me to the tragic poets and all the other imitators-all such things seem to maim the thought of those who hear them and do not as a remedy have the knowledge of how they really are." "What are you thinking about in saying that?" he said. "It must be told," I said. "And yet, a certain friendship for Homer, and shame before him, which has possessed me since child? hood, prevents me from speaking.

"But with you present I couldn't be very eager to say whatever might occur to me, so look yourself." "Do you want us to make our consideration according to our customary procedure, beginning from the following point? For we are, presumably, accustomed to set down some one particular form for each of the particular 'manys' to which we apply the same name. Or don't you understand?" "I do." "Then let's now set down any one of the 'manys' you please; for example, if you wish, there are surely many couches and tables." "Of course;" "But as for ideas for these furnishings, there are presumably two, one of couch, one of table." "Yes � "Aren't we also accustomed to say that it is in looking to the idea of each implement that one craftsman makes the couches and another the chairs we use, and similarly for other things? For presumably none of the craftsmen fabricates the idea itself. How could he?" "In no way." "Well, now,
