isnolonger laughable. TheGreeks showed thatcivilized mencanbebothmoderate andunclad. Now theymustgoeven further andmake greater demands [381 ] THEREPUBLIC ontheirmoderation. Butdoes itmake sense tosaythat itisonlycon- vention which prohibits thepubHc association ofnakedmenandwom- en?Nakedness isforbidden because itencourages Hcentiousness, be- cause civilized menneedsome mastery over their sexual appetites. Public nakedness ispermissible where sexual desire isnotlikely tobe aroused by it.Mencanbenaked together because itisrelatively easy to desexualize their relations withoneanother; butthepreservation ofthe cityrequires themutual attraction ofmenandwomen. The citycan forbid homosexual relations, andshame andhabit canmake thevery notion inconceivable tothem. But itcannot forbid heterosexual rela- tions, andmenandwomen could hardly beexpected tobeabove at- traction tooneanother atanyparticular moment. Hence thepurpose of thegymnasia would besubverted. Lawwould atthesame time en- courage andforbid themutual attraction ofthesexes.Thecomic poets arenotwithout justification; thesexual isnecessary andmust remain private. This ispartofSocrates' attempt topoliticize theerotic, toact asthough itmade nodemands thatcannot conform tothe^blic lifeof thecity.Once more, Socrates "forgets" thebody, and thisforgetting is theprecondition oftheequality ofwomen. Asapolitical proposal, the public nakedness ofmenandwomen isnonsense. Shame isanessential component oftheerotic relations between menandwomen. Theneed forovercoming shame becomes clear inrelation towhat Socrates con- siders tobeanother form oferos— intellectual orphilosophic eros. Souls, inorder toknow, must stripaway theconventions which cover their nature. Shame prevents them fromdoing thisjustasitprevents them from stripping their bodies. Thecomic poets, because ofthis shame, areable toridicule what isnatural andthus todiscourage it. Thecomic poet istoomuch motivated byshame, forheisunaware of thekindoieros which justifies shamelessness. Inother words, thecom- icpoet willridicule philosophy just ashewillridicule lasciviousness anddosobecause both conflict withconventional demands which are enforced byshame. Thispoint isalsomadebyHomer. When theangry Haephaestus binds hisunfaithful wifeAphrodite together with her lover Aresandexposes themnaked totheother gods, allbutoneare convulsed withlaughter atthesight ButHermes saysthathewould be willing toundergo such humiliation ifhecould liewith Aphrodite. Shame cannot induce hiseros toforsake thepursuit ofthebeautiful andthegood, even ifallthegoddesses were tojointhegods inobserv- ingandlaughing athim. Ultimately, from theSocratic point ofview, Hermes isright. According toSocrates, theinstitution ofthesame practices for women asmen ispossible because itisnatural; and itisproved tobe [3«2 ] Interpretive Essay natural byarguing thatthedifference between menandwomen isno more important than thedifference between baldmenandmenwith hair.However, Socrates alsoadmits thatthebestwomen arealways in- ferior incapacity tothebestmen; itisthenhighly improbable thatany women would evenbeconsidered formembership inthehigher classes. Thus thewhole consideration oftheir education asguardians isun- necessary. Ifthefactthatwomen bear children istobeignored and doesnotplayaroleintheir selection asguardians, ifability istheonly criterion, there willnotbeasufficient number ofwomen intheguard- ianclass toreproduce it.Itisevident thatthewomen areplaced among theguardians notbecause they possess thesame capacities as themen,butprecisely because they aredifferent, because theycanbear children andthemen cannot. Totreat dissimilar persons similarly is unjust andunnatural. Maybe thesouls arethesame, buttheinfluence ofthebody ispowerful; thenecessity ofthebodymakes justice tosouls difficult. Inorder tolegitimate treating thewomen inthesameway as themen, Socrates must fabricate aconvention about thenature of women. Why thendoes Socrates insist onthesame training formenand women? Women hadhardly beenmentioned inthe firstfourbooks. Why notletthemenrunthecityandleave thewomen athome?Two reasons maybesuggested, onepolitical, theother trans-political. Inthe firstplace, neglect ofthevirtue ofwomen maybesaid tobeanother Spartan error.Menneedwomen andcaneasily becontrolled bythem. Thecharacter ofthewomen inasociety hasagreat deal todowiththe character ofthemen; forwhen themen areyoung, thewomen have a great deal todowith their rearing, andwhen theyareolder, theymust please thewomen. Inparticular, women have amore powerful attach- ment tothehome andthechildren thandomen.They areinvolved with theprivate things which arelikely tooppose the city.They characteristically donotliketosend their sons offtowar.Further, wom- enhavemuch todowith men's desire
