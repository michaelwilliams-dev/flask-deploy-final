This isone ofthe most important tasks ofaPrince . One ofthe best ordered and governed kingdoms ofour times isFrance .Here there are many constitutional guidelines onwhich the liberty and security ofthe King depend .The first ofthese is the parliament and itsauthority .The laws ofthat state ,recogniz- ing the ambitions and insolence ofpower and the nobles ,and judging itnecessary toreign them all in,and ,onthe other hand , recognizing the universal hatred ofpotentates arising from fear , the laws did not want the King todeal with this ,trying toremove the friction hewould have with the nobles ifhefavored the popu- lace ,and the friction he would have with the populace ifhe fa- vored the nobles .Sothey created athird force that without rely- ing onthe King could hold off the nobles and favor the populace . Nothing could bebetter ormore prudent nor contribute more to the security ofthe King and the Kingdom .Afurther moral can be drawn from this :namely ,that aPrince should letothers adminis- trate unpopular measures and only claim credit for popular meas- ures .Again ,aPrince should esteem the nobles but not alienate the populace . Maybe someone will object ,considering the life and death of the Roman Emperors ,that there are examples opposed tomy opinion .They will say some emperors ruled and lived exem- plararily showing great virtue who nevertheless lost their empire and were assassinated bythose who plotted against them .Since I want toanswer these charges Iwill mention the qualities ofcer- tain emperors ,showing the reason for their fall tobeinline with what Ihave said .This will put inperspective the conditions of those times .Itisenough tocite all those Emperors who suc- ceeded tothe rule ofMarcus Aurelius the Philosopher (161-180 ) up toMassimino (235-238 )—Imean Marcus ,his son Commo- dius (180-192 ),Pertinacius (193 ),Julianus (193 ),Septimus Severus (193-211 ),Caracalla (211-217 ),Macrinus (217-218 ), Eleogaballus (218-222 ),Alexander Severius (222-235 )and Mas- siminus (235-238 ). 102 - Niccolò Machiavelli The first thing tonotice isthat while other Princes have only tocontend with the ambitions ofthe nobles and the insolence of the populace ,the Roman emperors had athird difficulty :the cru- elty and avariciousness ofthe military .This was foremost inthe ruin ofPrinces .The soldiers love the warlike Prince ,one who was insolent ,cruel ,and rapacious .This often made the Prince turn against the populace topay and satisfy the avarice and cru- elty ofthe military . As aresult ,those Emperors who had ,bynature ordesign ,no great reputation could not keep one orthe other element inline . They always got ruined .Most ofthem ,especially those who rose newly toruler ,seeing this conflict ,mostly favored the soldiers , under -estimating the harm done tothe people .This was neces- sary .APrince will always behated by some one .He can try first towin
