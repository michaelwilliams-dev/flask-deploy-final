The Russians could nolonger complain ifhebehaved dictatorially-—-theyhadgivenhim thispowerthemselves. Interpretation Ivan theTenible faced aterrible dilemma: Togive intotheboyars would lead tocertain destruction, butcivil war would bringadifferent kind of ruin. Even ifIvan came outofsuch a.war ontop,thecounhywould bedev- astated and itsdivisions would bestronger than ever. Hisweaponofchoice inthepasthad been tomake abold, offensive move. Now, however, that kind ofmove would turn againsthim—the more boldlybeconfronted his enemies, the worse thereactions hewould spark. The main weakness ofashow offorce isthatitstirsupresentment and eventuallyleads toaresponsethat eats atyour authofity. Ivan, immensely creative inthe useofpower,sawclearlythat theonly pathtothekind of victoryhewanted was afalse withdrawal. Hewould notforce thecountry over tohisposition,hewould giveit“options”: either hisabdication, and certain anarchy,orhisaccession toabsolutepower.Toback uphismove, hemade itclear that hepreferredtoabdicate: “Callmybluffi” hesaid, “and watch whathappens.”No onecalled hisbluff. Bywithdrawing forjust amonth, heshowed thecountryaglimpse ofthenightmaresthat would follow hisabdication-—Taxtar invasions, civil war, ruin.

Inthis method ofcontrolling people’s options, theychoose theoption thatgives you powerbecause the alternative isjusttoounpleasant.You force their hand, butindirectly: They seem tohave achoice. Whenever peoplefeeltheyhave achoice, theywalk into your trapthat much more easily. OBSELRVANCE OFTHE LAW II As aseventeenth-centuryFrench courtesan, Ninon deLenclos found that herlifehad certain pleasures.Her lovers came from royaltyand aristoc- racy,andthey paidherwell, entertained herwith their witand intellect, satisfied herrather demandingsensual needs, and treated heralmost asan equal.Such alife wasinfinitely preferabletomarriage. In1643, however, Ninon’s mother died suddenly, leaving her, attheageoftwenty-three, to tallyalone intheworld-«no family,nodowry, nothing tofallback upon.A kind ofpanic overtook herand sheentered aconvent, tuming herback on herillustrious lovers. Ayearlater sheleftthe convent andmoved toLyons. When shefinally reappearedinParis, in1648, lovers and suitors flocked to herdoor ingreaternumbers than ever before, forshe was thewittiest and most spiritedcourtesan ofthe time and herpresence had been greatly missed. Ninon’s followers quickly discovered, however, that shehadchanged heroldway ofdoing things,and had setupanew systemofoptions.The dukes, seigneurs,andprinceswho wanted topayforher services could continue todoso,buttheywere nolongerincontrol-—she would sleep with them when shewanted, according toher whim.

Themartyrs, too,however, entertained apossibility: She would regularlyselect from them afiwori,aman who would become herlover without havingtopay, and towhom shewould abandon herself completelyfor aslongasshe so desired-—«a week, afewmonths, rarely longer.
