shown nosignofdoubt. Indeed itseemed by theend that hehad drawn outtheescapeasaway toheighten thedrama, tomake theaudience worry-—-forthere was noother sign that theperfon mance had been anythingbuteasy. The complaintabout theheat was equally partofthe act. Thespectators ofthis and other Houdini perfon mances must have felthewastoyingwith them: These manacles arenoth~ ing, heseemed tosay,Icould have freed myselfalotsooner, and from a lotworse. Over theyears, Houdini escapedfrom thechained carcass ofanem balmed “sea monster” (3.halfoctopus,half whalelike beast that had beached near Boston); hehad himself sealed inside anenormous envelope from which heemerged without breakingthepaper;hepassed through brick walls; hewriggledfree from straitjacketswhile dangling highinthe air;heleapedfrom bridges intoicywaters, hishands manacled and hislegs inchains; hehad himself submergedinglasscases fullofwater, hands pad- locked, while theaudience watched inamazement asheworked himself free, strugglingforclose toanhour apparentlywithout breathing. Each time heseemed tocourt certain death yetsurvived with superhuman aplomb. Meanwhile, hesaidnothingabout hismethods, gavenoclues as tohow beaccomplished anyofhistricks——~he lefthisaudiences and critics speculating,hispowerandreputation enhanced bytheir struggleswith the inexplicable. Perhaps themost baffling trick ofallwasmakingaten—thou- sa.ud—pound elephant disappearbefore anaudience’seyes,afeat here peatedonstagefor over nineteen weeks. No one has ever really explained how hedidthis, forintheauditorium where heperformed thetrick, there wassimplynowhere for anelephanttohide. The effortlessness ofHoudin1"sescapesled some tothink heused oc- cultforces, hissuperior psychicabilities giving himspecialcontrol over his body.But aGermanescapeartist named Kleppiniclaimed toknow Hon» dini’s secret: Hesimplyused elaborate gadgets. Kleppinialso claimed to have defeated Houdini inahandcuff challengeinHolland. Houdini didnotmind allkinds ofspeculation floating around about hismethods, but hewould nottolerate anoutright lie,and in1902 hechal- lenged Kleppinitoahandcuff duel. Kleppini accepted. Throughaspy,he found out the secret word tounlock apair ofFrench combination-lock cuffs thatHoudini liked touse. Hisplanwas tochoose these cuffs toescape from onstage.This would definitivelydebunk Houdini—his “genius” sim- plylayinhis useofmechanical gadgets. Onthenight ofthechallenge, justasKleppinihadplanned, Houdini offered him achoice ofcuffs and heselected the ones with thecombination lock. He was even able todisappearwith them behind ascreen tomake a quick test, andreemerged seconds later, confident ofvictory. Actingasifhesensed fraud, Houdini refused tolockKleppiniinthe cuffs. The two men arguedandbegantofight,even wrestlingwith each otheronstage.After afew minutes ofthis, anapparently angry,frustrated Houdini gave upand locked Kleppiniinthecuffs. Forthenext few minutes Kleppinistrained togetfree. Somethingwas wrong——minutes earlier he hadopenedthe cuffs behind the screen; now the same code nolonger worked. Hesweated, rackinghisbrains. Hours went by,theaudience left, andfinallyanexhausted and humiliated Kleppini gave upand asked tobe released. The cuffs thatKleppinihimself hadopened behind the screen with the word “C—L—E-F—S” (French for“keys”)now clickedopen only with the word “F-R-A-U-D. ”Kleppininever figuredouthow Houdini had accom- plishedthisuncannyfeat. Interpretation Althoughwedonotknow forcertain how Houdini accomplished many of hismost ingenious escapes,onethingisclear: Itwas nottheoccult, orany kind ofmagic,thatgavehim hispowers,buthard work and endlessprac- tice,allofwhich hecarefully concealed from theworld. Houdini never left anythingtochance-—-dayandnighthestudied theworkings oflocks, re- searched centuries-old sleight—of-hand tricks, poredover books onmechan ics,whatever hecould use.Everymoment notspent researching hespent workinghisbody, keepinghimself exceptionally limher, andlearninghow tocontrol hismuscles and hisbreathing.

The organizers oftheLondon handcuffchallengehad searched Houdini’s body thoroughly beforehand, but no one could check theinside ofhisthroat, where hecould have concealed small tools tohelphimescape.Even so, Kleppiniwasfundamentally wrong:Itwas notHoudini’s tools buthisprac- tice,work, and research that made hisescapes possible. Kleppini,infact, wascompletelyoutwitted byHoudini, who setthe whole
