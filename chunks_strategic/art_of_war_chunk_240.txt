congeners, is one of Liu�s most famous and popular works; it is the source of the war tales translated in Part Two of this book. The following selections would seem to summarize both philosophical and strategic mainstays of his thinking on conflict management, showing his intimate connection with classic traditions. Forgetting about Warfare Sages are very careful not to forget about danger when secure, not to forget about chaos in times of order. Even when there is peace in the land, it will not do to abandon the military altogether. If you lack sufficient foresight, you will be defenseless. It is necessary to develop cultured qualities internally while organizing military preparedness externally. Be considerate and gentle toward foreigners, beware of the unexpected. Routine military exercises in each of the four seasons is the way to show that the nation is not oblivious to warfare. Not forgetting about warfare means teaching the people not to give up the practice of martial arts. The rule is �Even if the land is at peace, to forget about warfare leads to collapse.� Caution in War In warfare, you should remain cautious. Go into action only when you see that it will be advantageous; if you see no advantage, then stop. Be prudent and do not act too readily. Then you will not fall into deadly situations. The rule is �Be immovable as a mountain.� Relaxation In war, you should not relax when you have scored a victory. You should be even more strictly on guard against enemies, still diligent even while at ease. The rule is �Be prepared, and you will have no trouble.� Security When enemies come from far off at the peak of their energy, it is to their advantage to fight right away; so increase your defenses, preserve your security, and do not respond�wait for them to wind down. Even if they try something to agitate you and pick a fight, do not move. The rule is �Be still when in a secure place.� Change The essence of the principles of warriors is responding to changes; expertise is a matter of knowing the military. In any action it is imperative to assess the enemy first. If opponents show no change or movement, then wait for them. Take advantage of change to respond accordingly, and you will benefit. The rule is �The ability to gain victory by changing and adapting according to opponents is called genius.� Militarism Weapons are instruments of ill omen, war is immoral. Really they are only to be resorted to when there is no other choice. It is not right to pursue aggressive warfare because one�s country is large and prosperous, for this ultimately ends in defeat and destruction. Then it is too late to have regrets. Military action is like a fire�if not stopped it will burn itself out. Military expansion and adventurism soon lead to disaster. The rule is �Even if a country is large, if it is militaristic it will eventually perish.� Like the works
