"Doyouwish us," Isaid, "tosayofhim that, asadrone growing upinacell isadisease ofahive, such amangrowing upinahouse isa drone andadisease ofacity?" "Most certainly, Socrates," hesaid. "Hasn't thegodmade alldrones withwings stingless, Adeiman- tus,butonlysome drones with feetstingless while others have terrible stings? From thestingless onescome thosewhoendupasbeggars in d oldage,while from thosewhohave stings come allwho arecalled wrongdoers." "Very true," hesaid. "It's plain, therefore," Isaid, "that inacitywhere youseebeg- gars,somewhere intheneighborhood thieves, cutpurses, temple rob- bers,andcraftsmen ofallsuch evils arehidden." "It isplain," hesaid. "What then? Incities under oligarchies don't youseebeggars present?" "Just about everyone except .the rulers," hesaid. e "Aren't wetosuppose," Isaid, "that there are alsomany wrongdoers with stingsamong them,whom theruling offices diligently holddown byforce?" "Wemust certainly suppose so,"hesaid. "Shallweassert thatsuchmen arise there asaresult ofwant of education, badrearing, andabadarrangement oftheregime?"

"That's pretty nearly it,"hesaid. "Then let's take it," Isaid, "thatwehave developed theregime 553a called oligarchy, one that gets itsrulers onthebasis ofaproperty assessment, andnext let'sconsider howtheman similar toitcomes into being andwhat he's likeoncehehascome intobeing." "Most certainly," hesaid. "Isthistheprincipal way inwhich thetransformation from that timocratic man toanoligarchic onetakes place?" "How?" "When hisson isbomand atfirstemulates hisfather andfollows inhisfootsteps, andthen seeshimblunder against thecityasagainst a b reefandwaste hisproperty aswell ashimself. Hehadeither been a general orhadheldsome other great ruling office, andthen gotentan- gledwith thecourt—suffering atthehands ofsycophants—andunder- went death, exile, ordishonori^ and losthiswhole substance." "That's likely," hesaid. "And theson,myfriend, seeing andsuffering thisandhaving lost hissubstance, isfrightened, Isuppose, andthrusts love ofhonor and spiritedness headlong outofthethrone ofhissoul; and,humbled by c poverty, heturns greedily tomoney-making; and bitbybitsaving and working, hecollects money. Don't yousuppose thatsuch amannow putsthedesiring andmoney-loving partonthethrone, andmakes itthe great king within himself, girding itwith tiaras, collars, andPersian swords?"!^ "Ido,"hesaid.

"There is,"hesaid, "noother transformation soquick andsosure from ayoungmanwholoveshonor toonewholovesmoney."
