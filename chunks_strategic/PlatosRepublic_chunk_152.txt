each question misled a little by the argu? ment; and when the littles are collected at the end of he arguments, the slip turns out to be great and contrary to the first assertions. And just as those who aren't clever at playing draughts are finally checked by those who are and don't know where to move, so they too are finally checked by this other kind of draughts, played not with counters but speeches, and don't know what to say. However, the truth isn't in any way af? fected by this. In saying this, I look to the present case. Now someone might say that in speech he can't contradict you at each particular thing asked, but in deed he sees that of all those who start out on philosophy-not those who take it up for the sake of getting educated when they are young and then drop it, but those who linger in it for a longer time-most become quite queer, not to say completely vicious; while the ones who seem perfectly decent, do nevertheless suffer at least one consequence of the practice you are praising-they become useless to the cities." And when I heard this, I said: "Do you suppose that the men who say this are lying?" "I don't know," he said, "but I should gladly hear yotlr opinion." "You would hear that it looks to me as if they were speaking the truth." "Then, how," he said, "can it be good to say that the cities will have no rest from evils before the philosophers, whom we agree to be useless to the cities, rule in them?" "The question youï¿½ are asking," I said, "needs an answer given through an image."5 "And you, in particular," he said, "I suppose, aren't used to speaking through images." "All right," I said. "Are you making fun of me after having in? volved me in an argument so hard to prove? At all events, listen to the 486 e 487 a b C d 488 l 488 a b C d e 489 a b image so you may see still more how greedy I am for images. So hard is the condition suffered by the most decent men with respect to the cities that there is no single other condition like it, but I must make my image and apology on their behalf by bringing it together from many sources-as the painters paint goatstags and such things by making mixtures. Conceive something of this kind happening either on many ships or one. Though the shipowner surpasses everyone on board in height and strength, he is rather deaf and likewise somewhat shortsighted, and his knowledge of seamanship is pretty much on the same level. The sailors are quarreling with one another about the pilot? ing, each supposing he ought to pilot, a1though he has never learned the art and can't produce his teacher or prove there was a time when he was learning it. Besides this, they claim it
