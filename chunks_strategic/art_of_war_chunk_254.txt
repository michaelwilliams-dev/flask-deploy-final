Learning of this, the Qiang divided up to comb the surrounding countryside, looking for the Chinese messengers who had been sent to the Han court for help. Now that the Qiang militia was scattered, the Chinese governor proceeded by forced marches night and day, covering over thirty miles a day. He had each mess sergeant make two stoves at first, and then increase the number of stoves each day. The Qiang did not dare to attack. Someone said to the governor, �The famous martialist Sun Bin decreased his campfires, while you increased them. Also, you went more than three times the maximum daily march recommended in military classics. Why is this?� The governor said, �The enemy had many soldiers, I had few.

He has also heard of your illness, and is surely that more the lax in his precautions. If you attack now, when he isn�t expecting it, you can capture or restrain him. This would be a good strategy to present to the king.� The retired Wu general said, �The Shu general is a brave and mettlesome man. He is already hard to oppose on this account. Furthermore, he has taken control of strategic territory, where he has won great prestige. With his recent successes and his growing boldness, it is not easy to plot against him.� When the retired Wu general got to the capital city, the king of Wu asked him, �If you are ill, who can replace you?� The retired
