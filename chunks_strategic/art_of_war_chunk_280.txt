weak, so it is hard to hold them off. Avoid them for the time being, and you can prevail. The rule is �Avoid the keen energy, strike the slumping and receding� (Sun Tzu, The Art of War, �Armed Struggle�). In the year 189, one of the generals of the imperial armies of the Han dynasty was sent out to quell a group of dissidents who tried to secede from the empire. The secessionists had surrounded a walled city, and the general was appointed to put down their insurrection. An imperial minister noted for his violent and cruel personality urged the general to proceed quickly, but the general said, �Even supposing victory in every battle, it is still better to win without fighting. Therefore Master Sun says in The Art of War, �Skillful warriors first make themselves invincible, then watch for vulnerability in their opponents.� �Now the city that the rebels have surrounded may be small, but it is well fortified and not easily taken. The secessionists have been making a powerful attack, yet the city has not fallen; so they must be tired.

Thus can citadels be taken and armies be beaten. The rule is �A surrounded army must be given a way out� (Sun Tzu, The Art of War, �Armed Struggle�). In the last days of the Han dynasty, the warlord Cao Cao surrounded a certain city. Enraged when the city refused to capitulate, Cao Cao swore, �When the city falls, we will bury everyone in it alive!� The siege went on for days, but the defenders of the city still did not give up. Now Cao Cao�s brother said to him, �A surrounded city must be shown a way out, a way to survival. Now that you have announced your intention to bury everyone alive, this has caused all the people to defend it for their own sakes. What is more, the city walls are strong and their supplies are abundant. As we besiege the city, our soldiers are being wounded; and time is dragging on as they hold out. Now we have stationed our troops outside a well-fortified city and are attacking enemies who will fight to the death�this is not good strategy.� So Cao
