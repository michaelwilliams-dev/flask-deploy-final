contrive to snatch the victory. But we must avoid borrowing foreign soldiers to help us." He then quotes from Wei Liao Tzu, ch. 3: "The nominal strength of mercenary troops may be 100,000, but their real value will be not more than half that figure."] 1. He who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is sure to be captured by them. [Ch�en Hao, quoting from the TSO CHUAN, says: "If bees and scorpions carry poison, how much more will a hostile state! Even a puny opponent, then, should not be treated with contempt."] 1. If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you, they will not prove submissive; and, unless submissive, then will be practically use- less. If, when the soldiers have become attached to you, punishments are not enforced, they will still be unless. 2. Therefore soldiers must be treated in the first instance with humanity, but kept under control by means of iron discipline. [Yen Tzu [B.C. 493] said of Ssu-ma Jang-chu: "His civil virtues endeared him to the people; his martial prowess kept his enemies in awe." Cf. Wu Tzu, ch. 4 init.: "The ideal commander unites culture with a warlike tem- per; the profession of arms requires a combination of hardness and tender- ness."] This is a certain road to victory. 1. If in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced, the army will be well-disciplined; if not, its discipline will be bad. 2. If a general shows confidence in his men but always insists on his orders being obeyed, CHAPTER 10. THE ARMY ON THE MARCH 85 [Tu Mu says: "A general ought in time of peace to show kindly confidence in his men and also make his authority respected, so that when they come to face the enemy, orders may be executed and discipline maintained, be- cause they all trust and look up to him." What Sun Tzu has said in ss. 44, however, would lead one rather to expect something like this: "If a general is always confident that his orders will be carried out," etc."] the gain will be mutual. [Chang Yu says: "The general has confidence in the men under his com- mand, and the men are docile, having confidence in him. Thus the gain is mutual" He quotes a pregnant sentence from Wei Liao Tzu, ch. 4: "The art of giving orders is not to try to rectify minor blunders and not to be swayed by petty doubts." Vacillation and fussiness are the surest means of sapping the confidence of an army.] Chapter 11 TERRAIN [Only about a third of the chapter, comprising ss. ss. 1-13, deals with "terrain," the subject being more fully treated in ch. XI. The "six calamities" are discussed in SS. 14-20, and the rest of the chapter is again a mere string of desultory remarks, though not less interesting, perhaps, on that account.] 1. Sun Tzu said: We may distinguish six kinds of terrain, to wit: 1. Accessible ground; [Mei Yao-ch�en
