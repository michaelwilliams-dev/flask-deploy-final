Even if we besiege it with all of our might it may not be possible for us to get our way. Let us attack another area, where there are few warriors and gentle terrain, a place that will be easy to take over.� The Martial Emperor refused to listen to this advice, and ultimately failed to succeed in his undertaking. Battle in Extremity Liu Ji said: In war, if you greatly outnumber your enemies, they will fear your military strength and flee without putting up a fight. In such an event, do not chase them, for people will fight back in extremity. You should follow them slowly with an orderly army; then you will win. The rule is �Do not press a desperate enemy� (Sun Tzu, The Art of War, �Armed Struggle�). In the first century B.C.E., during the Han dynasty, a Chinese imperial general moved against one of the tribes of the Qiang, an ancient relative of the modern Tibetan people. The Han general led his army up to the campgrounds of the Qiang, where they had been stationed for quite some time. The tribal warriors, in fact, had been garrisoned there for so long that they had grown slack. Thus when they saw the huge Chinese army in the distance, they abandoned their equipment and ran away, intending to cross the river that formed a natural boundary to the area. The road was narrow and cramped, and the Chinese general pursued the fleeing Qiang at a leisurely pace. Someone said to him, �We are going too slowly to follow up on our advantage.� But the general replied, �This is a case where �a desperate enemy is not to be pressed.� If we go easy, they will run without looking back; but if we rush them, they will turn around and fight to the death.� All of the officers of the imperial Chinese army agreed with the general. When the Qiang tribesmen plunged into the river, hundreds of them drowned and the rest ran away.

You will always win when you mobilize military forces against enemies under the following conditions: their leadership is benighted and their government policies are arbitrary; their armed forces are overbearing and their people are worn out; they drive out good and wise people; they judicially murder the innocent. Enemies like this can be beaten. The rule is �You successfully carry out a punitive strike when you follow natural timing� (Sun Tzu, The Art of War, �Strategic Assessments,� commentaries; also in �Sima�s Art of War,� �Determining Ranks�). The sixth-century Northern Qi dynasty was one of the short-lived reigns of the turbulent era of the Northern and Southern dynasties. It was founded by the younger brother of the assassinated king of Qi, a second-generation vassal of the Wei
