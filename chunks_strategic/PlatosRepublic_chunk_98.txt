are very many. If you ap? proach them as though they were one, you'll be a complete failure; but if you approach them as though they were many, offering to the ones the money and the powers or the very persons of the others, you'll al? ways have the use of many allies and few enemies. And as long as your city is moderately governed in the way it was just arranged, it will be biggest; I do not mean in the sense of good reputation but truly biggest, even if it should be made up of only one thousand defenders. You'll not easily find one city so big as this, either among the Greeks or the bar? barians, although many seem to be many times its size. Or do you sup? pose otherwise?" "No, by Zeus," he said. "Therefore," I said, "this would also be the fairest boundary for our rulers; so big must they make the city, and, bounding off enough land so that it will be of that size, they must let the rest go." "What boundary?" he said. "I suppose this one," I said, "up to that point in its growth at which it's willing to be one, let it grow, and not beyond." "That's fine," he said. "Therefore, we1l also set this further command on the guardians, to guard in every way against the city's being little or seemingly big; rather it should be sufficient and one." "This is," he said, "perhaps a slight task we will impose on them." "And still slighter than that," I said, "is what we mentioned earlier when we said that if a child of slight ability were born of the guardians, he would have to be sent off to the others, and if a serious one were born of the others, he would have to be sent off to the guardians. This was intended to make plain that each of the other ._ citizens too must be brought to that which naturally suits him-one � man, one job-so that each man, practicing his own, which is one, will not become many but one; and thus, you see, the whole city will naturally grow to be one and not many." "This is indeed," he said, "a lesser task than the other." "Yet, my good Adeimantus," I said, "these are not, as one might think, many great commands we are imposing on them, but they are all slight if, as the s�aying goes, they guard the one great-or, rather than great, sufficient-thing." "What's that?" he said. "Their education and rearing," I said. "If by being well educated they become sensible men, they'll easily see to all this and everything else we are now leaving out-that the possession of women, marriage, and procreation of children must as far as possible be arranged ac? cording to the proverb that friends have all things in common." "Yes," he said, "that would be the most correct way." "An<l hence," I said, "the regime, once well
