Is it imitation of looks or of truth?" "Of looks," he said. "Therefore, imitation is surely far from .the truth; and, as it seems, it is due to this that it produces everything-because it lays hold of a certain small part of each thing, and that part is itself only a phantom. For example, the painter, we say, will paint for us a shoe? maker, a carpenter, and the other craftsmen, although he doesn't understand the arts of any one of them. But, nevertheless, if he is a good painter, by painting a oarpenter and displaying him from far off, he would deceive children and foolish human beings into think? ing that it is truly a carpenter." "Of course." "But, in any event, I suppose, my friend, that this is what must be understood about all such things: when anyone reports to us about someone, saying that he has encountered a human being who knows all the crafts and everything else that single men several? ly know, and there is nothing that he does not know more precisely than anyone else, it would have to be replied to such a one that he is an innocent human being and that, as it seems, he has encountered some wizard and imitator and been deceived. Because he himself is unable to put knowledge and lack of knowledge and imitation to the test, that man seemed all-wise to him." "Very true," he said. "Then, next," I said, "tragedy and its leader, Homer, must be considered, since we hear from some that these men know all arts and all things human that have to do with virtue and vice, and the divine things too. For it is necessary that the good poet, if he is go? ing to make fair poems about the things his poetry concerns, be in possession of knowledge when he makes his poems or not be able to make them. Hence, we must consider whether those who tell us this have encountered these imitators and been deceived; and whether, therefore, seeing their works, they do not recognize that these works are third from what is and are easy to make for the man who doesn't know the truth-for such a man makes what look like beings but are not. Or, ag?.in, is there also something to what they 598a b C d e 599 a ï¿½ 599a b C d e 600a say, and do the good poets really know about the things that, in the opinion of the many, they say well?" "Most certainly," he said, "that must be tested." "Do you suppose that if a man were able to make both, the thing to be imitated and the phantom, he would permit himself to be serious about the crafting of the phantoms and set this at the head of his own life as the best thing he has?" "No, I don't." "But, I suppose, if he were in truth a knower of these things that he also imitates,
