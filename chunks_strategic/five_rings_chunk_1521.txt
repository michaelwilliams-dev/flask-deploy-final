Theproblemwas that hehad nomoney.The museum’s asking price was$15,000, butBarnum was able toputtogetheraproposalthatappealed totheinstitution’s owners even thoughitreplacedcashupfront with dozens ofguarantees and references. The owners came toaverbal agree ment with Barnum, but atthe lastminute, theprincipal partner changed hismind, and the museum and itscollection were sold tothedirectors of Peale’s Museum. Barnum wasinfuriated, but thepartner explainedthat business was business——the museum had been sold toPea1e’s because Peale’s had areputationand Barnum had none. Barnum immediatelydecided thatifhehad noreputationtobank on, hisonlyrecourse was tomin thereputation ofPeale’s. Accordinglyhe launched aletter-writing campaigninthenewspapers, callingthe owners a bunch of“broken-down bank directors” who had noidea how torun amu- seum orentertain people.Hewarned thepublic against buying Peale’s stock, since thebusiness’s purchase ofanother museum would invariably spreadits resources thin. The campaignwas effective, the stock plum- meted, and with no more confidence inPea.le’s track record and reputa- tion, the owners oftheAmerican Museum renegedontheir deal and sold thewhole thingtoBarnum. Ittookyears forPea.le’s torecover, andtheynever forgotwhat Bar- num had done. Mr. Peale himself decided toattack Barnum bybuildinga reputationfor“highbrow entertainment,” promotinghismuseum’s pro gramsasmore scientific than those ofhisvulgar competitor.Mesmerism (hypnotism)was one ofPea.le’s “scientific” attractions, and for awhile it drew bigcrowds and wasquitesuccessful. Tofight back, Barnum decided toattack Peale’s reputation yetagain. Barnum organizedarival mesmeric performanceinwhich hehimself apparently putalittle girl into atrance. Once she seemed tohave fallen deeply under, hetried tohypnotizemembers oftheaudience~—but nomat- terhow hard hetried, none ofthespectatorsfellunder hisspell,andmany ofthem begantolaugh.
