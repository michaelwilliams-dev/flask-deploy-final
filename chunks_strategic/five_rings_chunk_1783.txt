Ononehand, heshows ustheway outofthese anomalies; ontheother, heoffers explanations onhow andwhy we,insomany different ways, contribute tothatturmoil. Intheend, after allissaid anddone, Machiavelli carried on with atypical active optimism oftheRenaissance, wherein men keep busy indiscovering schemes andlaws inthebelief thatfel- lowhuman beings, aware oftheir inherent power, canconquer theworld from within andfrom without, andtogovern andbe governed fortheir benefit andforthebenefit oftheir later genera- tions. Asindividuals, however, wemake decisions based on choices andonpreferences available tous. And Machiavelli would observe that ashumans, wemake good choices when werealize thatitisbetter tobegoverned by virtuous individuals, who arealso astute, rather than byhungry tyrants, scheming forpower.

Inorder toappreciate thePrince atitstruevalue, therefore, themodern reader, imbued with theprinciples oftheCovenant of theLeague ofNations, must make allowance forthelesscivilized methods ofanearlier age; hemust, moreover, have some idea of thegeneral conditions prevailing inItaly atthetime when the book was written, andoftheparticular object thatMachiavelli hadinview inwriting it;otherwise theviolence ofmethod and immorality ofconduct recommended byMachiavelli may well appear inexplicable. Inthefifteenth century theancient authority oftheHoly Ro- man Empire hadalmost ceased toexist outside Germany, while theChurch, owing tothecorruption andterritorial ambitions of thePapal Court, hadalready lostmuch ofthatspiritual influence which hadbeen oneofthemain factors inkeeping allChristen- dom united inthepast. Europe hadbecome divided upinto a number ofhostile countries, each with itsown national language andcustoms, andFrance, Spain, andtheGerman states were be- ingrapidly consolidated into extensive kingdoms with strong central governments, andwith regular armies ledbythenobility 14— Niccolò Machiavelli who stillspent their lives intheprofession ofarms. Italy, however, amore cultivated andless warlike country than hernorthern neighbors, andlessdominated bythefeudal system, haddeveloped ondifferent lines. Inthatcountry, more especially inthenorth, theoldCommunes oftheMiddle Ages hadproved themost powerful element andhadgradually become transformed intonumberless small republics inwhich themem- bers oftheoldnobility found themselves reduced tothestate of mere citizens. Intheabsence ofanysuzerain tocheck their ambi- tions, themore advanced ofthese republics soon began toag- grandize themselves attheexpense oftheir weaker neighbors, andthence hadensued conditions ofrivalry, dissension, andcon- stant petty warfare thatwere thesource ofallItaly’s subsequent misfortunes. Two main causes contributed tokeep Italy inastate ofdis- content andconfusion, andtoprevent anypeaceful settlement of thecountry. Firstly, thecitizenship intherepublics ofthose days wasstrictly limited toasmall proportion oftheinhabitants ofthe central town ofeach republic; sothatwhen asmall republic was overcome andswallowed upbyamore powerful one, itscitizens lostalltheir civic rights; theresult ofthiswas thatthesmaller towns were continually revolting inthehope ofregaining their former freedom, oropening their gates toenemies oftherepublic onthechance ofbettering their position. Secondly, asthewealth- ierclasses who lived inthetowns hadreached ahigher state of culture than thecorresponding classes inother countries, and consequently were inclined tobecontemptuous oftheartsofwar, andasthegreater part ofthepopulation hadmore aptitude for commerce than forcampaigning, therepublics ofItaly hadbe- come incapable offighting their own battles, and they were driven toadopt thefatal course ofdepending onmercenary troops tofight their battles forthem.
