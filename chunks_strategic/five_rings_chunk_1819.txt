ofhalfourworld, butshealsoleaves halfa world toourgovernance. Icompare fortune tooneofthose floods thatfilltheplains, uproot trees, ruin buildings, andslide mud from onecorner totheother. Everyone runs before herandcan- notblock her. But, although thisisso,men inquiet times can prepare, repair, andbuild dams, sothatfortune, when itcomes, maychannel here orthere anditseffects need notbesodevastat- ingorwidespread. Fortune strikes inasimilar way. Shewrecks havoc where vir- tueisweak toresist herandshestrikes where sheknows nodams andbanks willcontain her.Ifyoulook atItaly, theplace ofall these convulsions, andtheconditions thatareopen tofortune, youwill seeItaly isacountry without banks andresources to fend offfate. Ifhere there were valor andvirtue asinGerman, Spain, andFrance, fortune would nothave played fastandloose asshehas. This isenough saidastoresisting fortune andfateingeneral. Astotheparticulars, IseePrinces risetoday andfalltomor 128—Niccolò Machiavelli rowwithout anychange intheir nature orcapability whatsoever. This happens firstforthemany reason Ihave already described, andnamely thatthePrince who relies onfortune gets ruined as soon asfortune changes. Ialso believe thataPrince succeeds who adapts tohistime, while thatPrince falls who isatvariance with theways ofhistime. Men advance totheir goals indifferent ways, whatever they aimat—glory andriches. One respects fate, theother rebels against it.One proceeds violently; another with art.One ispa- tient; another isnot.Each ofthese ways may succeed. One sees men with similar methods come todifferent ends, andalso men come tothesame endwith different methods —oneproceeding with caution, theother intrepid. This happens fornoother reason than theturn ofthetimes. Sometimes they aresuited toone method, sometimes toanother. Thus asIsaidithappens thattwo persons operating with thesame methods inonecase reach the objective andintheother case not. Thus, thegood varies according tocircumstances, whether oneshould govern with caution andpatience tosuitthetimes and itwill begood andsuccessful. Butiftimes andcircumstances change itispossible togetruined bynotchanging method. One never finds such aprudent man ascanaccommodate tothis, ei- therbecause hecannot change hisown nature orbecause, having been successful oneway, hecan’t part from thegiven path. A cautious man, when thetime comes tobebold, can’t doit.He getsruined. Ifonecould change with thenature ofthetimes and with circumstances, fortune would notchange. Pope Julius IIoperated impetuously inallhisaffairs. This suited times andcircumstances andhewassuccessful. Consider hisfirst moves inBologna when Giovanni Bentivogli was still alive. The Venetians looked askance atthis, theKing ofSpain also. France objected. ButJulius IIpersonally moved sofero- ciously andrapidly thathestood theSpanish andVenetians on their ears—theVenetians were afraid, while theSpanish hoped torecover thewhole Kingdom ofNaples. Louis theXIIofFrance fellinto place because seeing Spain move hehoped tostay THE PRINCE —-129 friends inorder toput down the Venetians ,and thought that tore- fuse military aid would beanoffence . So,Julius IIbrought off with his impetuousness what noother Pope could have done through prudence .Ifhehad only thought toleave Rome when things were inhand and everything set,as any other Pontiff would have done ,he would never have suc- ceeded .France would have made military excuses and the others athousand fears .Iwon't mention his other ventures ,allofwhich were similar ,all successful .Inthe shortness ofhis life ,itnever turned out otherwise .Iftimes had come for caution ,he would have been ruined .He never could have acted otherwise because hewas soinclined bynature . So,my conclusion isthat fortune changes and men when they stick by their methods are successful aslong asthey agree with fortune ,but when things change ,they gowrong .On the whole ,it isbetter to be impetuous than cautious because fortune isa woman .Itisnecessary
