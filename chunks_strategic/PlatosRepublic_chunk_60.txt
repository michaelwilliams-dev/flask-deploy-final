nature." "It doesn't seem so." "In your opinion, then, does the man who will be a fit guardian need, in addition to spiritedness, also to be a philosopher in his nature?''34 "How's that?" he said. "I don't understand." "This, too, you'll observe in dogs," I said, "and it's a thing in the beast worthy of our wonder." "What?" "When it sees someone it doesn't know, it's angry, although it never had any bad experience with him. And when it sees someone it knows, it greets him warmly, even if it never had a good experience with him. Didn't you ever wonder about this before?" "No, I haven't paid very�much attention to it up to now. But it's plain that it really does this." "Well, this does look like an attractive affection of its nature and truly philosophic." "In what way?" "In that it distinguishes friendly from hostile looks by nothing other than by having learned the one and being ignorant of the other," I said. "And so, how can it be anything other than a lover of learning since it defines what's its own and what's alien by knowledge and ignorance?" "It surely couldn't be anything but," he said. "Well," I said, "but aren't love of learning and love of wisdom the same?'' "Yes, the same," he said. "So shall we be bold and assert that a human being too, if he is going to be gentle to his own and those known to him, must by nature be a philosopher and a lover of learning?"

"Then he would be of this sort to begin with. But how; exactly, will they be reared and educated by us? And does our considering this contribute anything to our goal of discerning that for the sake of which we are considering all these things-in what way justice and injustice come into being in a city? We don't want to scant the argument, but we don't want an overlong one either." And Glaucon's brother said, "I most certainly expect that this present consideration will contribute to that goal." "By Zeus," I said, "then, my dear Adeimantus, it mustn't be given up even if it turns out to be quite long." "No, it mustn't." "Come, then, like men telling tales in a tale and at their leisure, let's educate the men in speech." "We must." "What is the education? Isn't it difficult to find a better one than that discovered over a great expanse of time? It is, of course, gymnastic for bodies and music36 for the soul." "Yes, it is." "Won't we begin educating in music before gymnastic?" "Of course." "You include speeches in music, don't you?" I said. "I do." "Do speeches have
