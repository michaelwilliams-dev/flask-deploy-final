Principality cannot see an evil aborning is not truly wise � and this is given to few. If you look at the first cause of the fall of the Roman Empire, you will see that they be.gan to conscript the Goths. From that move first came the weak.ening of Roman imperial forces. The valor they had passed to the Goths. I conclude that without its very own native troops no Princi.on pality is secure; in fact, fate hangs fortune, no longer having the virtuous valor that in adversity defends it in full faith. It was always the view of wise men �quod nihil sit tam informum aut instabile quam tam potential non sus vi nixa� (Tacitus: �No hu.man things is so weak and unstable as a reputation of strength not based on actual force�). One's own arms can be based on sub- or jects, citizens, or relatives: all other forces are mercenary auxiliary. The method of utilizing one's own troops will be easy to the see if you follow the example of four figures mentioned above (Cesare Borgia, Gerone II, David, Charles VII) and if you observe how Philip, father of Alexander the Great, and other Re.publicans and Princes have armed and defended themselves � on which rules I completely rely. WHAT ONE NEEDS TO KNOW IN A PRINCIPALITY ABOUT THE MILITIA nor tonoany thePrinceought and disciplinesotherothe objectiveThisothernoronlywarother ordersshould have war. is the anyart A attends f skills than and that concerns one in command. This is the virtue that maintains those born to rule but also makes the fortunes of those private leaders who rise to rank. Vice-versa, those Princes who think more of gentle arts instead of arms lose their states. The prime reason why Princes lose their states is the neglect of the art of war. The prime reason how persons acquire states is the profession of this art. Francesco Sforza, because he was armed, rose from private citizen be the Duke of Milan. His sons, discarding the hard- to ships and being unarmed brought scorn upon themselves. A Prince cannot afford to be scorned. There is no match between an armed and a disarmed force. It isn't reasonable for an armed party to voluntarily obey a disarmed party, or that a disarmed party rest secure among armed forces. He is at once scorned and suspect; so things cannot go well. His soldiers cannot esteem a Prince who does not understand militias, besides other problems, nor can he trust them. He must therefore never lose sight war exercises, and in of peace he has to stay armed more than in war. He can do this in two, two ways: one, operationally; mentally. Operationally, be.sides constantly maintaining and disciplining the troops, a Prince to must always hunt. This hardens the body hardship but also helps the Prince learn the nature of the landscape and places, the ways of mountains, valleys, plains, and he gets to understand the rivers and swamps and to respect them. This knowledge is useful
