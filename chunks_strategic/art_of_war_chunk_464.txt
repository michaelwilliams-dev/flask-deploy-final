authority is weak. If the banners and flags are shifted about, sedition is afoot. If the officers are angry, it means that the men are weary. [Tu Mu understands the sentence differently: "If all the officers of an army are angry with their general, it means that they are broken with fatigue" owing to the exertions which he has demanded from them.] 34. When an army feeds its horses with grain and kills its cattle for food, [In the ordinary course of things, the men would be fed on grain and the horses chiefly on grass.] and when the men do not hang their cooking-pots over the camp- fires, showing that they will not return to their tents, you may know that they are determined to fight to the death. [I may quote here the illustrative passage from the HOU HAN SHU, ch. 71, given in abbreviated form by the P�EI WEN YUN FU: "The rebel Wang Kuo of Liang was besieging the town of Ch�en- ts�ang, and Huang- fu Sung, who was in supreme command, and Tung Cho were sent out CHAPTER 10. THE ARMY ON THE MARCH 83 against him. The latter pressed for hasty measures, but Sung turned a deaf ear to his counsel. At last the rebels were utterly worn out, and began to throw down their weapons of their own accord. Sung was not advancing to the attack, but Cho said: �It is a principle of war not to pursue desperate men and not to press a retreating host.� Sung answered: �That does not apply here. What I am about to attack is a jaded army, not a retreating host; with disciplined troops I am falling on a disorganized multitude, not a band of desperate men.� Thereupon he advances to the attack unsupported by his colleague, and routed the enemy, Wang Kuo being slain."] 35. The sight of men whispering together in small knots or speaking in sub- dued tones points to disaffection amongst the rank and file. 36. Too frequent rewards signify that the enemy is at the end of his resources; [Because, when an army is hard pressed, as Tu Mu says, there is always a fear of mutiny, and lavish rewards are given to keep the men in good temper.] too many punishments betray a condition of dire distress. [Because in such case discipline becomes relaxed, and unwonted severity is necessary to keep the men to their duty.] 37. To begin by bluster, but afterwards to take fright at the enemy�s numbers, shows a supreme lack of intelligence. [I follow the interpretation of Ts�ao Kung, also adopted by Li Ch�uan, Tu Mu, and Chang Yu. Another possible meaning set forth by Tu Yu, Chia Lin, Mei Tao-ch�en and Wang Hsi, is: "The general who is first tyran- nical towards his men, and then in terror lest they should mutiny, etc." This would connect the sentence with what went before about rewards and punishments.] 38. When envoys are sent with compliments in their
