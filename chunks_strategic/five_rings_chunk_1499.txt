He also loved money, forheled anextravagant lifestyle. Fouquetwas clever andverymuch indispensabletotheking,sowhen theprimemim's— ter,Jules Mazarin, died, in1661, the finance minister expectedtobe named the successor. Instead, thekingdecided toabolish theposition. This and other signs made Fouquet suspectthat hewasfallingoutoffavor, and sohedecided toingraliate himself with theking bystaging the mostspec- tacularpartytheworld had ever seen. The party’sostensiblepurpose would betocommemorate thecompletion ofFouquet’s chateau, Vaux—le- Vicomte, but itsreal function was topay tribute totheking, theguest of honor. The most brilliant nobility ofEuropeand some ofthegreatest minds ofthe Iime—La Fontaine, LaRochefoucauld, Madame deSévigné— attended theparty.Moliere wrote aplayfortheoccasion, inwhich he himself was toperformattheevening’s conclusion. Theparty began with a lavish seven—course dinner, featuringfoods from the Orient never be- fore tasted inFrance,aswell asnew dishes created especially forthenight. The meal was accompanied with music commissioned byFouquetto honor theking. After dinner there was apromenade throughthechateau’s gardens. Thegrounds and fountains ofVaux—le»Vicomte were tobetheinspiration forVersailles. Fouquet personally accompaniedtheyoung king throughthegeomet- rically aligned arrangements ofshrubberyand flower beds. Arrivingatthe gardens’ canals, theywitnessed afireworks display,which was followed by theperformance ofMoliere’s play. The partyranwell into thenightand everyone agreed itwas themost amazing affair they had ever attended. The next day, Fouquetwas arrested bytheking’shead musketeer, D’Artagna.n. Three months later hewent ontrial forstealing from the country’s treasury. (Actually,most ofthestealing hewas accused ofhehad done onthekings behalf and with theking’s permission.) Fouquetwas found guiltyand sent tothe most isolated prisoninFrance, highinthe Pyrenees Mountains, where hespentthelasttwenty yearsofhislifeinsoli- taryconfinement. Interpretation Louis XIV, theSunKing,was aproud andarrogantman who wanted tobe the center ofattention atalltimes; hecould not countenance beingout- done inlavishness byanyone,andcertainlynot hisfinance minister. To succeed Fouquet,Louis chose _]ean—Baptiste Colbert, aman famous forhis parsimonyand forgivingthedullest partiesinParis. Colbert made sure thatany moneyliberated from thetreasurywent straightinto Louis’s hands. With themoney, Louis built apalaceeven more magnificent than Fouquet’s—the glorious palaceofVersailles. Heused the same architects, decorators, andgarden designer.And atVersailles, Louis hosted parties even more extravagant than the onethat costFouquethisfreedom.
