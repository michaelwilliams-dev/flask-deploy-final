most rigorously enforced? [Tu Mu alludes to the remarkable story of Ts�ao Ts�ao (A.D. 155-220), who was such a strict disciplinarian that once, in accordance with his own severe regulations against injury to standing crops, he condemned himself to death for having allowed him horse to shy into a field of corn! However, in lieu of losing his head, he was persuaded to satisfy his sense of justice by cutting off his hair. Ts�ao Ts�ao�s own comment on the present passage is characteristically curt: "when you lay down a law, see that it is not disobeyed; if it is disobeyed the offender must be put to death."] 2. Which army is stronger? CHAPTER 2. LAYING PLANS 31 [Morally as well as physically. As Mei Yao-ch�en puts it, freely rendered, "ESPIRIT DE CORPS and �big battalions.�"] 2. On which side are officers and men more highly trained? [Tu Yu quotes Wang Tzu as saying: "Without constant practice, the officers will be nervous and undecided when mustering for battle; without constant practice, the general will be wavering and irresolute when the crisis is at hand."] 2. In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and pun- ishment?

By means of these seven considerations I can forecast victory or defeat. 8. The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon it, will con- quer: �let such a one be retained in command!

[The form of this paragraph reminds us that Sun Tzu�s treatise was com- posed expressly for the benefit of his patron Ho Lu, king of the Wu State.] 7. While heading the profit of my counsel, avail yourself also of any helpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules. 8. According as circumstances are favorable, one should modify one�s plans. [Sun Tzu, as a practical soldier, will have none of the "bookish theoric." He cautions us here not to pin our faith to abstract principles; "for," as Chang Yu puts it, "while the main laws of strategy can be stated clearly enough for the benefit of all and sundry, you must be guided by the ac- tions of the enemy in attempting to secure a favorable position in actual warfare." On the eve of the battle of Waterloo, Lord Uxbridge, command- ing the cavalry, went to the Duke of Wellington in order to learn what his plans and calculations were for the morrow, because, as he explained, he might suddenly find himself Commander-in-chief and would be unable to frame new plans in a critical moment. The Duke listened quietly and then said: "Who will attack the first tomorrow � I or Bonaparte?" "Bonaparte," replied Lord Uxbridge. "Well," continued the Duke, "Bonaparte has not given me any idea of his projects; and as my plans will
