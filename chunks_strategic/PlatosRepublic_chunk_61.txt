a double form, the one true, the other false?" "Yes." 377 a "Must they be educated in both, but first in the false?" "I don't understand how you mean that," he said. "Don't you understand," I said, "that first we tell tales to chil? dren? And surely they are, as a whole, false, though there are true things in them too. We make use of tales with children before exer? cises." "That's so." "That's what I meant by saying music must be taken up before gymnastic." ï¿½ "That's right," he said. "Don't you know that the beginning is the most important part of b every work and that this is especially so with anything young and ten? der? For at that stage it's most plastic, and each thing assimilates itself to the model whose stamp anyone wishes to give to it." "Quite so." "Then shall we so easily let the children hear just any tales fashioned by just anyone and take into their souls opinions for the most part opposite to those we'll suppose they must have when they are grown up?" "In no event will we permit it." "First, as it seems, we must supervise the makers of tales; and if they make37 a fine tale, it must be approved, but if it's not, it must be rejected. We11 persuade nurses and mothers to tell the approved tales to their children and to shape their souls with tales more than their bodies with hands. Most of those they now tell must be thrown out." "Which sort?" he said. "In the greater tales we'll also see the smaller ones," I said. "For both the greater and the smaller must be taken from the same model and have the same power. Don't you suppose so?" "I do," he said. "But I don't grasp what you mean by the greater ones.,, "The ones Hesiod and Homer told us, and the other poets too. They surely composed false tales for human beings and used to tell them and still do tell them." "But what sort," he said, "and what do you mean to blame in them?" "What ought to be blamed first and foremost," I said, "especially if the lie a man tells isn't a fine one." "What's that?" "When a man in speech makes a bad representation of what gods and heroes are like, just as a painter_ who paints something that doesn't resemble the things whose likeness he wished to paint." "Yes, it's right to blame such things," he said. "But how do we mean this and what sort of thing is it?" "First," I said, "the man who told the biggest lie about the biggest things didn't tell a fine lie-how Uranus did what Hesiod says he did, and how Cronos in his turn took revenge on him.38 And Cronos' deeds and his sufferings at the hands of his son,39 not even if they were true would I suppose they should so easily be told to thoughtless young things; best
