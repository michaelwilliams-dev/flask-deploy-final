activity forhim.Love oflearning is another expression ofman's eros, ofhislonging forcompleteness. Such [392 ] Interpretive Essay amanwants toknow everything, aware thatnopartcanbeunderstood without being considered inrelation tothewhole. Socrates simply describes thatrarebutrevealing phenomenon, thetheoretical man,he whoproves thepossibility ofdisinterested knowledge. He istheman whocanpreserve hisdisinterestedness even inthe difficult human questions which concern himmost immediately, because heismore at- tracted byclarity than life, satisfaction ofdesire, orhonor. The philosopher introduces tothecityadimension ofreason thathadnot been discerned intheearlier discussion ofit. Glaucon objects thatonthebasis ofthis description ofthe philosopher, allthelovers ofsights andhearing— particularly the lovers ofthefestivals where thepoets display theirdramas— would have tobeconsidered philosophers. Inresponse tothisobjection, Soc- rates defines thesecond salient characteristic ofthephilosopher: heis alover oftheoneideaofeach thing andnotthemany things which participate intheideas, ofbeing andnotbecoming, ofknowledge and notopinion. Thus Socrates introduces theteaching forwhich heismost renowned andwhich constitutes themost difficult part ofhis thought— theideas. Here thisteaching ispresented toayoung man who isnotaphilosopher inacontext where itisnottheprimary con- cern.Hence thetreatment ofitismost inadequate, andtheexistence of theideas isassumed rather thanproved. Socrates only tries tosatisfy Glaucon thatthephilosopher hasconcern forareality other than that ofmostmen. Insodoing, Socrates appeals particularly toGlaucon's ownexperience with thebeautiful things heloves somuch. That ex- perience shows Glaucon that allthebeautiful things heknows arealso insomeways ugly,andthatwhatwasonce beautiful becomes ugly. These beautiful things seem tobeunderstood tobebeautiful inrelation tosome standard which isentirely beautiful, theapproach towhich makes them beautiful. That standard isbeautiful, while thethings which imitate itareandarenotbeautiful atthesame time. Things which come intobeing andpassaway areonly totheextent thatthey partake ofwhat doesnotcome intobeing orpassaway. Theideas are thepermanent onesbehind thechanging manys towhichweapply the same name. Thus they arethecauses ofthethings seenandheard— causes notinthesense thatthey explain thecoming-into-being ofa particular thing but inthesense thatthey explain itscharacter. The ideaofman isthecause ofaparticular man's being amanrather than a collection oftheelements towhich hecanbereduced. Theideas, then, arethejustification ofthephilosophic life. Ifthere arenopermanent entities, ifeverything isinflux,there canbenoknowledge. Knowledge, orscience, requires universals ofwhich theparticulars areimperfect [393 ] THEREPUBLIC examples; asknowing beings wecareonly fortheuniversals. Theideas give reality totheuniversals andhencemake itpossible toexplain the factthatman possesses knowledge. Theideas arethebeing ofthings. They constitute anaccount ofthe firstcauses ofthings which alsodoes justice totheobserved heterogeneity ofthevisible universe, unlike earlier, pre-Socratic accounts ofbeing which required thereduction of allthings toasingle kind ofbeing— liketheatoms— thusmaking the specific characters ofthose things unintelligible. Thisteaching provides those intelligible, diverse, permanent, universal beings which themind seems toseekwhen itattempts todefiine ortoexplain. Inundertaking tolook forjustice, Socrates andhiscompanions were looking forsome- thing real,which hasahigher dignity than,andcanactasastandard for,theimperfect justice v^hich theyfound inmenand cities. Ifthere is notsomething likeanideaofjustice, their quest isfutile. And itisinthisquest fortheuniversal principles that the theoretical man firstmeets theopposition oftheunphilosophic men whomakeupacity.They areloyal nottocities ingeneral buttotheir own city;theylovenotmen ingeneral, butthisparticular manorwom- an;they arenotinterested inthenature ofthespecies, buttheirown fates. However, allthethings towhich citizens aremost passionately attached have alessened reality intheeyesofthetheoretical man;what ispeculiar tothese things, what constitutes theircharm fortheprac- ticalman,mustbeovercome inorder tounderstand them. Forthe practical mantheparticular things towhich heisattached arethereal things, andhewill resist anyattempt togobeyond them to"themore general case," which would destroy their character andhiscapacity to possess them ashisveryown.The city inspeech ofthephilosopher comes intobeing onlybydepreciating Athens, andanyother city in whichmencan live.Tothephilosopher thecity inspeech ismore lovable andmore realthananyoftheparticular citieswhich aretohim poor imitations ofthecity inspeech.
