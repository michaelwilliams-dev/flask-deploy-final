of Yueh exceed our own in number, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory. I say then that victory can be achieved. [Alas for these brave words! The long feud between the two states ended in 473 B.C. with the total defeat of Wu by Kou Chien and its incorporation in Yueh. This was doubtless long after Sun Tzu�s death. With his present assertion compare IV. ss. 4. Chang Yu is the only one to point out the seeming discrepancy, which he thus goes on to explain: "In the chapter on Tactical Dispositions it is said, �One may KNOW how to conquer without being able to DO it,� whereas here we have the statement that �victory� can be achieved.� The explanation is, that in the former chapter, where the offensive and defensive are under discussion, it is said that if the en- emy is fully prepared, one cannot make certain of beating him. But the present passage refers particularly to the soldiers of Yueh who, according to Sun Tzu�s calculations, will be kept in ignorance of the time and place of the impending struggle. That is why he says here that victory can be achieved."] 22. Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we may prevent him from fight- ing. Scheme so as to discover his plans and the likelihood of their success. [An alternative reading offered by Chia Lin is: "Know beforehand all plans conducive to our success and to the enemy�s failure." 23. Rouse him, and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity. [Chang Yu tells us that by noting the joy or anger shown by the enemy on being thus disturbed, we shall be able to conclude whether his policy is to CHAPTER 7. WEAK POINTS AND STRONG 58 lie low or the reverse. He instances the action of Cho-ku Liang, who sent the scornful present of a woman�s head-dress to Ssu-ma I, in order to goad him out of his Fabian tactics.] Force him to reveal himself, so as to find out his vulnerable spots. 24. Carefully compare the opposing army with your own, so that you may know where strength is superabundant and where it is deficient. [Cf. IV. ss. 6.] 25. In making tactical dispositions, the highest pitch you can attain is to con- ceal them; [The piquancy of the paradox evaporates in translation. Concealment is perhaps not so much actual invisibility (see supra ss. 9) as "showing no sign" of what you mean to do, of the plans that are formed in your brain.] conceal your dispositions, and you will be safe from the prying of the subtlest spies, from the machinations of the wisest brains. [Tu Mu explains: "Though the enemy may have clever and capable of- ficers, they will not be able to lay any plans against us."] 26. How victory may be produced for them out of the enemy�s own tactics� that is what the multitude cannot comprehend. 27. All men can see the tactics whereby
