"And with respect toeverything else aswell, isjustice useless in theuseofeachanduseful initsuselessness?" "I'm afraid so." e "Then justice, myfriend, wouldn't beanything very serious, ifit isuseful foruseless things. Let's look atitthisway. Isn't themanwho iscleverest atlanding ablow inboxing, oranyother kind offight, also theonecleverest atguarding against it?" "Certainly." "And whoever isclever atguarding against disease isalso cleverest atgetting away withproducing it?" "Inmyopinion, atanyrate." "And, ofcourse, agood guardian ofanarmy istheverysameman 334a whocanalso steal theenemy's plans and hisother dispositions?" "Certainly." "Soofwhatever aman isaclever guardian, he isalso aclever thief?" "Itseems so." "Sothat ifaman isclever atguarding money, heisalsoclever at stealing it?" "Sotheargument's indicates atleast," hesaid. "The justman, then, asitseems, hascome tolight asakind of robber, andI'mafraid youlearned thisfromHomer. Forheadmires b Autolycus, Odysseus' grandfather'^ onhismother's side,andsayshe [10 ] Book 11333c-335a socrates/polemarchus surpassed allmen 'instealing and inswearing oaths.'

"Then, after all," Isaid, "it'sjust toharm theunjust andhelp the just?" "This looks finer thanwhatwejustsaid." "Then formany, Polemarchus —allhuman beings whomake mistakes—itwillturn outtobejust toharm friends, fortheir friends e arebad;andjust tohelpenemies, forthey aregood.
