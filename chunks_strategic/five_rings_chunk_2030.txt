inspeech ofwhich Socrates isamember; thus, inde- fending this city,Adeimantus isalsodefending Socrates. Hismoralism andmoral indignation arenow intheservice ofacitydevoted to philosophy, andheisitsprotector against what threatens it.Adeiman- tuswaspreviously anadmirer ofSparta andused itasastandard to criticize menand cities; Socrates induces him toabandon thatstandard infavor ofthecityoftheRepublic, byshowing himthatthenew city has allthevirtues ofSparta and isagreatimprovement on it.TheSpar- tanstandard caused Adeimantus tocondemn behavior which didnot conform toit,which means thathecondemned philosophy along with many vices.Now, with hisnew standard, hewill stillcondemn those vices, buthewillseeinthephilosopher ablessed remnant ofthebest regime rather than asignofthecorruption ofthetimes. Inorder tore- enforce Adeimantus' belief inthereality ofthisregime andhence inthe correctness ofusing itasastandard, Socrates constructs amythwhich assures himthatthegood citydidindeed exist alongtime ago.This regime isnotonly possible, but it(notSparta oranyoldregime of Athens) isthetruly ancestral regime, andtherefore deserves therespect ofmen likeAdeimantus whohave thetendency toregard theancestral asthegood. Moreover, Socrates tellsthetaleinsuch away thatAdei- [413 ] THEREPUBLIC mantus willnotcommit any follies inattempting toreinstitute the ancestral regime. Itisirrevocably inthepast,andanychanges inthe present regime canonly lead toaworse regime. Thus Socrates turns Adeimantus into aconservative and neutralizes hispotentially dangerous idealism. Adeimantus willnotlove thedemocracy under which helives, buthewillalsonotwant tosee itoverturned; hewill support what isbest inthatregime andrespect thephilosopher who lives inthecitygoverned by it.With thisaltered perspective, Adeiman- tusjoins Socrates injudging thevarious imperfect regimes andmen, andthereby they setthestage forGlaucon's judgment ofthetyrannic life. InBooks VIIIandIXSocrates sketches theoutlines ofapolitical science. This presentation schematizes fivefundamental kinds of regimes and fiveways oflifeortypes ofmenwho arerelated tothose regimes. Thus abasis isprovided forcategorizing political phenomena andunderstanding their causes; suchknowledge, inturn,provides guid- ance inpolitical deliberation andchoice. Theregime istreated asthe most important political factandthecause ofalltheother facts.The regime isidentical with theclass, orkind, ofmenwhohold theruling offices. Asthis class varies, sodoes theway oflifeofthecity.The regime determines thecharacter oflaw,education, property, marriage, andthefamily. Therefore, theregime iswhat must bestudied by anyone who isinterested intheeffect ofpolitics onhislifeorhispur- suitofthegood life.This isthemostimportant question, andarelevant political science isdesigned toanswer it.The different kinds ofregime aredistinguished bytheir explicit goals, which derive from theways of lifemencanchoose. Truly different regimes, andmen, stem from significant andirreducible differences ofprinciple. Socrates suggests thatwisdom, honor, money, freedom, andlove aretheendswhichmen pursue andforwhich theycanusethepolitical order; thedominance of oneprinciple oranother brings forth very different dimensions inthe lives ofmen.Thehealthy soul isthestandard forthejudgment of regimes andthekeytounderstanding them; thehealthy regime isthe onethatallows forthedevelopment ofhealthy souls. Such apolitical science ismore akin tomedicine than tomathematics. Political science mustbeevaluative; justasadoctor mustknow what ahealthy body is, apolitical scientist mustknowwhat ahealthy regime is.Such apolitical science provides amuch richer andmore comprehensive framework than thatprovided byourcontemporary political science with itsover- simplified dichotomies, democratic versus totalitarian ordeveloped versus underdeveloped. These represent apalereminiscence ofthe Socratic approach, impoverished bothbecause werelytoomuch onthe [414 ] Interpretive Essay narrow experience ofourowntimeandbecause ofourattempts to erect avalue-free science onthefoundation ofthatnarrow experience. Socrates' political science aspresented here isnotquite serious because itisabsurdly severe, using asitsstandard aregime which can never exist. Socrates still insists thattheregime ofphilosopher-kings canexistandthat allother regimes arecorruptions ofit.Hisprocedure isjustified byhisdesire toinclude allthehighest capacities inthecity, tomake thecomplete man apartofthecomplete city.Buttheinclu- sionofthephilosopher stretches thelimits ofthecitybeyond therealm ofthepossible. Aristotle elaborated Socrates' sketch andturned itinto atrue political science byadjusting hisstandard tothepossibilities of political life.Aristotle treats thegentlemen asthough their virtue were complete and self-sufficient, thusmaking itpossible tobasedecent regimes onthegentlemen. Inhisview, anyregime inwhich therulers care forthecommon good islegitimate,
