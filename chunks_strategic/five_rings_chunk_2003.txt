Such astudy isimpossible inthis citybecause itistoosimple. Glaucon recognizes thiswhen hewarns Socrates that itwillbedifficult tohavegoodjudges intheir citybecause themen initwillnothave sufficient experience with thediversity of souls tobeable todiagnose andtreatthem properly. Socrates chooses toignore thequestion, but itisclear thathehasmore tolearnfrom the [363 ] THEREPUBLIC experience ofHerodicus andHomer—from complex medicine and complex poetry which know notonly thegood butalsothebad— than heishere willing toadmit. Itseems thatthearts—andhence intellec- tualperfection— flourish inanatmosphere which isinimical tothe citizen virtue ofthewarriors. Asoldier oranartisan who forgets his bodyandconcentrates onhiswork issurely better athistrade, butthe body cannot beforgotten bythemanwhowishes tohaveknowledge of thebodyand itsrelation tothesoul.Thedemands ofcitizen virtue and intellectual virtue aredifferent. What appears tobeaconcentration on thewarriors' souls isactually aconcern forthepower oftheir bodies. If thewarriors were toseethetruth about bodies, theycould notbe trusted tocontrol them. Their education isincomplete andsoarethey. Socrates' denigration ofthebody goes sofarthatheendsbydeny- ingthatgymnastic hasanything todowith thebody atall.Itsrealpur- pose istotraift thesoul. Justasthespirited partofthesoulneeded soft- ening, sothegentle orphilosophic partneeds hardening. Reason tends tobeweak inthat itputs itself intotheservice ofthepassions orgives way totherageofspiritedness. Itmustbestrengthened sothat itcan resist particular desires andangers initsquest fortheuniversal truth. Gymnastic serves that function. Inthepreparation ofthewarriors' souls forgood citizenship, Socrates also looks totheir openness to philosophy andthesalvation ofanypotential philosophers arnong them. Spiritedness andgentleness arethewarp andwoof ofthesoul, eachnecessary toitshealthy functioning butinadelicate balance with oneanother.. Toalter themetaphor, thesoulmustbetuned likeanin- strument, byrelaxing andtightening thestrings; this iswhat education inmusic andgymnastic does.Theproper tuning oftheinstrument is theprecondition ofcitizenship andofphilosophy. Attheendofthewarriors' education— aneducation intended to make themgood guardians ofapeaceful people—itbecomes evident thatthevirtue which hasbeenencouraged ismoderation. Thiseduca- tion isnowcomplete andthewarriors areabout toassume their func- tions, butthere hasbeennotraining injustice. Itseems possible to havegood guardians who arenotjust.Thiscanbeexplained only if moderation isanequivalent ofjustice. Andmoderation is,atleastfrom the city's standpoint, suchanequivalent. Themain source ofcivic strife iscompetition forscarce good things, andthosewhocancontrol their desires forthese things areleast likely tofind ittotheiradvantage tobeseditious andbreak thelaws. Inthecityofsows, theharmony of public andprivate interest wasinsured bythesimplicity ofdesire, natural plenty, andthe skillofthe arts.Once desire hasbeeneman- [364 ] Interpretive Essay cipated, thevirtue ofmoderation— understood asthecontrol of spiritedness aswell asdesire— isused tore-establish thatharmony. {412h-il6d) Thenext step intheestablishment oftheregime is theselection ofrulers. These must betheolder warriors who also possess prudence andmilitary capacity andwho care forthecity. Al- though theother qualifications seem equally important, theonlyone discussed isthatofcaring forthecity.Thesevere education ofthewar- riors hasnotrendered them freeofthetemptations which might ul- timately make them wolves instead ofwatchdogs. They stillthink of thegood things asthosewhich arescarce andwhichmenwish tokeep privately forthemselves. Nothing intheireducation hasasyetattached them tothiscityand itswell-being. Iftheyaretocare forthecitythey must love it,and ifthey aretolove ittheymust connect itwith their own self-love: they willlove thecitymost ifthey areoftheopinion that the city's advantage istheirown advantage. Apparently, this opinion isconstantly threatened, either because itisnotsimply evident tonatural reason orbecause reason cansoeasily bemastered bysophistic arguments orbypassions. Thus themost important criterion intheselection oftherulers isthattheyhold thisopinion most solidly. Themost elaborate techniques areused totestthem. Andeven thisdoesnotsuffice toguarantee thatthey willlovethecity. Theymustbeshowered withhonors andrewards which willgivethem evenmore palpable proof ofhowadvantageous thecity isforthem. But alltheeducation, testing, andhonors arenotenough tore- establish theharmony between private andpublic interest which disappeared with thecityofsows.Theonlyremedy thatSocrates can find isagreat lie—thenoble lie.
