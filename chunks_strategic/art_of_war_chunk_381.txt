regions in the course of three journeys, during which he met adepts of various schools and transmitted and spread the art of his own school. Here is a passage from the Koyo gunkan recounting his first journey: �On the journey he took to improve his understanding of strategy, Tsukahara Bokuden traveled on horseback with three spare horses, taking along with him three hunting falcons. Eighty men made up his retinue. Thus, with regard to his study of strategy, lords as well as accomplished adepts treated him with respect. Bokuden was a real adept of the art of the sword.� (15, p. 10; 32, p. 24) In Kyoto Bokuden taught his art of swordsmanship to three Ashikaga shoguns in succession: Yoshiharu (1511�1550), Yoshiteru (1536?�1565), and Yoshiaki (1537�1597). Within the Katori and Kashima traditions, the lineage of Iizasa Choisai, Matsumoto Bizen, and Tsukahara Bokuden Takamoto is the best known. (1-b, 1- c, 15, 32, 42) The techniques of the schools of swordsmanship that issued from this tradition are forceful and simple, since they were intended to be used on the field of battle, where warriors fought in armor. In his text Musashi seems to be making an allusion to the manner in which Tsukahara Bokuden propagated his school. Musashi also wrote that Arima Kihei, his first opponent in a duel, was a practitioner of the Shinto ryu, founded by Tsukahara Bokuden. 15. �The ten talents and the seven arts,� ju no shichi gei: According to the dictionary (100), no and gei have the following meanings: No: (1) The ability to accomplish things; (2) a person who has a talent or who has accomplished things; (3) the technique of an art, ability for technique; (4) effectiveness; (5) Noh theater. Gei: (1) The technique or the knowledge acquired in a martial science or art; arts, crafts; (2) game technique; (3) technique, work. 16. �Pragmatic domain,� rikata: Literally, ri means (1) trenchant, very sharp; (2) convenient; (3) effective, useful; (4) the terrain is excellent; (5) victory; (6) interest, advantage, gain. Kata means �direction,� �position,� �domain,� �means.� Thus rikata refers to a domain that creates an interest or an advantage and therefore has a concrete usefulness. 17. �The principles,� ri: Musashi frequently uses the word ri in the sense of principle or reason (see �Ri� in the appendix). �The sword�: kenjutsu literally means �techniques of the sword,� hence �the sword,� �the art of the sword,� or �swordsmanship.� 18. During Musashi�s time, encounters between schools of the sword were for the most part battles fought without mercy, and taking matters lightly or having the illusion of knowledge could result in death. Thus he recommends not pausing over what is not essential. Musashi�s own difficulties show through behind this remark�he never obtained a position of responsibility from a great lord commensurate with the abilities he considered himself to possess. 19. �Four ways�: The description of the four ways�warrior, shi; peasant, no; artisan, ko; and merchant, sho�does not follow the hierarchical order. This might seem a bit incoherent, but
