Heperformedhismiracles inan enormous converted beer hall, outside which Berliners begantonotice ever longerlines ofpeople—-the blind, thelame, anyonewith anillness in curable bynormal medicine. When itleaked outthat thedoctor worked by exposingthepatienttotheraysofthemoon, hesoon became dubbed The Moon Doctor ofBerlin. Sometime in1783, itwasreportedthat Dr.Weisleder had cured awell» to—do woman ofaterrible ailment. Hesuddenlybecame acelebrity.Previ~ ously onlythepoorestBerliners had been seen waiting outside thebeer hallintheirrags;nowmagnificent carriageswere parked outside, and gen- tlemen infrock coats, and ladies with enormous coiffures, lined the street assunset drew near. Even folk with themildest ofailments came, outof sheer curiosity, Astheywaited inline, thepoorerclients would explainto thegentlemenand ladies that thedoctor only practicedwhen the moon was initsincrescent phase. Many would add that theythemselves had al ready been exposedtothehealing powershecalled forth from therays of the moon. Even those who feltcured kept coming back, drawn bythis powerful experience. Inside thebeer hall, astrange andstirring spectacle greeted thevisitor: Packed into the entrance hall was acrowd ofallclasses and ethnic bar.k~ grounds,averitable Tower ofBabel. Throughtallwindows onthenorthern side ofthehall,silvery moonlight pouredinatoddangles.The doctor and hiswife, who, itseemed, was also able toeffect thecure, practicedonthe second floor, which was reached byatstairway,attheendofthehall. Asthe lineedgedcloser tothestairs, thesick would hear shouts and cries from above, and word would spread of,perhaps,ablind gentleman suddenly able tosee. Once upstairs,theline would fork intwodirections, toward anorth- ern room forthedoctor, asouthern one forhiswife, who worked onlyon theladies. Finally,after hours ofanticipationandwaitinginline, thegen- tlemen patientswould beledbefore theamazing doctor himself, ancl‘ derlyman with afewstalks ofwildgrayhair and anairofnervousenergy. Hewould take thepatient (letussayayoung boy, broughtinbyhisfa- ther), uncover theafflicted body part,andlifttheboy uptothewindow, which faced thelight ofthe moon. Hewould rub the siteoftheinjuryor illness, mumble something unintelligible, look knowinglyatthe moon, andthen, after collecting hisfee, send theboyand hisfather ontheirway. Meanwhile, inthesout.h~faciug room, hiswife would bedoing the same with the 1adies~——which wasodd, really,since the moon cannotappearin twoplacesatonce; itcannot have been visible, inother words, from both windows. Apparentlythe mere thought, idea, andsymbol ofthe moon were enough, fortheladies did notcomplain,and would later remark confidentlythat thewife oftheMoon Doctor had the same healing powers ashe.
