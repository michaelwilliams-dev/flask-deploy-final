Once he had set both of these principles down, he further agreed that sometimes the stronger order those who are weaker and are ruled to do what is to the disadvantage of the stronger. On the basis of these agreements, the advantage of the stronger would be no more just than the disadvantage." "But," said Cleitophon, "he said that the advantage of the stronger is what the stronger believes to be his advantage. This is what 337.
