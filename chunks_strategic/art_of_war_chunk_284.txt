dynasty, which was a non-Chinese empire that included northern China in its territory. The Northern Qi dynasty lasted for only twenty-eight years, with six rulers of three generations. The last emperor of Northern Qi was popularly called �The Sorrowless Emperor.� He appointed dishonest and treacherous people to administer the rule of government and to sit on the board of his advisory council. All of these people had their own personal cliques, whose members thereby were given promotions that were out of order. Official posts were obtained by bribery, and people were oppressed and persecuted by arbitrary policies. There was also internecine conflict among the vassals, resulting in the judicial murder of innocent ministers.

The last emperor of Northern Qi capitulated to Northern Zhou, and his whole clan was exterminated.

General Wang said, �There have to be at least six hundred thousand.� The emperor said to General Wang, �You must be getting old! How can you be so timid?� And he appointed General Li to lead an army of two hundred thousand troops in an attack on Chu. General Wang, not having gotten the job, announced that he was ailing and went into temporary retirement. Now General Li attacked Chu and dealt the independent state a crushing blow. Then he withdrew his troops to take up a position to the west; but the men of Chu followed him, not pitching camp for three successive days, and finally routed the Qin army, killing seven captains and putting General Li to flight. Hearing news of this, the emperor was wroth. He personally went to General Wang and insisted that he return to active duty. General Wang said, �I am a muddled old man; if you
