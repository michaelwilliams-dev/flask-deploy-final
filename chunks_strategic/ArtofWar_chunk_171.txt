YOU This means that when troops are on guard in many places, they are perforce scattered into small bands. Master Sun The few are those on the defensive against others, the many are those who cause others to be on the defensive against themselves. MEI YAOCHEN The more defenses you induce your enemy to adopt, the more impoverished your enemy will be. Master Sun So if you know the place and time of battle, you can join the fight from a thousand miles away. If you do not know the place and time of battle, then your left flank cannot save your right, your right cannot save your left, your vanguard cannot save your rearguard, and your rearguard cannot save your vanguard, even in a short range of a few to a few dozen miles.

CHEN HO Do something for or against them, making opponents turn their attention to it, so that you can find out their patterns of aggressive and defensive behavior. DU MU Stir opponents up, making them respond to you; then you can observe their forms of behavior, and whether they are orderly or confused. The military wizard Wu Qi devised this strategy for assessing generals: have brave young men lead crack troops on strikes and run away after skirmishing, without being punished for running away. Then observe the enemy�s behavior�if there is orderly rule, and the enemy does not give chase to the fleeing troops and does not try to take advantage to grab what it can, this means the general has a strategy. On the other hand, if the enemy behaves like a mob, giving chase in total
