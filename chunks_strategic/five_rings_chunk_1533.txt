forfailure tosupply recognition, mymind and itscreative prod ucts, which have suppliedthefoundationuponwhich themajor portionof yourInstitute exists.” Interpretation Many harbor theillusion that science, dealingwith facts asitdoes, isbe yondthepettyrivalries that trouble therestoftheworld. Nikola Tesla was one ofthose. Hebelieved science hadnothingtodowith politics,and claimed not tocare forfame and riches. Ashegrew older, though,this ru- ined hisscientific work. Not associated withanyparticular discovery, he could attract noinvestors tohismanyideas. While hepondered greatin- ventions forthefuture, others stole thepatentshehadalready developed andgotthegloryforthemselves. Hewanted todoeverythingonhisown, butmerelyexhausted and im- poverished himselfin theprocess. Edison was Tesla’s polar opposite.Hewasn’t actually much ofascien~ tificthinker orinventor; heonce said that hehad noneed tobeamathe- matician because hecould alwayshire one. That was Fdisoifs main method. He wasreallyabusinessman andpublicist, spottingthetrends and theopportunitiesthat were outthere, thenhiringthebest inthefield todo thework forhim. Ifhehad tohewould steal from hiscompetitors.Yethis name ismuch better known than Tesla’s, and isassociated with more in- ventions. The lesson istwofold: First, thecredit for aninvention orcreation isas important, ifnot more important,than theinvention itself. You must secure thecredit foryourselfandkeep others from stealing itaway,orfrompiggy— backingonyourhard work. Toaccomplishthisyoumust alwaysbevigilant andruthless, keeping your creation quiet untilyoucanbesure there are no vultures circling overhead. Second, learn totake advantage ofotherpeo- ple’s work toFurther yourown cause. Time ispreciousand life isshort. If youtrytodoitallonyour own, yourunyourself ragged,waste energy, and burn yourselfout.Itisfarbetter toconserve your forces, pounceonthe work others have done, and find awaytomake ityourown.

These latter, less imaginative typesareoften incapable ofdoingthework that isessential for thecreation ofpower. Theyunderstand early on,though,thatiftheywait long enough, theycanalways find another animal todothework forthem. Donotbenaive: Atthisvery moment, while youareslaving awayonsome project,there arevultures circling above tryingtofigureout awaytosur- vive and even thrive offyour creativity. Itisuseless tocomplainabout this, ortowear yourself ragged with bitterness, asTesla did. Better toprotect yourselfandjointhegame. Once you have established apower base, be- come avulture yourself,and saveyourselfalotoftime andenergy. Ofthetwopoles ofthisgame,one canbeillustrated bytheexample of theexplorer Vasco Nunez deBalboa. Balboa had anobsessionw-the dis- covery ofElDorado, alegendary cityofvast riches. Earlyinthesixteenth century, after countless hardshipsand brushes with death, hefound evidence ofagreatandwealthy empiretothesouth ofMexico, inpresent—dayPeru. Byconqueringthisempire,theIncan, and seizingisgold,hewould make himself thenext Cortes. Theproblemwas that even ashemade thisdiscovery, word ofitspread amonghundreds of other conquistadors. Hedidnotunderstand thathalf thegamewaskeeping itquiet,andcarefiilly watchingthose around him. Afew years after hedis- covered thelocation oftheIncan empire,asoldier inhis ownarmy,Fran- cisco Pizarro, helpedtogethim beheaded fortreason. Pizarro went onto take what Balboa had spentsomany years tryingtofind. The other poleisthat oftheartist Peter Paul Rubens, who, late inhis career, found himself deluged with requestsforpaintings.Hecreated asys- tem: Inhislargestudio heemployeddozens ofoutstanding painters,one specializinginrobes, another inbackgrounds,and soon.Hecreated avast productionline inwhich alarge number ofcanvases would beworked on atthe same time. When animportantclient visited thestudio, Rubens would shoo hishired paintersoutfortheday. While theclient watched from abalcony,Rubens would work atanincrediblepace,with unbeliev- ableenergy. The client would leave inawe ofthisprodigious man, who could paintsomany masterpiecesinsoshort atime. This isthe essence oftheLaw: Loam togetothers todothework for youwhileyou take thecredit, andyou appeartobeofgodlike strengthand power. Ifyouthink itimportant todoallthework yourself, you will never getfar,and you will suffer thefateoftheBalboas and Teslas oftheworld. Find people with theskills andcreativity youlack. Either hire them, while
