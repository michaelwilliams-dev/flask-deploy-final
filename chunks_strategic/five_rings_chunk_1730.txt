Observance II Earlyoninhiscareer, theambitious statesman andgeneral Alcibiades of Athens (450—404 8.0) fashioned aformidableweaponthat became the source ofhispower. Inevery encounter with others, hewould sense their moods and tastes, then carefullytailor hiswords and actions tomirror their inmost desires. Hewould seduce them with theidea that their values were superiortoeveryone else’s, and that hisgoalwas tomodel himself onthem orhelpthem realize their dreams. Few could resist hischarm. The first man tofallunder hisspellwas thephilosopher Socrates. Al- cibiades represented theopposite oftheSocratic ideal ofsimplicityandup- rightness:Helived lavishlyand wascompletely unprincipled. Whenever hemet Socrates, however, hemirrored theolder man’s sobriety, eating simply, accompanyingSocrates onlong walks, andtalking only ofphiloso- phyand virtue. Socrates was notcompletelyfooled——he was not unaware ofAlcibiades’ other life. Butthatonlymade him vulnerable toalogic that flattered him: Onlyinmypresence,hefelt, does this man submit toa.virtu- ousinfluence; onlyIhave suchpowerover him. This feelingintoxicated Socrates, who became Alcibiades’ fervent admirer andsupporter,oneday even riskinghis own lifetorescue theyoungman inbattle. The Athenians considered Alcibiades their greatest orator, forhehad anuncanny abilitytotune intohisaudience’s aspirations,and mirror their desires. Hemade hisgreatest speechesinsupportoftheinvasion ofSicily, which hethought would bring greatwealth toAthens and limitless glory to himself. The speeches gave expressiontoyoungAthenians’ thirst tocom querlands forthemselves, rather thanliving offthevictories oftheir a.nces~ tors. But healso tailored hiswords toreflect older men's nostalgia forthe glory yearswhen Athens ledtheGreeks against Persia, and then went onto create anempire. AllAthens now dreamed ofconquering Sicily; Alcibi- ades’ planwasapproved,and hewas made theexpedition’s commander. While Alcibiades wasleading theinvasion ofSicily, however, certain Athenians fabricated charges againsthim ofprofaningsacred statues. He knew hisenemies would have him executed ifhereturned home, soatthe lastminute hedeserted theAthenian fleet and defected toAthens’s bitter enemy, Sparta.TheSpartanswelcomed thisgreatman totheir side, but theyknew hisreputation and werewary ofhim.
