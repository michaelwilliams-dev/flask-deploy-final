although Machiavelli's contem.poraries apparently found nothing them shock their con- in to science. The Church attacked the book on the ground that it was irreligious, and in 1553 it was placed on the Index, together with all Machiavelli's other works; for while Machiavelli did in fact maintain the necessity of some form of religion and of the strict observance of its rites and ceremonies as being essential for the stability of a state, was impossible to look upon the rules of it conduct he recommended as anything but anti-Christian. But The Prince is not concerned with either religion or moral.ity, as Machiavelli would have been the first to point out; it deals with the science of practical government, and the problem is to form a just estimate of the truth or falsity of Machiavelli's propo.sitions. How do the methods of government advocated by Ma.chiavelli work in practice? Is his psychology sound? Is his view of the inherent baseness of human nature correct? How far have his rules of conduct been adopted with success by such modern creators of new states as Bismarck, Lenin and Mussolini? These are the questions, amongst many others, which suggest them.selves to the critical reader, and to which each must find his own answer. Machiavelli's personal character no longer needs be de. to fended. That he was licentious, at any rate by modern standards, must be admitted, and no doubt he was a master diplomatic of dissimulation (if that is a fault), but in an age of general corrup.he to in tion appears have been exceptionally honest and direct his dealings, and it has been truly said that no one was less Ma.chiavellian than Machiavelli. No dishonorable deed nor any act of self-interest in his official career was ever imputed to him; and THE PRINCE ï¿½ 23 his writings show that, however much to his interest it may have been to write in support of the powers of the day, he was invaria.bly true to his own ideals, and that, at a time when he was hoping to obtain employment from the Medici, he had no hesitation in at.tacking the corruption and ambitious territorial policy of the Pa.pal Court as being one of the main causes of all Italy's misfor.tunes. The most complete account Machiavelli's life and works of will be found in Villari's Life and Times of Machiavelli (2nd edi.tion, 1892); shorter reviews in Macaulay's Essay on Machiavelli, and Mr. Henry Cust's introduction to Machiavelli's works in in The Tudor Translations (1905). In the Introduction to his anno.tated edition of I1 Principe (1891), Mr. L. A. Burd considers at length the true purpose of The Prince, and surveys the early criti.cism of the work. W. E. C.
