Thrasymachus, with histraining inrhetoric, also offers the means ofattaining theobject heproposes, and Socrates hasno substitute forthat.Butthevery attractiveness of'thegoalproposed causes them toneglect itsimpracticality. Socrates succeeds withthem because hebegins bygiving them atleast partofwhat theywant. Soc- rates takes Glaucon andAdeimantus tothelimits ofpolitics, and itis atthelimits thatonecanseeboth thenature andtheproblems of politics. Wehave learned thatjustice isapolitical question: canthere bearegime whose laws aresuch astoserve thecommon good while allowing each ofitsmembers toreach hisnatural perfection? Ifnot, life [343 ] THEREPUBLIC willbeeternally tornbetween duty tothecityandduty tooneself. In pretending thatthey arefounders, Glaucon andAdeimantus atonce discover thattheymust care forjustice. Inthiscase atleast, the satisfaction oftheir desires isidentical with theconcern forjustice. Socrates, momentarily atleast, accepts Glaucon's view thatthings canbeunderstood bytheir origins. They areabout towatch justice coming intobeing inorder tosee ifGlaucon's account wascorrect. The decision tolook forjustice inacity first,andtheconsequent distinction between justice inacityandjustice inanindividual man,keep con- stantly before usthequestion whether thejustice which makes acity healthy isthesame asthatwhich makes amanhealthy. Ontheanswer tothisquestion depends theanswer tothequestion whether itisad- vantageous foraman todevote himself tothe city.Wemust first discover what ahealthy city isandwhat ahealthy soul is.Thevery coming toawareness ofsuch acityandsoultransforms andeducates theseyoung men. , (369]?-372e) The first city isconstructed bySocrates andAdei- mantus, without thehelp ofGlaucon. Thus itreflects thetastes of Adeimantus. Itisaneasy place: there isnoscarcity, andjustice takes careofitself.Men jointogether because they areincomplete, because theycannot provide fortheir needs themselves. Their intention isnot tohavemore than others buttohaveenough forthemselves. Aslong as there isnoscarcity they willbepeacefol, andthe arts,with the cooperation ofnature, produce enough tocontent them. Eachman chooses anartaccording tohisnatural capacities sothatnothing inlife goes against thegrain oftheinhabitants' desires ortalents. Each con- tributes according tohisability andreceives according tohisneeds. In such acity,there isanimmediate identity between selfish interest and thecommon good.Hence there isnoneed formen tobegoverned. The city isreally theperfect community ofartisans envisaged inthediscus- sionwithThrasymachus, foreachmandevotes himself exclusively to hisown art,hisowngood resulting from thatdedication. Theinvention ofmoney makes thispossible. Inthiscity itisnotofvalue initselfand isnotpursued asanend initself. Thatdevelopment would betheresult ofinflamed desires. Heremoney simply facilitates exchange sothat every artisan, asaresult ofpracticing hisown art,willhave access to theproducts oftheother arts.There isnoseparate wage-earner's art, foreach artbyitselfproduces theequivalent ofmoney; andthere isno need ofanorganizing principle other than thatprovided bymoney, which represents theneeds ofthebody. Itsetsthevarious artsand ar- [344 ] Interpretive Essay tisans inmotion intheservice ofsatisfying those needs. This isacity which takes thebodily needs astheonly realones;andwhatever efforts ofthesoulandintelligence itcalls intoplay areentirely directed tothe preservation andcomfort ofthebody. Bymeans oftheexample ofthis city, Socrates, inopposition to Glaucon, suggests thatthebodily desires areverysimple andeasy to satisfy. Inthisheisnotunlike Rousseau inhisopposition toHobbes. Themore complicated desires, theones thatcause theinjustice of which Glaucon hasspoken, aretheresult ofamixture ofthedesires of thebody withthedesires ofthesoul.Although theentrance ofthese de- siresconnected withthesoulserves tocorrupt this first city,Socrates looks onthem withmore favor thandoesRousseau, fortheyarethe firstmani- festations ofalonging foranatural perfection higher than thatofthe body; headmits Glaucon's dissatisfaction asalegitimate objection to this city.Glaucon isamanofintense desires, andhisdaring isinthe service ofthose desires. He is,touseSocratic language, anerotic man, onewho lusts tohave ashisown allthings which appear beautiful and good. Hisdesires areinchoate expressions ofhisinclination toafulfill- ment ofwhich heisasyetunaware. Hisview ofnature isactually a conventional one,ignorant ofthedistinction between thebodyandthe soulandofthedistinct anddivergent demands ofthetwo.Anatural man, forhim,pursues thesame
