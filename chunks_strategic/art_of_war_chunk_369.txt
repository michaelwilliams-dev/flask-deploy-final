you will not be able to understand the sword well, and you will be far from being in accord with the principles of strategy. There are people who make a profession out of selling the arts. They treat themselves as articles of merchandise and produce objects with a view to selling them. This attitude is tantamount to the act of separating the flower from the fruit. And it must be said that the fruit in this case does not amount to much. They adorn the way of strategy with flowery colors, lay out a display of techniques, and teach their way by creating first one dojo, then another. Someone who might want to learn such a way with the goal of making money should keep in mind the saying �Strategy, inadequately learned, is the cause of serious wounds.�18 In general, four ways exist for traversing human life: those of the warrior, the peasant, the artisan, and the merchant.19 The first is the way of the peasant. Peasants prepare various tools and are vigilant with regard to the changing of the seasons, year after year. That is the way of the peasant. The second is the way of the merchant. A manufacturer of sake, for example, buys the necessary materials and makes profits that correspond to the quality of his product�this is the way he goes through life. All merchants pass through human life making more or less profit from their businesses. That is the way of business. The third is the way of the warrior. Warriors must make various weapons and know the richness20 of each weapon. That is the way of the warrior. Without learning how to handle weapons, without knowing the advantages of each of them, a warrior is lacking somewhat in education. The fourth is the way of the artisan. A carpenter follows his way by skillfully making various tools and knowing well how to use them. He correctly lays out construction plans using black cords and a square.21 He goes through life with his art without wasting a moment. This is the way the four ways should be, those of the warrior, the peasant, the artisan, and the merchant. I am going to speak of strategy by comparing it to the way of the carpenter. This comparison has to do with a house constructed by carpenters. We speak, for example, of a noble house, a warrior house,22 or the Four Houses.23 We also speak of the decline or continuation of a house; in the realm of art, we also speak of a house in the sense of a school or a style.24 It is because the term house is used in these ways that I make the comparison with the way of the carpenter. The word daiku, carpenter, is written dai, �fully,� ku, �to be very clever at.� In the same way, the way of strategy is built upon ingenuity of great fullness and scope. That is why I compare it to the way of the
