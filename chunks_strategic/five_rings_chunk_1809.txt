good orbadfortune. This made himvenerated andterrible inthe eyes ofhissoldiers. Without thisfear, hisother virtues would not have been enough. Historians don't realize this, andwhile they praise hisvirtues, they wrongly condemn thesource ofhis strength. That hisother virtues would nothave sufficed, canbeshown byconsidering Scipio (236-183 B.C., victor over Hannibal), a rare figure inhisown times andanexception inalltimes. In Spain, hisarmy rebelled against him. This came from nothing other than hisexcessive compassion, which gave histroops more license than military discipline. ForthisFabio Massimo reproved himintheSenate andcalled himacorruptor oftheRoman mili- tia.When hisLocrensi were destroyed byafalse legate andnot vindicated byScipio orthelegate chastised, itwas because of Scipio's easy nature. Somuch sothatintheSenate some defend- erswho really should have known better, butwanting toexcuse him, said heshould correct hisways. This nature ofhiswould have intime wrecked Scipio's reputation ifhehadaspired tobe Emperor, but,since heremained loyal under thesenate, thisdan- gerous virtue ofhisnotonly didn't harm himbutalsoadded tohis glory. Iconclude thatastobeing feared orloved thatbeing loved makes youdepend onothers while being feared helps youdepend onyourself sothataPrince should relyonhimself, andnoton others. Allheneeds todoisavoid being hated. EHOW APRINCE SHOULD UPHOLD FAITH veryone feels thataPrince should keep theFaith andlive byhonesty andnotbyastuteness. Nevertheless, onesees thatPrinces who have done great things inourtimes have held theFaith inlow regard. They have rather bytheir wits known how togetaround men. Intheend, they overcame men who remained loyal. There aretwoways tofight: with laws, andwith force. The firstisrightly theman's way; thesecond isthewayofbeasts. Of- tenthefirstwayisnotenough anditisnecessary toresort tothe second. APrince hastoknow how tomanage beasts andmen. Theancient writers deal thiswith Indirectly. They saythatAchil- lesandmany other ancient Princes were given tofeeding Chiron theCentaur, whom they kept watch over. This means they held upChiron asanexample ofnature, halfhuman andhalfbeast— onewithout theother wasnotviable. APrince needs toknow bestial nature anddifferentiate be- tween thelion andthefox. The lion cannot keep away from snares; thefoxcan't defend itself from wolves. You need tobea foxtoknow snares, aliontoscare wolves. Hewho justknows li- onsdoesn't understand. Aprudent man cannot relyongood faith norshould hewhen such observance turns against himorunder- mines thereasons themselves forobserving it.Ifmen were all good, thispercept would notmatter. Because men areimperfect anddon't keep faith with you, neither must youkeep itwith them. APrince willnever lack reasons tobreak good faith. One could give infinite modern examples andshow how often peace and promises have been nullified bytheunfaithfulness ofPrinces. He who knew buthow toplay thefoxcame outbest. Butitisbestto temper anddisguise thisnature, tobeanactor anddissembler. THE PRINCE —97 Men aresosimple andobey their present needs somuch thatwho deceives willeasily findsomeone todeceive. Iwillgive oneexample: Alexander VI,who never didany- thing elsethan deceive men, always found victims. Noman ever swore tomore things andbetrayed hispromises more. Hisruses were always successful because heunderstood thisside ofthe world well. ThePrince needs notalways dothis, butmust appear tohave these qualities. Topractice deceit isharmful; appearing to have these qualities isuseful asitistoappear compassionate, faithful, human, honest andreligious, andatthesame time be able tochange totheopposite. Hemust know thataPrince, and particularly anew Prince, cannot always observe those qualities thatmen hold well since, inorder tomaintain thestate asneeded, hemay have toactcontrary togood faith, charity, humanity, and religion. Thus heneeds tohave avariable nature capable of changing with thewinds offortune andsituations, andknow how toactnotjustbythegood but,ifneed be,bythebad. SoaPrince needs totakecare
