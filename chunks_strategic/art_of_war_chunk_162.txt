leader of wisdom and ability lays deep plans for what other people do not figure on. This is why Sun Tzu speaks of being unknowable as the dark. Master Sun In ancient times those known as good warriors prevailed when it was easy to prevail. CAO CAO Find out the subtle points over which it is easy to prevail, attack what can be overcome, do not attack what cannot be overcome. DU MU When the strategy of opponents first makes an appearance, you operate secretly in such a way as to be able to attack it. Since the effort used is little, and your assurance of victory is done in a subtle way, it is said to be easy to prevail. ZHANG YU If you are only able to ensure victory after engaging an opponent in armed conflict, that victory is a hard one. If you see the subtle and notice the hidden, breaking through before formation, that victory is an easy one. Master Sun Therefore the victories of good warriors are not noted for cleverness or bravery. Therefore their victories in battle are not flukes. Their victories are not flukes because they position themselves where they will surely win, prevailing over those who have already lost.

Master Sun So it is that good warriors take their stand on ground where they cannot lose, and do not overlook conditions that make an opponent prone to defeat. LI QUAN The army that finds its ground flourishes, the army that loses its ground perishes. Here the ground means a place of strategic importance. DU MU Ground where one cannot lose means invincible strategy that makes it impossible for opponents to defeat you. Not overlooking conditions that make opponents prone to defeat means spying out the enemies� vulnerabilities, not missing any of them. Master Sun Therefore a victorious army first wins and then seeks battle; a defeated army first battles and then seeks victory. CAO CAO This is the difference between those with strategy and those without forethought. HO YANXI In a military operation, first determine a winning strategy, and only then send forth the troops.
