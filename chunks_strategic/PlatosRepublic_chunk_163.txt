If that were the case we would justly be laughed at for uselessly saying things that are like prayers. Or isn't that so?'' "Yes, it is." "Therefore, if, in the endless time that has gone by, there has been some necessity for those who are on the peaks of philosophy to take charge of a city, or there even now is such a necessity in some barbaric p1ace somewhere far outside of our range of vision, or will be later, in this case we are ready to do battle for the argument that the regime spoken of has been, is, and will be when this Muse has become master of a city.
