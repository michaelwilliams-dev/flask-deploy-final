But, asSocrates willshow, thisartisan of selfish satisfaction isreally notinharmony with thevulgar tastes Thra- symachus isalsocommitted tosupporting. Itisbydeveloping thiscon- tradiction thatSocrates willbeable totame thewild beast. Thrasymachus could easily have circumvented the difficulty which Socrates presents. Thecrude Clitophon, who enters todefend Thrasymachus, shows Polemarchus(who isnqy^Socrates' allyandde- feijder) howobvious thisroute is.Thrasymachus hadonly tosay, as Clitophon insists hemeant, thatjustice iswhat appears tobethead- vantage ofthe stronger. This position iscldse tothat oflegal positivism: thejust iswhat thecitysays isjustandnothing more. Clito- phon asserts thelaws established bytherulers arebased ontheir ap- parent advantage. This position maynotbetruebut itdoesnotdefy common sense, and itseems based ontheactual practice ofcities.The thesis merely asserts thattheonly source andsanction oflaw isthe sovereign andthat itishence benighted tolook forhigher justification. There isnoneed todefine rulers byanycriterion other than theirhav- ingthepower tomake laws inthecity,andthequestion ofwhat istruly advantageous issetaside. Clitophon's solution toSocrates' difficulty doesnotcontain those internal contradictions which bring about Thra- symachus' downfall. Thrasymachus, however, chooses torespond toSocrates' objection byarguing thattheruler isalways rightandknows hisownadvantage. The rulerwhomakes mistakes isnotaruler; that is,almost allrulers arenotreally rulers. Itisnotthat rulers dobehave with scientific selfishness butthatthey should. Thrasymachus, asitwere, anticipates Socrates' bestregime bydeveloping analternative opposed toit.Asin Socrates' good city,where rulers willbetrained who areperfectly public-spirited, soinThrasymachus' there willberulerswho areper- fectly selfish; therulers inbothregimes dohave incommon, however, thefactthatthey areknowers. Thrasymachus' regime isasimprobable andopposed toexperience asisSocrates'. Rather than defend the plausible observation that rulers ofselfish intention arethesource of law,Thrasymachus encumbers himself with theresponsibility forwhat amounts toamoral imperative, requiring rulers tobeselfish with per- fectknowledge. Why doesThrasymachus doso?Inthe firstplace, hehassimply thought through theconsequences ofhisposition, unlike theadvocates ofacrude positivism. Iflawhasnodeeper authority thanhuman con- [329 1 THEREPUBLIC vention, anymanwho reflects atallonwhat kind oflifeheshould liverealizes hecannot relyonthelawforguidance. Everyman rea- sonably pursues hisowngood, and, ifthere isnocommon good, hewill properly usethelawforhisownprivate satisfaction. This isthelesson which theindividual canwelldraw from theteaching thatlaw isnoth- ingmore than thesovereign's will;andtheintelligent tyrant seems to betheonewhohasbestlearned thelesson. Theruler ishence aman who seeks hisownadvantage; todosoisalmost theonly alternative, since other goals areillusory. Ifhefails toattain it,heisafailure asa rulerandaman.Thrasymachus looks atpolitics from thepoint ofview ofthemanwhowants tolivewellandhasunderstood thenature of justice; itisthisperspective which causes himtogobeyond Clitophon's formulation. Further, totheextent that inthisdrama Thrasymachus plays the roleofthecity,heechoes thecity's insistence that itknows thetruth. Forthecitycould hardly admit that itslaws areessentially fallible. Its pronouncements mustbeauthoritative, and allknowledge, divine or human, must beratified and codified bythesovereign. Ithas a monopoly ofwisdom. Otherwise every individual would haveanap- pealfrom it. And, finally, Thrasymachus asthepractitioner andteacher ofan art,onewhich hebelieves tobethemost important artformenwho want tolive agood life,mustmake aclaim himself topossess knowledge andtobeable toconvey thatknowledge toothers. AsSoc- rates suggests, he isinAthens looking forstudents, whose money he needs inorder tolive.Hedirects hisappeal tonoble, political youths of high ambition. They wish toberulers. But ifthere isnoarttheposses- sionofwhich makes aman arulerandenables himtoattain thegood sought forintheactivity ofruling, whatwould Thrasymachus have to teach them? Clitophon's argument implies thattheruler isdefined only byholding office, notbyanyparticular skillwhich giveshim the capacity toattain hisend.Thiswould bedisastrous forThrasymachus' profession. Hetherefore claims heteaches askillwhich canmakemen rulers, inthesense thatthey willbeable tofulfill their wishes.
