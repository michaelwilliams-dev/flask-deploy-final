Southern Italywas controlled bySpainatthetime, and inNaples Campanellabecame involved inaplot tofightand throw out these in» vaders. Hishopewas toestablish anindependent republicbased onhis own ideas ofutopia.The leaders oftheItalian Inquisition, working with their Spanish counterparts,hadhimimprisoned again.This time theyalso tortured him, todiscover thetrue nature ofhisimpious beliefs: He was sub- jected totheinfamous lazzeglia,atorture inwhich hewassuspended byhis arms inasquatting positionafewinches above aseat studded with spikes. The posturewasimpossibletosustain, and intime thevictim would endup sittingonthespikes,which would tear hisflesh attheslightest contact. During these years, however, Campanella learned something about power. Facingtheprospectofexecution forheresy,hechangedhis s|:a.t~ egy: Hewould not renounce hisbeliefs, yetheknew hehad todisguise their outwardappearance. To save hislife,Campanella feigned madness. Helethisinquisifors imaginethax hisbeliefs stemmed from aninconuollable unsoundness of mind. For awhile thetortures continued, toseeifhisinsanitywas faked, butin1603 his sentence was commuted tolife inprison.The first four years ofthis hespentchained toawall inanunderground dungeon.De» spite such conditions, hecontinued towrite--althoughnolonger would he besofoolish astoexpresshisideas directly. One book ofCa.mpa.uella’s,771::Hispanic Monardzy, promoted theidea thatSpainhad adivine. mission toexpanditspowers around theworld, and offered theSpanish king practical, Machiavelli-typeadvice forachiev- ingthis.Despitehis own interest inMachiavelli, thebook ingeneral pre sented ideas completelytheoppositetohisown. TheHispanirr Monarchywas infact aploy,anattempttoshow hisconversion toorthodoxyinthebold- estmanner possible. Itworked: In1626, sixyearsafter itspublication, the pope finallyletCampanella outofprison. Shortlyafier gaininghisfreedom, Campanella wrote Atheism Con» guered,abook attacking ‘free-thinkers, Machiavellians, Calvinists, and heretics ofallstripes.The book iswritten intheform ofdebates inwhich heretics express their beliefs and arecountered byarguments forthesupe riority ofCatholicism. Campanella had obviously reformed-his book made that clear. Ordidit? The argumentsinthemouths oftheheretics had never before been expressedwith such verve and freshness. Pretendingtopresent their side onlytoknock itdown, Campanella actuallysummarized the case against Caxholicism with striking passion.“Then heargued theother side, suppos- edlyhisside, ontheother hand, heresorted tostale clichés and convoluted rationales. Brief andeloquent, theheretics’ arguments seemed bold and sincere. Thelengthy arguments forCatholicism seemed tiresome and 1m» convincing. Catholics who read thebook found itdisturbing andambiguous,but theycould notclaim itwas heretical, orthatCampanellashould be re- turned toprison.His defense ofCatholicism, after all,used arguments they hadused themselves. Yetintheyears tocome, Atizeism Conquered became a bible foratheists, Machiavellians and liberfines who used thearguments Campanellahadputintheir mouths todefend their dangerous ideas. Com- bininganoutward display ofconformity with anexpressionofhistrue he» liefsinawaythat hissympathizerswould understand, Campanella showed thathehad learned hislesson. Interpretation Intheface ofawesome persecution, Campanella devised three strate- gicmoves that saved hishide, freed him from prison,and allowed him to continue toexpresshisbeliefs. First hefeignedma.dness—«the medieval equivalent ofdisavowing responsibilityfor one’s actions, likeblaming one’s parents today. Next hewrote abook thatexpressedthe exactoppo- siteofhis own beliefs. Finally, and most brilliantly ofall,hedisguisedhis ideas while insinuatingthem atthe same time.
