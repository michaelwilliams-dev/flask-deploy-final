aware, nobody has yet pointed out. There are two passages in Sun Tzu in which he alludes to contemporary affairs. The first in in VI. ss. 21: Though according to my estimate the soldiers of Yueh exceed our own in number, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory. I say then that victory can be achieved. The other is in XI. ss. 30: Asked if an army can be made to imitate the SHUAI-JAN, I should answer, Yes. For the men of Wu and the men of Yueh are enemies; yet if they are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a storm, they will come to each other�s assistance just as the left hand helps the right. These two paragraphs are extremely valuable as evidence of the date of composition. They assign the work to the period of the struggle between Wu and Yueh. So much has been observed by Pi I-hsun. But what has hitherto escaped notice is that they also seriously impair the credibility of Ssu-ma Ch�ien�s narrative. As we have seen above, the first positive date given in connection with Sun Wu is 512 B.C. He is then spoken of as a general, acting as confidential adviser to Ho Lu, so that his alleged introduction to that monarch had already taken place, and of course the 13 chapters must have been written earlier still. But at that time, and for several years after, down to the capture of Ying in 506, Ch�u and not Yueh, was the great hereditary enemy of Wu. The two states, Ch�u and Wu, had been constantly at war for over half a century, 30 whereas the first war between Wu and Yueh was waged only in 510, 31 and even then was no more than a short interlude sandwiched in the midst of the fierce struggle with Ch�u. Now Ch�u is not mentioned in the 13 chapters at all. The natural inference is that they were written at a time when Yueh had become the prime antagonist of Wu, that is, after Ch�u had suffered the great humiliation of 506. At this point, a table of dates may be found useful. 30When Wu first appears in the CH�UN CH�IU in 584, it is already at variance with its powerful neighbor. The CH�UN CH�IU first mentions Yueh in 537, the TSO CHUAN in 601. 31This is explicitly stated in the TSO CHUAN, XXXII, 2. CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 14 B.C. 514 Accession of Ho Lu. 512 Ho Lu attacks Ch�u, but is dissuaded from entering Ying, | the capital. SHI CHI 511 Another attack on Ch�u. 510 Wu makes a successful attack on Yueh. This is the first war between 508 or 509 Ch�u invades Wu, but is signally defeated at Yu-chang 506 Ho Lu attacks Ch�u with the aid of T�ang and Ts�ai. Decisive battle of Po-chu, and capture of Yi 505 Yueh makes a raid on Wu in the absence of its army. Wu
