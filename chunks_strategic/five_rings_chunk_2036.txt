hated, anddoevery terrible deed. Insum,heisthe least self-sufficient ofmen, utterly dependent onexternal things and thus fullofanxiety. Second, thetyrannic life isnotthepleasantest life.The latter argument isagain divided intotwoparts. According to the first,eachofthethree parts ofthesoulhas itsown specific pleasure. Themanwhoknows allthree pleasures would bethebestjudge of which isthegreatest pleasure. Only thephilosopher knows allthree, however, andhechooses thepleasure ofphilosophy. According tothe second partoftheargument, thetyrant's pleasures are allmixed and allied topain, while thephilosophic pleasures arepure.The tyrant's pleasures areunreal because theyarelinked tobecoming which isitself somehow unreal; thephilosopher isattached tobeing, andhence his pleasures arereal. Itwillbenoted thatSocrates makes thechoice be- tween tyranny andphilosophy depend onpleasure. This aspect oftheteaching oftheRepublic ispowerfully pre- sented byAristotle inPolitics (II, vii).Incriticizing aneconomic solu- [424 ] Interpretive Essay tionofthe political problem advanced byPhaleas ofChalcedon, Aristotle asserts thatthere arethree causes ofmen's doing injustice: want ofthenecessities, desire formore thanwhat isnecessary, and desire toenjoy independent pleasures which arepureandunmixed with pain. InSocrates' presentation theoligarch ispreoccupied with thenecessary, thedemocrat withtheunnecessary, andthetyrant with theunlawful pleasures. Aristotle explicitly identifies themanwhowish- esthepleasures which havenoadmixture ofpainwith theonewho commits thegreatest crimes andlongs fortyranny. Healsoindicates that this isthemost interesting kind ofman.Hesuggests three cures for thethree causes ofinjustice: asmall amount ofproperty andwork, moderation, andphilosophy. The quest forpure pleasures isthe motivation ofthehigher kind offreemanwhonolonger hastoworry about thenecessary. But thisquest canonlybefulfilled through philosophy because "the other [pleasures] require htiman beings." Only philosophy ispurepleasure and isself-sufficient, notentailing the useofothermen.Most radically posed, themoral problem consists ina simple alternative: either philosophy ortyranny isthebestwayoflife. Other solutions areonlyhalfway measures. Ifphilosophy didnotexist, tyranny would bethedesideratum which only alackofvigorwould cause onetoreject. This choice between thephilosophic andtyrannic lives explains theplotoftheRepublic. Socrates takes ayoungmantempted bythe tyrannic lifeandattempts togivehim atleast thatmodicum of awareness ofphilosophy which willcurehimofthelustfortyranny. Anyother exhortation would amount toempty moralism. Theyoung mandrawn totyranny istheillustration ofAristotle's maxims thatman isboth thebestandtheworst ofanimals, andthattheman living out- sidethecity (inthesense ofnotparticipating initslaw)mustbeeither agodorabeast. IntheRepublic Socrates hasincluded bothgodandbeast inthecity,andthisaccounts forthedifference between hispolitical sci- enceand Aristotle's. Socrates, unlike Aristotle, makes eras apolitical principle. Although tyranny andthetyrannic man areinoneway thefurthest from philosophy, they areinanother thenearest toit. This iswhySocrates isattracted tothose dangerous young men, thepo- tential tyrants, who areproducts ofthedemocracy. Withsome ofthese young men (forexample, Critias andAlcibiades) histraining failed, andasaresult hewascondemned. Butwith others (forexample, Xeno- phonandPlato) hesucceeded, andtheyhave exculpated him. Since thetimewhen Glaucon firstasked foracomparison ofthe lives ofthejustandunjust men, theaction oftheRepublic hassteadily moved toward it.Thequestion haschanged enroute, forthecompari- [425 ] THEREPUBLIC son isnowbetween thephilosopher andthetyrant; thiswould nothave satisfied Glaucon atthebeginning, nordoes itprove thesuperiority of justice over injustice, unless justice isphilosophy andinjustice tyranny. Butsuch acomparison does cast lightontheoriginal problem; al- though thejustmanontherack isnotproved tobehappy, itisclear thathappiness doesnotdepend onanything tyranny canacquire. Glau- con's notion ofthegood things hasbeen altered bythemarvelous things hehasexperienced inthisconversation. Previously hethought thatboth justandunjustmandesired thesame things; nowheseesthe possibility ofalife—the lifeofSocrates— which isself-sufficient and happy. Theneedfulness oftyranny hasbecome questionable, andGlau- conwillnever again beable toposetheproblem asheonce did.Hap- piness isnotconnected with theexploitation ofotherhuman beings. Socrates makes animage ofthesoul forGlaucon's benefit; thedesiring part iscompared toamany-headed beast, thespirited part toalion, andtherational part toaman. Socrates thus explains thatthelaws which impose moderation arenotmade intheinterest ofanexploiter butintheinterest ofthesoul asopposed tothebody, ofreason asop- posed todesire. This would, ofcourse, hold trueonly inthebest regime, butGlaucon himself isnowable tosaythatthatmakes nodif- ference.
