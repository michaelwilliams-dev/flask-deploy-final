men, inturn,when they areover thirty, you willgive pref- erence among thepreferred andassign greater honors; andyoumust [216] BookVII/536d-538c socrates/glaucon consider, testing them with thepower ofdialectic, who isable to 537d release himself from theeyesandtherestofsenseandgotothatwhich isinitselfandaccompanies truth.And here,mycomrade, youhave a jobrequiring agreat dealofguarding." "Ofwhat inparticular?" hesaid. "Don't younotice," Isaid,"how great istheharm coming from e thepractice ofdialectic these days?" "What's that?" hesaid. "Surely itsstudents," Isaid, "are filled fullwith lawlessness." - "Verymuch so,"hesaid. "Doyousuppose it'sanywonder," Isaid, "that they aresoaf- fected, anddon'tyousympathize?" "Why exactly should I?"hesaid. "It islikethecaseofchangeling child," Isaid, "reared inmuch wealth, inanumerous andgreat family amidst many flatterers, whoon 538a reaching manhood becomes aware thathedoes riotbelong tothese pre- tended parents and isn'table tofindthosewho really gavehim birth. Canyoudivine howhewould bedisposed toward theflatterers and toward thosewhomade thechange, inthetimewhen hedidn'tknow about thechange, andthenagainwhenhedidknow it?Ordoyouwant tolisten while Idothedivining?" "That's what Iwant," hesaid. "Well, then," Isaid, "Idivine that inthetimewhen hedoesn't know thetruth hewould bemore likely tohonor hisfather and his b mother andtheothers whoseem tobehiskinthan thosewho flatter him.Andhewould belesslikely tooverlook anyoftheir needs, less likely todoorsayanything unlawful tothem, andlesslikely todisobey them intheimportant things than theflatterers." "That's tobeexpected," hesaid. "And,when hehasbecome aware ofthatwhich is,Idivine that nowhewould relax hishonor andzeal forthese people andintensify them fortheflatterers, bepersuaded bythem agreat dealmore than before, andbegin toliveaccording totheirways, andhaveunconcealed c relations withthem. Forthat father andtherestoftheadoptive kin, unless heisbynature particularly decent, hewouldn't care." "Everything yousay,"hesaid, "isjustthesortofthing thatwould happen. Buthowdoes thisimage apply tothosewho takeupargu- ments?" "Like this. Surely wehave from childhood convictions about what's justand fairbywhichwearebrought upasbyparents, obeying them asrulers andhonoring them."

"That's so." "Then what?" Isaid."When aquestion isposed andcomes tothe manwho issodisposed, 'What isthefair?'— and afteranswering what heheard from thelawgiver, theargument refutes him,andrefuting him many times andinmany ways, reduces him totheopinion thatwhat e thelawsays isnomore fairthan ugly,andsimilarly about thejustand goodandthethings heheldmost inhonor— after that,whatdoyou suppose he'lldoabout honoring andobeying asrulers thethings he heard from thelawgiver?" "Necessarily," hesaid, "he'll neither honor norobey them any longer inthesame way." "Then," Isaid,"when hedoesn't believe, ashedidbefore, that these things arehonorable orakin tohim,anddoesn't findthetrue ones, isittobeexpected thathewillgotoanyother sortoflifethan the 539a onethat flatters him?"^^ "No, itisn't," hesaid.

"Isn't ittobeexpected," Isaid, "that this iswhat willhappen to thosewhotakeupthestudy ofarguments inthisway;andasIwas just saying, don't theydeserve much sympathy?" "And pity, too,"hesaid.

"They certainly have," hesaid, "apreternatural tendency inthat direction." "Then when theythemselves refutemanymenandarerefuted by c many, they fallquickly intoaprofound disbelief ofwhat theyformerly [218] BookVIII538c-540b socrates/glaucon believed.
