thousand criminals to give an appearance of disorder so as to lure Yue. Some of the criminals ran, some of them gave up; the Yue army fought with them, only to be defeated by the army of Wu. Master Sun When they are fulfilled, be prepared against them; when they are strong, avoid them. DU MU If the enemy�s government is fulfilled�meaning that there is mutual love between the rulers and the ruled, there is clarity and trustworthiness in the system of rewards and punishments, and the soldiers are well trained�then you should be on guard against them. Do not wait for a clash to make your preparations. When the enemy�s military is strong, you should avoid them for the time being, waiting until they slack off, watching for an opening to attack. CHEN HAO If the enemy does not stir, is complete and fulfilled, then you should prepare carefully. Fulfill yourself too, so as to be ready for them.

DU MU When their military leadership is obstreperous, you should irritate them to make them angry�then they will become impetuous and ignore their original strategy.

ZHANG YU If they are violent and easily angered, then use embarrassment to enrage them, so that their morale is upset�then they will proceed carelessly, without formulating a plan. Master Sun Use humility to make them haughty. LI QUAN If they ply you with expensive gifts and sweet talk, they are up to something. DU YOU When they are stirred up and about to make their move, then you should pretend to be cowed, so as to raise their spirits; wait for them to slack off, then regroup and attack. MEI YAOCHEN Give the appearance of inferiority and weakness, to
