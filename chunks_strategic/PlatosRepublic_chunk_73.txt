though he himself were Chryses and tries as hard as he can to make it seem to us that it's not Homer speaking, but the priest. an old man. And in this way he made pretty nearly all the rest of the narrative about the events in Ilium as well as about those in Ithaca and the whole Odyssey." "Most certainly," he said. "Isn't it narrative when he gives aH the speeches and also what comes between the speeches?" "Of course." "But, when he gives a speech as though he were someone else, won't we say that he then likens his own style as much as possible to that of the man he has announced as the speaker?" "We'll say that, surely." "Isn't likening himself to someone else, either in voice or in looks, the same as imitating the man he likens himself to?" "Surely." ï¿½ "Then, in this case, it seems, he and the other poets use imitation in making their narrative." 386. C d e 386. a b C 393 C d e 394 a b C "Most certainly." "If the poet nowhere hid himself, his poetic work and narrative as a whole would have taken place without imitation. So that you won't. say you don't understand again, I'll tell you how this would be. If Homer said that Chryses came bringing ransom for his daughter and as a suppliant to the Achaeans, especially to the kings, and after that didn't speak as though he had become Chryses but still as Homer, you know that it wouldn't be imitation but simple narrative. It would be something like this-I'll speak without meter; I'm not poetic: The priest came and prayed that the gods grant them the capture of Troy and their own safety, and that they accept compensation and free his daughter out of reverence for the god. When he bad said this, the others there showed pious respect and consented, but Agamemnon was angry and ordered him to leave immediately and not to come back again or else his scepter and the god's chaplets wouldn't protect him. Before his daughter would be freed, he said she'd grow old with him in Argos. He ordered him to go away and not provoke him if he wished to get home safely. The old man heard and was frightened; he went away in silence. But when he had withdrawn from the camp, he made a great prayer to Apollo, calling upon the god with his special names,41 reminding him and asking a return if anything he had ever given had been pleasing, whether it was in the building of temples or the sacrifice of victims. In return for them he called down the god's arrows on the Achaeans in payment for his tears. That, my comrade," I said, "is the way simple narrative without imitation comes to pass." "I understand," he said. "Now," I said, "understand that the opposite of this comes to pass when someone takes out the poet's connections
