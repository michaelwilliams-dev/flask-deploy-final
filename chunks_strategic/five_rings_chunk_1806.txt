Themethod ofutilizing one's own troops willbeeasy toseeifyoufollow theexample ofthefour figures mentioned above (Cesare Borgia, Gerone II,David, Charles VII) andifyou observe how Philip, father ofAlexander theGreat, andother Re- publicans andPrinces have armed anddefended themselves —on which rules Icompletely rely. WHAT ONE NEEDS TOKNOW INAPRINCIPALITY ABOUT THE MILITIA AthoughtthePrinceordersshouldnorandattendsdisciplineshavetonoanyotherofotherwar.objectiveskillsThisotheristhenorthanonlyanywarartother thatand concerns oneincommand. This isthevirtue thatmaintains those born torulebutalso makes thefortunes ofthose private leaders who risetorank. Vice-versa, those Princes who think more of gentle artsinstead ofarms losetheir states. Theprime reason why Princes losetheir states istheneglect oftheartofwar. Theprime reason how persons acquire states istheprofession ofthisart. Francesco Sforza, because hewasarmed, rose from private citizen tobetheDuke ofMilan. Hissons, discarding thehard- ships and being unarmed brought scorn upon themselves. A Prince cannot afford tobescorned. There isnomatch between an armed andadisarmed force. Itisn'treasonable foranarmed party tovoluntarily obey adisarmed party, orthatadisarmed party rest secure among armed forces. Heisatonce scorned andsuspect; so things cannot gowell. Hissoldiers cannot esteem aPrince who does notunderstand militias, besides other problems, norcanhe trust them. Hemust therefore never lose sight ofwarexercises, andin peace hehastostayarmed more than inwar. Hecandothisin twoways: one, operationally; two, mentally. Operationally, be- sides constantly maintaining anddisciplining thetroops, aPrince must always hunt. This hardens thebody tohardship butalso helps thePrince learn thenature ofthelandscape andplaces, the ways ofmountains, valleys, plains, andhegetstounderstand the rivers andswamps andtorespect them. This knowledge isuseful THE PRINCE —85 intwoways: hegetstoknow hisown country thebetter todefend it,butalso gets toknow terrain andwhat toexpect about other andnewplaces. Thelakes, valleys, plains, andrivers andswamps ofTuscany aresimilar tothose ofother places. What onelearns inoneprovince applies toanother. APrince who lacks thisskill lacks thefirstthing needing inaCaptain. Allthishelps infinding theenemy, pitching camp, leading thetroops, settling theorder of theday, andstaking sites toyour advantage. Pelopomene, Prince oftheAcheans, among virtues attributed tohim bywriters, was that ofthinking ofnothing butwar in times ofpeace. Often ifhewas inthecountry with friends he would stop them andsay;"Iftheenemy were onthathill,andwe were here with thearmy, who would have theadvantage? How would weadvance tomeet theenemy? Ifwewanted toretreat which way would wego?They would goover allthepossibili- ties,hear opinions, express their own, then testthem. Soitwasby continued practice thatthePrince, when leading thearmy, never lacked asolution inanycircumstance. Astomental preparation, aPrince must ever read history and examine therecords ofexcellent men, thereasons forvictory and defeat —tobetter achieve theoneandavoid theother. Heshould study some excellent man toimitate those who have been praised andglorified, borrowing hisgestures andactions, asAlexander theGreat imitated Achilles, Ceasar imitated Alexander, and Scipio imitated Cyrus. Whoever reads thelifeofCyrus written by Xenofantes (430-354 B.C.) realizes how much inlifeScipio owed toimitation —chastity, affability, humanity, andliberality. InallthisScipio followed what Xenofantes writes about Cyrus. Awise Prince will dolikewise. Hewill never belazy in peacetime butwillbeindustrious inpreparing tohave allready in times ofadversity sothat, when fortune changes, hecanmeet it andresist. CONCERNING MEN'S PRAISE, ITSCAUSES, ESPECIALLY FOR PRINCES, AND THEIR CONDEMNATION WePrinceersstillhaveneedwithwrittenhistoconsider themode ofgoverning ofa subjects andfriends. Iknow many oth- alotabout this, soIfearIwillbeheld presumptuous bydeparting from what others have saidabout the matter. Butsince myintent istowrite something useful tothe reader, Iplan togobehind appearances andposturing anddeal with theeffective reality ofthings. Many states have pretended to beRepublics orPrincipalities that were nothing ofthesort. There's abigdifference between how oneactually lives andhow oneshould ideally live.
