OBSERVANCE OF ‘THE LAW WuChan, born inAd). 625, was thedaughter ofaduke, and as a.beautiful youngwoman ofmany charms, she wasaccordingly attached totheharem ofEmperorT’a.iTsung. Theimperialharem was adangerous place, fullofyoungconcubines vyingtobecome theemperor’s favorite. Wu’s beautyand forceful charac- terquicklywon herthisbattle, but,knowing that anemperor,like other powerful men, isacreature ofwhim, andthat shecould easilybereplaced, shekepthereyeonthefuture. Wumanaged toseduce theemperor’sdissolute son, KaoTsung,onthe only possibleoccasion when shecould find him alone: while hewasreliev- inghimself attheroyal urinal. Even so,when theemperor died and Ken Tsung took over thethrone, shestillsuffered thefate towhich allwives and concubines ofadeceased emperorwere bound bytradition and law: Her head shaven, sheentered aconvent, forwhat wassupposedtobethe rest ofherlife. For sevenyears Wu schemed toescape. Bycommunicatingin secret with the newemperor, andbybefiiencling hiswife, theempress,she managedtogetahighly unusual royaledict allowingher toreturn tothe palace and totheroyal harem. Once there, shefawned onthe empress, while stillsleeping with the emperor.Theempress did notdiscourage this—--she hadyettoprovidetheemperor with anheir, herpositionwas vulnerable, and Wu was avaluable ally. In654 Wu Chao gave birth toachild. One daytheempresscame to visit, and assoon asshehad left, Wu smothered thenewborn——her own baby.When themurder wasdiscovered, suspicion immediatelyfell onthe empress, who had been onthe scene moments earlier, and whose jealous nature was known byall.This waspreciselyWu’s plan. Shortly thereafter, the empresswas charged with murder and executed. Wu Chao was crowned empressinherplace. Her new husband, addicted tohislifeof pleasure, gladly gave upthe reins ofgovernment toWuChao, who was from then onknown asEmpressWu. Althoughnow inaposition ofgreat power, Wuhardlyfelt secure. There were enemies everywhere; shecould notletdown herguardfor one moment. Indeed, when she wasforty-one,shebegan tofear that her bean~ tifulyoungniece wasbecomingtheemperor’sfavorite. Shepoisoned the woman with aclay mixed into herfood. In675her own son, touted asthe heirapparent,waspoisonedaswell. The next—eldest son———illegil:'ma.te, but now the crownprince——was exiled alittle later ontrumped—up charges. And when theemperor died, in683, Wumanagedtohave the son after that declared unfit forthethrone. Allflris meant that itwas heryoungest, most ineffectual sonwhofinally‘became emperor. Inthiswayshecontin- ued torule. Over thenext fiveyearsthere were innumerable palace coups. Allof them failed, and alloftheconspiratorswere executed. By688 there was no oneleft tochallenge Wu. Sheproclaimedherself adivine descendant of Buddha, and
