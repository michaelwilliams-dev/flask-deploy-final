Mata Hari went toofarwith herfabri- cations; althoughtheaccusation that she was aspywas false, atthetime it was areasonable presumptionbecause allher liesmade her seem suspi- cious and nefarious. Donotletyourairofmystery beslowly transformed into areputationfordeceit. The mystery youcreate must seem agame, playfulandunthreatening. Recognizewhen itgoes toofar,andpull back. There are times when the need forattention must bedeferred, and when scandal andnotorietyarethelastthings youwant tocreate. The at- tention you attract must never offend orchallengethereputationofthose above you—not,atany rate, iftheyare secure. You will seem notonly pal- trybutdesperate bycomparison.There isanarttoknowing when todraw notice and when towithdraw. Lola Montez was one ofthegreat practitioners ofthe artofattracting attention. Shemanaged torise from amiddle—class Irish backgroundto beingthelover ofFranz Liszt and then themistress andpoliticaladviser of King LudwigofBavaria. Inherlateryears, though, she lost her sense of proportion. InLondon in1850 there was tobe aperformance ofShakespeare’s Macbeth featuringthegreatestactor ofthetime, Charles johnKean.

Sotheaudience gotthere alittle early,and when thequeen entered herroyal box, theyobserved theconvention ofstanding upand applaudingher. Theroyal couple waited, then bowed. Everyonesatdown and thelightswere dimmed. Then, suddenly,alleyesturned toaboxop- posite QueenVictoria’s: Awoman appearedfrom theshadows, takingher seat later than thequeen.ItwasLola Montez. She wore adiamond tiara on herdark hair and along furcoat over her shoulders. People whisperedin amazement astheermine cloak wasdroppedtoreveal alow-neckedgown ofcrimson velvet. Byturningtheir heads, theaudience could seethat the royal couple deliberatelyavoided lookingatLola’s box. Theyfollowed Victoria’s example,and forthe rest oftheevening Lola Montez was ig- nored. After that eveningno one infashionable societydared tobe seen with her. Allhermagnetic powerswere reversed. People would flee her sight. Her future inEnglandwas finished. Neverappear overly greedyforattention, then, foritsignals insecurity, andinsecuritydrivespower away. Understand that there aretimes when it isnotinyourinterest tobethecenter ofattention. When inthepresenceof akingorqueen, forinstance, ortheequivalent thereof, bow and retreat to theshadows; nevercompete.
