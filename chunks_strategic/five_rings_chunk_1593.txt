Cardinal tleR212, 16]3-16 79 OBSERVANCE OFTHE LAW Sometime inthe 19205 theGerman writer Bertolt Brecht became aconvert tothe cause ofCommunism. From then onhisplays, essays,andpoemsre- flected hisrevolutionary fervor, and hegenerallytried tomake hisideolog- ical statements asclear aspossible.When Hitler came topowerin Germany,Brecht and hisCommunist colleaguesbecame marked men. He hadmanyfriends intheUnited States—Amerlcans who sympathized with hisbeliefs,aswell asfellow German intellectuals who had lied Hitler. In 1941, accordingly,Brecht emigratedtotheUnited States, and chose toset- tleinLosAngeles, where hehopedtomake alivinginthefilm business. Over thenext fewyearsBrecht wrotescreenplayswith apointedlyan— ticapitalistslant. Hehad little success inHollywood,soin1947, the war having ended, hedecided toreturn toEurope.That sameyear, however, theUS. Cong;ress’sHouse Un—American Activities Committee beganits investigationintosupposedCommunist infiltration inHollywood. Itbegan togather information onBrecht, who had soopenly espoused Marxism, and onSeptember 19,1947, onlyamonth before hehadplanned toleave theUnited States, hereceived asubpoenatoappearbefore thecommittee. Inaddition toBrecht, anumber ofother writers, producers, and directors were summoned toappearaswell, and thisgroupcame tobeknown asthe Hollywood19. Before goingtoWashington, theHollywood19met todecide onaplan ofaction. Their approach would beconfrontational. Instead ofanswering questions about their membership,orlack ofit,intheCommunist Party, they would read preparedstatements thatwould challengetheauthority of thecommittee andargue that itsactivities were unconstitutional. Even if thisstrategymeant imprisonment,itwould gainpublicityfortheir cause. Brecht disagreed.

Whynotout foxthecommittee byappearingtosurrender toitwhile subtly mocking it? TheHollywood19listened toBrecht politely,butdecided tostick totheir plan, leaving Brecht togohis ownway. The committee finallysummoned Brecht onOctober 30.Theyex- pectedhim todowhat othersamongtheHollywood19who had testified before him had done: Argue, refuse toanswer questions, challengethe committee's righttohold itshearing,even yellandhurl insults. Much to their surprise, however, Brecht was thevery picture ofCongeniality.He wore asuit(somethingherarely did), smoked acigar (hehad heard that thecommittee chairman was apassionate cigar smoker), answered their questions politely,andgenerallydeferred totheir authority. Unlike theother witnesses, Brecht answered thequestion ofwhether hebelongedtotheCommunistParty:He was not amember, hesaid, which happenedtobethetruth. One committee member asked him, “isit trueyouhave written anumber ofrevolutionary plays?” Brecht had writ- tenmany playswith overt Communistmessages,but heresponded, “I have written anumber ofpoemsand songsandplaysinthefight against Hitler and, ofcourse, theycan beconsidered, therefore, asrevolutionary because I,ofcourse, was fortheoverthrow ofthatgovernment.” This state ment went unchallenged. Brecht’s Englishwas more than adequate, butheused aninterpreter throughouthistestimony,atactic that allowed him toplaysubtlegames with language.When committee members found Communist leaningsin lines from Englisheditions ofhispoems,hewould repeatthelines inGer man fortheinterpreter,who would then retranslate them; and somehow theywouldcomeoutinnocuous. Atonepointacommittee member read oneofBrechfs revolutionary poemsoutloud inEnglish,and asked him if hehad written it.“No,” heresponded, “Iwrote aGermanpoem,which is verydifferent from this.” The author's elusive answers baffled thecommit- teemembers, buthispolitenessand thewayheyieldedtotheir authority made itimpossibleforthem togetangry with him. After onlyanhour ofquestioning,thecommittee members had had
