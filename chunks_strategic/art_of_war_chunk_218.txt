both the parallel and the contrast between martial and civil matters, as defined throughout its treatment of this theme. Here, at the end of �The Army,� the I Ching says, �The great leader has a command to start nations and receive social standing.� Originally cast in a feudal setting, this statement illustrates a principle more generally understood here and now in bureaucratic or corporate contexts, for bureaucracies and conglomerates are the heirs of feudalism, though they rendered and consumed their parents some time ago. Because many of the qualities needed for crisis management were also qualities needed for ordinary management, and because a complete education in China was believed to encompass both cultural and martial arts, a person might be both a military and a civilian leader, simultaneously or at different times. Zhuge Liange and Liu Ji are outstanding examples of individuals who were called upon to fulfill both military and civilian duties. The I Ching implies that warriors rejoin civilization when war is over, thus avoiding the pitfalls of a socially isolated warrior caste and also contributing the knowledge, character, and experience gained in war to the society for which the war was waged. According to the I Ching�s statement, the ideal government contributes to this reintegration by entitling warriors according to their achievements. Cheng Yi says, �The great leader rewards the successful with entitlement, making them overseers of groups, and gives them social distinction for their capability.� This is an example of the more general principle of meritocracy, a cornerstone of I Ching ideology written into the fundamentals of Confucian philosophy. The underlying implication in the case of �The Army� and its end is the corollary doctrine, embraced by strategists like Zhuge Liang, that military personnel, and especially military leaders, should have a good general education as well as special technical and military training. In Chinese this is called the combination of wen and wu. Wen, or culture, deals with the cultivation of constructive social skills and values. Wu, or the martial, deals with both practical and theoretical sciences of crisis management. According to Chinese military science in the I Ching�Taoist tradition as represented by The Art of War and certain later adepts, balance in wen and wu is believed to be better for warriors even on campaigns and in combat, as well as when they are eventually reinstated into civilian society. Therefore the I Ching�s statement concludes with the warning, �Petty people are not to be employed.� In this context, the statement means that when it comes to integrating warriors into society, achievement in war should not be viewed in isolation as the only criterion of advancement, in disregard of the moral integrity and total person of the individual concerned. Cheng Yi says, �As for petty people, even if they have achieved, they are not to be employed. There is more than one way to raise an army, go on an expedition, and achieve success; those who do so are not necessarily good people.� Zhuge Liang is
