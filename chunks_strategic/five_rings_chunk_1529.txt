Zelle clearly understood that what wasimportantinher act was notthedance it- self, oreven her face orfigure, butherabilitytocreate anairofmystery about herself. The mysteryshecreated laynotjustinherdancing,orher costumes, orthestories shewould tell, orherendless liesabout herorigins; itlayinanatmosphere enveloping everythingshedid. There wasnothing youcouldsayfor sure about her——she wasalways changing, alwayssur- prisingheraudience with new costumes, new dances, new stories. This air ofmysteryleftthepublic always wantingtoknow more, always wondering about her next move. Mata Hari was nomore beautiful thanmanyofthe otheryoung girls who came toParis, and she was not aparticularly good dancer. Whatseparatedherfrom the mass, what attracted and held the public’sattention and made her famous andwealthy,was hermystery. Peopleareenthralled bymystery;because itinvites constant interpreta- tion, theynever tireofit.The mysteriouscannot begrasped.And what cannot beseized and consumed creates power. LAW 6f51 52 LAW 6KEYS TOPOWER Inthepast,theworld was filled with theterrifyingand unknowable— diseases, disasters, capricious despots,themysteryofdeath itself. What we could not understand wereimaginedasmythsand spirits. Over the cen- turies, though,wehave managed, throughscience and reason, toillumi- nate thedarkness; what wasmysteriousandforbiddinghasgrownfamiliar and comfortable. Yetthislight has aprice:inaworld that isever more banal, that has had itsmysteryandmyth squeezedoutofit,wesecretly crave enigmas, peopleorthingsthat cannot beinstantly interpreted, seized, and consumed. That isthepower ofthemysterious:Itinvites layers ofinterpretation, excites ourimagination,seduces usintobelievingthat itconceals some- thingmarvelous. The world hasbecome sofamiliar and itsinhabitants so predictablethat whatwraps itself inmysterywill almost alwaysdraw the limelighttoitand make uswatch it. Donotimagine that tocreate anairofmystery youhave tobegrand andawe~inspirlng. Mysterythat iswoven intoyour day-to-day demeanor, and issubtle, hasthat much morepowertofascinate and attract attention. Remember: Most peopleareupfront,can beread like anopen book, take little care tocontrol their words orimage,and arehopelessly predictable. Bysimply holding back, keeping silent, occasionally uttering arnbiguous phrases, deliberately appearing inconsistent, andactingodd intliesubtlest ofways, youwill emanate anaura ofmystery.Thepeople around youwill then magnifythat aurabyconstantly dyingtointerpret you. Both artists and con artists understand thevital link between being mysteriousand attractinginterest. Count Victor Lustig,the aristocrat of swindlers, playedthegametoperfection.He wasalways doing thingsthat were different, orseemed tomake no sense. Hewould showupatthebest hotels inalimo driven byajapanese chauffeur; no one had ever seen a Japanese chauffeur before, sothis seemed exotic and strange. Lustig would dress inthemostexpensive clothing,butalwayswith something—a medal, aflower, anarrnband—out ofplace,atleast inconventional terms. This was seen not astasteless but asodd andintriguing.Inhotels hewould be seen receiving telegramsatallhours, one afier theother, broughttohimby hisJapanese chauffeur—telegramshewould tearupwith utter noncha- lance. (Infacttheywere fakes, completely blank.) Hewould sitalone inthe dining room, readingalargeandimpressive-looking book, smilingatpeo- pleyetremainingaloof. Vlfithin afewdays, ofcourse, the entire hotel would beabuzz with interest inthisstrangeman. All this attention allowed Lustigtolure suckers inwith ease. They would beg forhisconfidence and hiscompany. Everyonewanted tobe seen with thismysteriousaristocrat. And inthepresence ofthisdistracting enigma, they wouldn’t even notice thattheywere beingrobbed blind. Anairofmysterycan make themediocreappear intelligentandpro- found. Itmade Mata Hari, awoman ofaverage appearanceand intelli- gence,seem like agoddess,and herdancing divinely inspired. Anairof mystery about anartist makes hisorherartwork immediatelymore intrigu- ing,atrick Marcel Duchamp playedtogreat effect. Itisallvery easyto clo—-say little about your work, tease andtitillate withalluring,even contra~ dictory comments, then stand back andletothers trytomake sense ofitall. Mysterious people putothers inakind ofinferior position—-that oftry- ing tofigurethem out. Todegreesthattheycancontrol, theyalso elicit the fearsurrounding anythinguncertain orunknown. Allgreatleaders know that anaura ofmysterydraws attention tothem and creates anintimidating presence.Mao Tse-rung, forexample, cleverly cultivated anenigmatic image;hehad noworries about seeming inconsistent orcontradicting him~ self-—fl1e verycontradictoriness ofhisactions and words meant that hea.l~
