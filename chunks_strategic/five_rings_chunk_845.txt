battles with people is exhausting, costly, and unimaginative. Wise strategists prefer the art of maneuver: Before the battle even begins, they find ways to put their opponents in positions of such weakness that victory is easy and quick. Create dilemmas: Devise maneuvers that give them a choice of ways to respond-all of them bad. 21 NEGOTIATE WHILE ADVANCING: THE DIPLOMATIC-WAR STRATEGY Before and during negotiations, you must keep advancing, creating relentless pressure and compelling the other side to settle on your terms. The more you take, the more you can give back in meaningless concessions. Create a reputation for being tough and uncompromising, so that people are back on their heels before they even meet you. 22 KNOW HOW TO END THINGS: THE EXIT STRATEGY You are judged in this world by how well you bring things to an end.
