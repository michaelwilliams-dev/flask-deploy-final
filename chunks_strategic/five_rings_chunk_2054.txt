This statement isindicative ofthemost fundamental difference between Plato's political teaching and thatofthe Enlightenment. Forthemoderns, knowledge necessarily leads topolitical power. Stated otherwise, thedissemination ofknowledge gradually trans- forms civil society andinsures therealization ofdecent regimes. Plato de- nies thiscontention; knowledge asknowledge does not effect desirable political <;hange, andknowledge disseminated isnolonger knowledge. The philosopher must alsobeking.These aretwoseparate functions, andthis isthe coreofthepolitical problem. Knowledge cannot betransformed intouase power except intheperson ofthewiseman, although unwise power canbe made more powerful bytheuseofknowledge gained from thewise.
