OBSERVANCE OFTHE LAW I From earlyinhisreign,Ivan IV,later known asIvan theTerrible, had to confront anunpleasant reality:The country desperatelyneeded reform, buthelacked thepowertopushitthrough. The greatestlimit tohisauthor- ityCame from theboyars,the Russian princelyclass that dominated the countryand terrorized thepeasantry. In1553, attheageoftwenty-three,Ivan fellill.Lyinginbed, nearing death, heasked theboyars toswear allegiancetohis son asthe new czar. Some hesitated, some even refused. Then and there Ivan saw hehad no powerover theboyars.Herecovered from hisillness, buthenever forgot thelesson: Theboyarswere out todestroy him. And indeed intheyearsto come, manyofthe most powerfulofthem defected toRussia’s main ene- mies, Poland andLithuania, where theyplottedtheir return and the over- throw ofthe czar. Even one ofIvan’s closest friends, Prince Andrey Kurbski, suddenly turned against him, defectingtoLithuania in1564, and becomingthestrongest ofIva.n’s enemies. When Kurbski began raising troopsfor aninvasion, theroyal dynasty seemed suddenlymore precariousthan ever. With émigrénobles foment- inginvasion from thewest, Tartars bearing down from theeast, and thebcr yarsstirring uptrouble within thecountry,Russia’s vast size made ita nightmaretodefend. Inwhatever direction Ivan struck, hewould leave himself vulnerable ontheother side. Only ifhehad absolutepowercould hedeal with thismany-headed Hydra.And hehad nosuchpower. Ivan brooded until themorning ofDecember 3, 1564, when theciti- zens ofMoscow awoke toastrange sight.Hundreds ofsleds filled the squarebefore theKremlin, loaded with thecza.r’s treasures and withprovi- sions forthe entire court. Theywatched indisbelief asthe czar and his court boarded thesleds and left town. Without explaining why,heestab- lished himself inavillagesouth ofMoscow. For anentire month akind of terror grippedthecapital, fortheMuscovites feared that Ivan had aban- doned them tothebloodthirsty boyars. Shopsclosedupand riotous mobs gathered daily. Finally,onJanuary3of1565,a.letter arrived from the czar, explainingthat hecould nolonger bear theboyars’ betrayalsand had do cided toabdicate once and forall. Read aloud inpublic,theletter had astartling effect: Merchants and commoners blamed theboyarsforIvan’s decision, and took tothestreets, terrifyingthenobilitywith their fury. Soon agroupofdelegates represent- ingthechurch, theprinces,and thepeoplemade thejourneytoIvan’s vil- lage, andbeggedtheczar, inthe name oftheholyland ofRussia, toreturn tothethrone. Ivan listened butwould notchangehismind. After daysof hearingtheir pleas, however, heoffered hissubjectsachoice: Either they granthim absolutepowerstogovernashepleased,with nointerference from theboyars,ortheyfind anew leader. Faced with achoice between civil war and theacceptanceofdespotic power,almosteverysector ofRussian society “opted”for astrong czar, calling forIvan’s return toMoscow and therestoration oflawand order.
