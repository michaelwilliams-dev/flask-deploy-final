success without conflict was not always attainable, his strategy of hyperefficiency could at least minimize senseless violence and destruction. In Taoist terms, success is often gained by not doing, and the strategy of The Art of War is as much in knowing what not to do and when not to do it as it is in knowing what to do and when to do it. The art of not doing�which includes the unobtrusiveness, unknowability, and ungraspability at the core of esoteric Asian martial arts�belongs to the branch of Taoism known as the science of essence. The arts of doing�which include the external techniques of both cultural and martial arts�belong to the branch of Taoism known as the science of life. The science of essence has to do with state of mind, the science of life has to do with use of energy. Like a classic Taoist text, it is in true balance of these two that The Art of War is most completely understood. In more modern times, the definitive Taoist statement on this subject is immortalized in Journey to the West (Hsi-yu chi/Xiyou ji), one of the Four Extraordinary Books of the Ming dynasty (1368�1644). Drawing on earlier Taoist sources from wartime China under the duress of Mongol invasions, this remarkable novel is a classic representation of the result of what in Taoist terms would be called studying the science of life without the science of essence, material development without corresponding psychological development, or in Sun Tzu�s terms having force without intelligence. The central figure of this novel is a magical monkey who founds a monkey civilization and becomes its leader by establishing a territory for the monkeys. Subsequently the monkey king overcomes a �devil confusing the world,� and steals the devil�s sword. Returning to his own land with the devil�s sword, the monkey king takes up the practice of swordsmanship. He even teaches his monkey subjects to make toy weapons and regalia to play at war. Unfortunately, though ruler of a nation, the martial monkey king is not yet ruler of himself. In eminently logical backward reasoning, the monkey reflects that if neighboring nations note the monkeys� play, they might assume the monkeys were preparing for war. In that case, they might therefore take preemptive action against the monkeys, who would then be faced with real warfare armed only with toy weapons. Thus, the monkey king thoughtfully initiates the arms race, ordering pre- preemptive stockpiling of real weapons. If it seems disconcerting to read a thirteenth-century description of twentieth- century politics, it may be no less so to read a book as old as the Bible describing tactics in use today not only by guerrilla warriors but by influential politicians and corporate executives. Following the disillusionist posture of the Tao-te Ching and The Art of War, the story of the monkey king also prefigures a major movement in modern scientific thought following the climax of the Western divorce of religion and science centuries ago.
