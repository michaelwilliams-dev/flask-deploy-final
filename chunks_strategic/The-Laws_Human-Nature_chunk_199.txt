form of community. The Roman emperor Tiberius (42 BC�AD 37) is perhaps the most classic example of this type. As a child, his tutor noticed something wrong with the boy. �He is a pitcher molded with blood and bile,� the tutor once wrote to a friend. The writer Suetonius, who knew Tiberius, described him as follows: �He carried himself with his head held proudly high. . . . He was almost always silent, never saying a word except now and again. . . . And even then he did so with extreme reluctance, at the same time always making a disdainful gesture with his fingers.� Emperor Augustus, his stepfather, had to continually apologize to the Senate for �his displeasing manners, full of haughtiness.� Tiberius hated his mother�she never loved him enough. He never felt appreciated by Augustus, or his soldiers, or the Roman people.

Respect is something that must be earned through your achievements, not something given to you simply for being human. You must break out of the resentful cycle by becoming more generous toward people and human nature. In dealing with such types, you must exercise supreme caution. Although they might smile and seem pleasant, they are actually scrutinizing you for any possible insult. You can recognize them by their history of past battles and sudden breaks with people, as well as how easily they judge others. You might try to slowly gain their trust and lower their suspicions; but be aware that the longer you are around them, the more fuel you will give them for something to resent, and their response can be quite vicious. Better to avoid this type if possible. The Expansive (Positive) Attitude Some fifty years ago, many medical experts began to think of health in a new and revolutionary way.
