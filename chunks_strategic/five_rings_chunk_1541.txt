Wren, the consummate en- gineer, knew that these columns would serve nopurpose, and that the mayor’sfears were baseless. Butbuild them hedid, and themayorwas grateful. Itwasonly yearslater that workmen on ahighscaffold saw that thecolumns stopped justshort oftheceiling. Theywere dummies. Butboth men gotwhat they wanted: Themayor could relax, and Wren knew posteritywould understand that hisoriginal dedgn worked and thecolumns wereunnecessary.

Khrushchev inthemiddle ofa speech inwhich hewasdenouncing thecrimes ofStalin. “You were acol- league ofStalirfs,” the heekler yelled, “why didn’t you stop him then?” Khrushschev apparentlycould not seetheheckler and barked out, “VVho said that?” Nohand wentup.No one moved amuscle. After afew seconds oftense silence, Khrushchev finally said inaquiet voice, “Nowyouknow whyIdidn’t stophim.” Instead ofjustarguing that anyone facing Stalin wasafraid, knowing that theslightest signofrebellion would mean certain death, hehad made them feelwhat itwas like toface Stalin———had made them feel theparanoia, thefear ofspeaking up,theterror ofconfronting theleader, inthis case Khrushchev. The demonstration was visceral and no more argumentwasnecessary. The most powerful persuasion goes beyondaction intosymbol.
