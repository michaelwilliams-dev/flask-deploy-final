just man. There it was rendered as "innocence." Here Socrates uses it in its literal and etymologically precise sense. The word suffered the same alterations in sense in Greek as did the word ..innocent" in English. 10. Sons of Asclepius. Originally the term meant the family of Asclepius (the founder of medicine), for whom medicine was a family trade. It gradually began to be used for the priests of his cult, and generally all healers, who were his sons by adoption, as it were. 11. Iliad, XI, 624-641. It is not Eurypylus who is wounded and receives these attentions, but Machaon, a son of Asclepius and a doctor (cf. Ion, 538b where the passage is quoted and Machaon properly referred to). Patroclus is not even present at this scene. Machaon's wound is apparently not serious, and this draught is prepared for him and Nestor as refreshment. Eurypylus, wounded in the same engagement, asks for an entirely different treatment from Patroclus (XI, 828-836). (Cf. 408a, below, and note 59.) 12. The word for "prize" is practically the same as that for "old age" (geras and gents). 8. The Phocylides passage is only available in fragmentary form, but its sense may very well have been of this sort: "make a living first, then worry about virtue." Socrates makes this into an exhortation to virtue. 9. Politikon, a man who knows the business of the city. 10. Iliad, IV, 218--219. In this case it is Machaon alone who treats Menelaus. In the last half of the line Socrates drops a word found in Homer. Homer's text reads: "In his knowledge he sprinkled gentle salves on the wound." The half-line as Socrates renders it is to be found in the mouth of Eurypylus as he tells of the treatment he wants (XI, 830); this is the same Eurypylus whom Socrates substitutes for Machaon at 405e (cf. note 55). In these two citations, Socrates deliberately changes Homer's emphasis so as to minimize the attention necessary to the hodies of even heroes, as well as the amount of knowledge required for a true art of medicine. Abstraction from the needs of the body is the condition of the actualization of this best regime. Another such condition is a simplicity and isolation that make the deve1op? ment of the arts highly unlikely; Glaucon raises this question in the immediate sequel.

The word is dogma drawn from the word dqkein, "to seem," hence meaning "an opinion" but usually an authoritative opinio ; a decroo of the assembly, the opinion or consensus of the rulers of the people. The word here has both senses; it means "an opinion" and "a public agreement or law." 61. The word is gennaion which is, primarily, "noble" in the
