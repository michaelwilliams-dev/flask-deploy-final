go through (all such objections and spend a long time assuring ourselves they're not true, let's assume that this is so and go ahead, agreed that if it should : ever appear otherwise, all our conclusions based on it will be undone.� 437 a b C "That," he said, "is what must be done." "Then, would you set down all such things as opposites to one another," I said, "acceptance to refusal, longing to take something to rejecting it, embracing to thrusting away, whether they are actions or affections?" That won't make any difference." "Yes," he said, "they are opposites." "What about this?" I said. "Being thirsty and hungry and generally the desires, and further, willing and wanting-wouldn't you set all these somewhere in those classes26 we just mentioned? For example, won't you say that the soul of a man who desires either longs for what it desires or embraces that which it wants to become its own� or again, that, insofar as the soul wills that something be supplied t it, it nods assent to itself as though someone had posed a question and reaches out toward the fulfillment of what it wills?"

But, thirsting itself will never be a desire for anything other than that of which it naturally is a desire--for drink alone--and, similarly, hungering will be a desire for food?" "That's the way it is," he said. "Each particular desire itself is only for that particular thing itself of which it naturally is, while the desire for this or that kind depends on additions." "Now let no one catch us unprepared," I said, "and cause a disturbance, �alleging that no one desires drink, but good drink, nor food, but good food; for everyone, after all, desires good things; if, 438 then,
