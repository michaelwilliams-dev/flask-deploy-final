the Apology. The artisans are found insufficient, and the insufficiency of the arguments here shows why. These arguments are based on the premise that the arts like medicine are self-sufficient; but this is not so. The doctor can produce health, but that health is good he does not learn from medicine, and similarly with all of the arts. They deal with partial goods which presuppose a knowledge of the whole good to which they minister. The error of the discussion was to look for a specific subject matter for justice, to make it oneï¿½among many arts, to act as though only the doc? tor had anything to say about medicine. To help a sick friend one needs not only a doctor but someone who knows to whom health is fitting and how many other goods should be sacrificed to it, and who can direct the doctor to do what will most help the patient. There are master arts which rule whole groups of ministerial arts and are necessary to them. These are what Aristotle calls architectonic arts. The carpenter, the mason, the roofer, etc.-all are in need of an architect if a house is to be produced. He is more important than they are, he guides them, and he does not need to be a carpenter, a mason, or a roofer himself. Without the architect, all the other arts connected with building lack an end and are useless or worse. Similarly, justice must be a master art, ruling the arts which produce partial goods so as to serve the whole good. In other words, justice must be knowledge of that good which none of the other arts knows but which each presupposes. Lawgivers actually organize all the arts and tell their practitioners what they can and cannot do. What Socrates proposes is a legislative or political science. If each of the ar? tisans obeys the law established by a legislator who is wise in this science, he would be just, and justice would take care of itself in law? abiding practice of the arts. In this way the arts would provide what is fitting to each man. The very inadequacy of this argument, which divides the world among the arts without reflecting on that world which is divided, points to an art which does so; that art must be justice. Hence Socrates teaches [ 322] that in order to be just in the full sense one must be a philosopher and that philosophy is necessary to justice. Philosophy does have a subject matter which helps in doing good to friends and harm to enemies, for it alone knows what is good or fitting. And it alone is not neutral, for, by its very definition, it seeks the whole good. Justice in this way would be knowledge, would be useful, and would not be able indifferently to pro? duce opposite results. This is the solution which the argument compels us to seek. And a community of artisans ruled by philosophers would
