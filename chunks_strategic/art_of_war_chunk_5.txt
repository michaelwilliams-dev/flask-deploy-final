have a grudge against him. If Your Majesty has resolved to make a grand attack, you must win over T�ang and Ts�ai, and then you may succeed." Ho Lu followed this advice, [beat Ch�u in five pitched battles and marched into Ying.]5 This is the latest date at which anything is recorded of Sun Wu. He does not appear to have survived his patron, who died from the effects of a wound in 496. In another chapter there occurs this passage:6 From this time onward, a number of famous soldiers arose, one after the other: Kao-fan,7 who was employed by the Chin State; Wang-tzu,8 in the service of Ch�i; and Sun Wu, in the service of Wu. These men developed and threw light upon the principles of war. It is obvious enough that Ssu-ma Ch�ien at least had no doubt about the reality of Sun Wu as an historical personage; and with one exception, to be noticed presently, he is by far the most important authority on the period in question. It will not be necessary, therefore, to say much of such a work as the WU YUEH CH�UN CH�IU, which is supposed to have been written by Chao Yeh of the 1st century A.D. The attribution is somewhat doubtful; but even if it were otherwise, his account would be of little value, based as it is on the SHIH CHI and expanded with romantic details. The story of Sun Tzu will be found, for what it is worth, in chapter 2. The only new points in it worth noting are: (1) Sun Tzu was first recommended to Ho Lu by Wu Tzu-hsu. (2) He is called a native of Wu. (3) He had previously lived a retired life, and his contemporaries were unaware of his ability. The following passage occurs in the Huai-nan Tzu: "When sovereign and ministers show perversity of mind, it is impossible even for a Sun Tzu to encounter the foe." 4The appellation of Nang Wa. 5SHI CHI, ch. 31. 6SHI CHI, ch. 25. 7The appellation of Hu Yen, mentioned in ch. 39 under the year 637. 8Wang-tzu Ch�eng-fu, ch. 32, year 607. CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 8 Assuming that this work is genuine (and hitherto no doubt has been cast upon it), we have here the earliest direct reference for Sun Tzu, for Huai-nan Tzu died in 122 B.C., many years before the SHIH CHI was given to the world. Liu Hsiang (80-9 B.C.) says: "The reason why Sun Tzu at the head of 30,000 men beat Ch�u with 200,000 is that the latter were undisciplined." Teng Ming-shih informs us that the surname "Sun" was bestowed on Sun Wu�s grandfather by Duke Ching of Ch�i [547-490 B.C.]. Sun Wu�s father Sun P�ing, rose to be a Minister of State in Ch�i, and Sun Wu himself, whose style was Ch�ang-ch�ing, fled to Wu on account of the rebellion which was being fomented by the kindred of T�ien Pao. He had three sons, of whom the second, named
