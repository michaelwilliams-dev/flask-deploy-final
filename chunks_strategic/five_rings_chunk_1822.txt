Above all,heformulated thenew prestige ofthe“State.” Hedealt even inrevolution —and, again, stressed thatvirtue wasa force greater than good andevil. Inonesense, ThePrince supersedes Plato's Republic —thefirst tract ofpolitical science inantiquity that posed theproblem ofwhat theState should be.Inanswer tothis, Mac- chiavelli wrote ofbasing theState onwhat is—notonwhat should be. Machiavelli served Florence asaministerial secretary andinother roles, being briefly imprisoned andtortured in1513. Heexecuted vari- ousdiplomatic missions tothePapacy, France, andtoother states inIt- aly.Hemarried in1501 toMarietta diLuigi Corsini andhadsixchil- dren, although hewasnotagreat family man.

Machiavelli ended upbeing distrusted andsuspect toawide spec- trum ofpolitical andreligious forces andwas excluded from office when intheyear ofhisdeath, 1527, hereturned toFlorence under the new republican constitution.
