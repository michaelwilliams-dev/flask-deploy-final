young man in any other way, they contrive to implant some love in him-a great winged drone-to be the leader of the idle desires that in? sist on all available resources being distributed to them. Or do you sup? pose that love in such men is anything other than a winged drone?" "I suppose," he said, "that it is nothing but this." "Then, when the other desires-overflowing with incense, myrrh, crowns, wines and all the pleasures_ with which such societies are rife-buzz around the drone, making it grow great and fostering it, they plant the sting of longing in it. Now this leader of the soul takes madness for its armed guard and is stung to frenzy. And if it finds in the man any opinions or desires accounted good and still admitting of shame, it slays them and pushes them out of him until it purges him of moderation and fills him with madness brought in from abroad.'' "Your account," he said, "of a tyrannic man's genesis �is quite perfect." "Is it for this reason, too," I said, "that love has from old been called a tyrant?" "That's likely," he said.

"Necessarily," he said. "Don't many terrible and very needy desires sprout up beside it every day and night?" "They are indeed many." "So that whatever revenues there may be are quickly used up." "Of course." "And next surely come borrowing and the stripping away of his estate." "What else?" "Then when all this gives out, won't the crowd of intense desires hatched in the nest necessarily cry out; and won't these men, driven as it were by the stings of the other desires but especial1y by love itse]f, which guides a1l the others as though they were its armed guards, rage and consider who has anything they can� take away by deceit or force?"
