In1864 thecomposer Richard Wagner moved toMunich atthebehest ofLudwig 11,known variouslyasthe Swan KingortheMad King of Bavaria. Ludwig wasWagner‘s biggestfanand most generous patron.The strength ofhissupport turned Wagner’s head»-<mce established inMunich under theking's protection, hewould beable tosayand dowhatever he wanted. Wagner moved into alavish house, which theking eventually bought forhim. This house wasbut astone’s throw from theformer home ofLola Montez, thenotorious courtesan who hadplunged Ludwig II’sgrandfather into acrisis that had forced him toabclicate. Warned that hecould bein- fected bythisassociation, Wagner onlyscoffed-——-“I am noLola Montez," hesaid. Soon enough, however, thecitizens ofMunich began toresent the favors andmoneyshowered onWagner,and dubbed him “the second Lola,” or“Lolotte.” Heunconsciously begantotread inLo1a’s footsteps- spending money extravagantly, meddling inmatters beyond music, even dabblinginpoliticsandadvisingthekingoncabinet appointments.Mean- while Ludwigsaffection forWagner seemed intense andundignifiedfor a l-:ing——just likehisgrandfather’slove forLola Montez. Eventually Ludwig’s ministers wrote him aletter: “Your Majestynow stands atafateful partingoftheways: you have tochoose between thelove andrespect ofyourfaithfulpeopleand the‘friendship’ ofRichard Wag- ner.” InDecember of1865, Ludwig politelyasked hisfriend toleave and never return. Wagner hadinadvertently placedhimself inLola Montez’s reflection. Once there, everythinghedidreminded thestolicl Bavariams of that dread woman, and there wasnothinghecould doabout it. Avoid such association-effects like theplague.Inamirrored situation youhave little ornocontrol over thereflections and recollections that will beconnected toyou,andanysituation beyond yourcontrol isdangerous.
