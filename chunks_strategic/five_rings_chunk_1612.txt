IntheyearI500 he managed totake Romagna, innorthern Italy. The regionhad foryears been ruled byaseries ofgreedymasters who hadplundereditswealth for themselves. Without policeoranydisciplining force, ithad descended into lawlessness, whole areas being ruled byrobbers andfeudingfamilies. Toestablish order, Cesare appointedalieutenant general oftheregion-— RemixrodeOreo, “acruel and vigorous man,” accordingtoNiccolo Machiavelli. CesaregavetheOrco absolute powers. With energy andviolence, deOrco established asevere, brutal justice inRornagna,and soon riditofalmost allofitslawless elements. But inhis zeal hesometimes went toofar,and after acouple ofyearsthelocalpopu- lation resented and even hated him. InDecember of1502, Cesare took dc» cisive action. Hefirst letitbeknown that hehad notapprovedofdeOrco’s cruel and violent deeds, which stemmed from thelieutenanfs brutal na- ture. Then, onDecember 22,heimprisonedcleDrco inthe town ofCe- sena, and thedayafter Christmas thetownspeople awoke tofind astrange spectacleinthemiddle ofthepiazza:doOrco’s headless body,dressed ina lavish suitwith apurple cape,thehead impaled beside iton apike,the bloodyknife and executioner’s block laid outbeside thehead. AsMachi- avelli concluded hiscomments ontheaffair, “The ferocity ofthis scene left thepeopleatonce stunned and satisfied.” Interpretation Cesare Borgiawas amaster playerinthegame ofpower. Always planning several moves ahead, hesethisopponentsthecleverest traps.For this Machiavelli honored him above allothers inThePrince. Cesare foresaw thefuture with amazing clarityinRomagna‘. Onlybru- taljusticewould bring order totheregion. The processwould take several years, and atfirst thepeoplewould welcome it.But itwould soon make many enemies, and the citizens would come toresent theimposition of such unforgiving justice, especially byoutsiders. Cesare himself, then, could notbe seen astheagent ofthisjustice-—the people’shatred would cause toomany problemsinthefuture. And sohechose the one man who could dothedirty work, knowing inadvance that once thetask was done hewould have todisplaydeOrco’s head on apike.The scapegoatinthis case had been plannedfrom thebeginning. With Ts’ao Ts’ao, thescapegoatwas anentirelyinnocent man; inthe Romagna,hewas theoffensiveweaponinCesare’s arsenal that lethim get thedirtywork done without bloodyinghis own hands. With this second kind ofscapegoatitiswise toseparate yourselffrom thehatchet man at some point, either leaving himdanglinginthewind or,like Cesare, even making yourselfthe one tobring him
