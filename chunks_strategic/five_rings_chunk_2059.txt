Thelanguage here hasareligous solemnity. The firstdays ofthis festival were devoted topurifications, and then therewasaspectacular torchlight procession leading thegodlacchus (Dionysus) fromAthens back toEleusis where theinitiations took place. This calls tomind theall-but-forgotten torch racepromised at328a. 22.This description should becompared with Pericles' fiineral oration (Thucydides, II,xxvii-xli). 23.Cf.Xenophon, TheAthenian Republic, 1,8-12. 24.Wedonotpossess theplayfromwhich thisquote comes, nordowe know anything ofitscontext.

Thiswould beanappropriate context forSocrates tousean utterance withsuch overtones (cf.Aristotle, Ethics, 1111a, 9fif.). 25.Theproverb was"like mistress, likedog," with theambiguity that dogwastaken inthesense ofservant. Socrates takes itliterally. 26.Lycaon, anancient hero, founded asanctuary ontheLycaean moun- tains inArcadia. Among theofferings hesacrificed there wasachild.

The line isparadoxically called a"plane" because itslength isanumber (9) formed oftwoelements (3x3),which could represent length andwidth. Square numbers were technically called "plane numbers." Then the"plane line" issquared andcubed andresults inasolid, thenumber ofwhich is729. Why Socrates chooses thevalues hedoes, orwhyheusesmultiplication rather than addition, orwhyasolidmustbeproduced areallunclear, unless hewish- estomake theresult aslarge aspossible inthisprototypical attempt tomath- ematize human things. 11.Philolaus, thepre-Socratic philosopher ofthePythagorean school, calculated thattherewere 36454 days intheyear. Ifthere areasimilar num- berofnights, thenumber would be729.Healsoheld thatthere isagreat year of729months. Itisprobably thistowhich Socrates refers. Inwhatwaythe number 729would express years isunknown. 12.TheChimaera wasalioninfront, adragon behind, andashe-goat
