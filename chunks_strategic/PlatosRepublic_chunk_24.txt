this that harm is owed to enemies by the just man and help to friends-the man who said it was not wise. For he wasn't telling the truth. For it has become apparent to us that it is never just to harm anyone." ''I agree," he said. "We shall do battle then as partners, you and I," I said, "if someone asserts that Simonides, or Bias, or Pittacus28 or any other wise and blessed man said it." "I, for one," he said, "am ready to be your partner in the battle." "Do you know," I said, "to whom, in my opinion, that saying belongs which asserts that it is just to help friends and harm ene? mies?" "To whom?" he said. "I suppose it belongs to Periander, or Perdiccas, or Xerxes, or Ismenias the Theban,29 or so e other rich man who has a high opinion of what he can do." "What you say is very true," he said.

I was astounded when I heard him, and; looking at him, I was frightened. I think that if I had not seen him before he saw me, I would have been speechless.30 As it was, just when he began to be ex? asperated by the argument, I had looked at him first, so that I was able to answer him; and with just a trace of a tremor, I said: "Thrasyma? chus, don't be hard on us. lf we are making any mistake in the con? sideration of the arguments, Polemarchus and I, know well that we're making an unwilling mistake.
