justice is useless in the enterprise of doing good to friends and harm to enemies. What has happened is that Socrates and Polemarchus discover that the world is divided up among the arts and there is nothing left for an art of justice. A doctor may do good to his friends and hence be just, but justice is nothing beyond the exercise of his art, which is something other than justice. Arts are the means of doing good and harm; arts have subject matters but justice does not; hence justice is not an art and cannot do good. Justice has disappeared. Moreover, Socrates insists on pointing out that the arts are neutral, that they can effect opposite results with equal ease. This fact is particularly shocking to Polemarchus, for its consequence is that the practitioner of the art of justice would be as adept at stealing as at guarding a thing and would lie as well as he tells the truth. Nothing in the art would guide a man as to which he should do; he would merely be technically proficient. Instead of being the model of reliability, the just man becomes the archetype of untrustworthiness, the possessor of power without guiding principle. He is a thief and a liar, the contrary of the debt-paying, truth-telling just man defined by Polemarchus' father -a definition which Polemarchus has inherited and the substance of which he is trying to defend. Of course, it has been admitted that the just man sometimes would not pay his debts and would lie even to his friends, so the result of this argument should not be surprising. But' Polemarchus is un? willing to accept it. He is a gentleman, and there are certain things? dishonorable things-a gentleman js never supposed to do. He may admit that they must be done, and even do them, but he refuses to rec? ognize the consequences of what he does. If he did so, it would seem to end in the loss of all standards. Life is ordered according to fixed rules, and the exceptions are hidden in silence. Polemarchus could be accused of hypocrisy, and the limitations of his kind of moralism are exposed here. Socrates hints that the good things which Polemarchus defends might well have been acquired in less than decent ways, the memory of which is lost in the mists of tiine.ï¿½ But, even worse, his character is such that he would probably rather work harm than use ungentlemanly means to a good end. Socrates, as the Republic reveals, is not averse to lies and is certainly no respecter of private property. However that may be, the assumption that justice is an art does lead to serious difficulties, expressed ironically in the notion that the just man is both useless and a thief. It would seem that arts require par? ticular subject matters and that they are morally neutral. We are forced to abandon the assumption, and one might very well ask why it was made
