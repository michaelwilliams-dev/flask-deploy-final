had prayed and looked on, we went off toward town. Catching sight of us from afar as we were pressing homewards, Polemarchus, son of Cephalus, ordered his slave boy to run after us and order us to wait for him. The boy took ho)d of my cloak from behind and said, "Polemarchus orders you to wait." And I turned around and asked him where his master was. "He is coming up behind," he said, "just wait." "Of course we'll wait," said Glaucon. A moment later Polemarchus came along with Adeimantus, Glau? con's brother, Niceratus, son of Nicias, and some others-apparently from the procession. Polemarchus said, "Socrates, I guess you two are hurrying to get away to town." "That's not a bad guess," I said. "Well," he said, "do you see how many of us there are?" "Of course." "Well, then," he said, "either prove stronger than these men 9r stay here." �� SOCRATES/POLEMARCHUS/GLAUCON/ ADEIMANTUS / CEPHALUS THE REPUBLIC 327C 328a b C d e "Isn't there still one other possibility . . . ," I said, "our per- suading you that you must let us go?" "Could you really persuade," he said, "if we don't listen?" "There's no way," said Glaucon. "Well, then, think it over, bearing in mind we won't listen." Then Adeimantus said, "Is it possible you don't know that at sun- set there will be a torch race on horseback for the goddess?" "On horseback?" I said. "That is novel. Will they hold torches and pass them to one another while racing the horses, or what do you mean?" "That's it," said Polemarchus, "and, besides, they'll put on an all? night festival that will be worth seeing.We'll get up after dinner and go to see it; there we'll be together with many of the young men and we'll talk. So stay and do as I tell you." And Glaucon said, "It seems we must stay." "Well, if it is so resolved,"6 I said, "that's how we must act." Then we went to Polemarchus' home; there we found Lysias7 and Euthydemus, Polemarchus' brothers, and, in addition, Thrasymachus,8 the Chalcedonian and Charmantides, the Paeanian,9 and Cleito? phon,10 the son of Aristonymus. Cephalus,11 Polemarchus' father, was also at home; and he seemed very old to me, for I had not seen him for some time. He was seated on a sort of cushioned stool and was crowned with a wreath, for he had just performed a sacrifice in the courtyard. We sat down beside him, for some stools were arranged in a circle there. As soon as Ceph? alus saw me, he greeted me warmly and said: "Socrates, you don't come down to us in the Piraeus very often, yet you ought to. Now if I still had the strength to make the trip to town easily, there would be no need for you to come here; rather we would come to you. As it is, however, you must come here more fre? quently. I want you to know that
