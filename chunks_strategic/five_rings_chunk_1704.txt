Once under hiswing, Michelangeloand Leonardo requitedhisgenerosity bybe» coming loyalartists inhisstable. Whenever Lorenzo faned anenemy,hewould wield theweapon of patronage.When Pisa, Florence’s traditionalenemy,threatened torebel againstitin1472, Lorenzo placateditspeople bypouring moneyinto its university,which had once been itspride andjoybuthadlong ago lost its luster.
