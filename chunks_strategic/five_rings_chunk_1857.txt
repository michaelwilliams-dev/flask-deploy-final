"Inthat case," hesaid, "the toolswould beworth alot." "Then," Isaid, "totheextent thatthework oftheguardians is more important, itwould require more leisure timethan theother tasks aswell asgreater artanddiligence." "Icertainly think so,"hesaid. "And also anature fitforthepursuit?" "Ofcourse." "Then it'sourjob, asitseems, tochoose, ifwe're able,which are thenatures, andwhat kind they are, fitforguarding thecity." "Indeed itisourjob." "ByZeus," Isaid, "it'snomean thing we've taken upon our- [51 ] socrates/glaucon therepublic 374e selves. Butnevertheless, wemustn't becowardly, atleast asfarasit'sin ourpower." 375a "No," hesaid,"wemustn't." "Doyousuppose," Isaid, "that forguarding there isany dif- ference between thenature ofanoble puppy andthatofawell-bom young man?" "What doyoumean?" "Well, surely both ofthemneed sharp senses, speed tocatchwhat theyperceive, and, finally, strength iftheyhave tofight itoutwithwhat theyhave caught." "Yes, indeed," hesaid,"both need allthese things." "Tosaynothing ofcourage, ifthey aretofight well." "Ofcourse." "Then, willhorse ordog— oranyother animal whatsoever —be willing tobecourageous ifit'snotspirited? Haven't younoticed how b irresistible andunbeatable spirit^^ is,sothat itspresence makes every soul fearless andinvincible inthefaceofeverything?" "Yes, Ihave noticed it." "As forthebody's characteristics, it'splainhow theguardian must be." "Yes." "And asforthesoul's— thathemustbespirited." "That too." "Glaucon," Isaid, "with such natures, how will they notbe savage tooneanother andtherestofthecitizens?" "ByZeus," hesaid, "itwon't beeasy." c "Yet, theymustbegentle totheirownandcruel toenemies. If not, they'll notwait forothers todestroy them, butthey'll do itthem- selves beforehand." "True," hesaid. "What willwedo?" Isaid."Where willwefind adisposition at thesame time gentle andgreat-spirited? Surely agentle nature isop- posed toaspirited one." "Itlooks like it." "Yet, ifaman lacks either ofthem, hecan'tbecome agood guardian. Butthese conditions resemble impossibilities, andsoitfol- d lows thatagood guardian isimpossible." "I'm afraid so,"hesaid. Itoowasataloss,and,looking backoverwhathadgone before, I said, "It isjust,myfriend, thatwe're ataloss.Forwe've abandoned theimageweproposed." "How doyoumean?" "We didn't notice thatthere are, after all,natures such aswe [52 ] Book JI/374e-376c socorates/glaucon thought impossible, possessing these opposites." 375d "Where, then?" "One could see itinother animals too,especially, however, inthe onewecompared totheguardian. Youknow, ofcourse, thatbynature e thedisposition ofnoble dogs istobeasgentle ascanbewith their familiars andpeople theyknow andtheopposite with those they don't know." "Idoknow that." "Then," Isaid, "itispossible, after all;andwhat we're seeking for intheguardian isn't against nature." "Itdoesn't seem so." "Inyour opinion, then, does themanwho willbeafitguardian need, inaddition tospiritedness, also tobeaphilosopher inhis nature?"** "How's that?" hesaid. "Idon't understand." 376a "This, too, you'll observe indogs," Isaid,"and it'sathing inthe beast worthy ofourwonder." "What?" "When itseessomeone itdoesn't know, it'sangry, although it never hadanybadexperience withhim.Andwhen itseessomeone it knows, itgreets himwarmly, even ifitnever hadagood experience withhim.Didn't youeverwonder about thisbefore?" "No, Ihaven't paidverymuch attention toituptonow.But it's plain that itreally does this." "Well, thisdoes look likeanattractive affection ofitsnature and truly philosophic." b "Inwhatway?" "Inthat itdistinguishes friendly from hostile looks bynothing other thanbyhaving learned theoneandbeing ignorant oftheother," I said."And so,howcan itbeanything other than alover oflearning since itdefines what's itsownandwhat's alienbyknowledge and ignorance?" "Itsurely couldn't beanything but,"hesaid. "Well," Isaid, "but aren't loveoflearning andlove ofwisdom the same?" "Yes, thesame," hesaid. "Soshallwebeboldand assert that ahuman being too, ifheis going tobegentle tohisownandthoseknown tohim,mustbynature c beaphilosopher andalover oflearning?" "Yes," hesaid, "let's assert it." "Then themanwho's going tobeafineandgood^s guardian of thecity foruswill inhisnature bephilosophic, spirited, swift, and strong." [53
