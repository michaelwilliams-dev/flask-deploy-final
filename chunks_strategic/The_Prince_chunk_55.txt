were friends of the Ro.to of mans, ask them to stay out it. The Romans urged them to side with them. The Achaeans deliberated in council where the legate of Antioch persuaded them to neutrality. The Roman leg.ate responded; "The plea for stay neutral could not be you to more against your interest. You will be without dignity and with.out thanks the spoil of the victor." It always happens that someone who is not your friend will urge you to neutrality. Your friend will ask you to take arms with him. Irresolute Princes almost always follow the path of neutral.ity to escape pressing dangers. And almost always, they ruin themselves. But a Prince, who bravely declares himself in favor of as one party, if that party wins, as long you stay strong and the remain on his side, will find winner obliging and friendly. Men are not so dishonest that they oppress you in such an easy way with ingratitude. Their victories are seldom so clear that they don�t have some respect for justice. If your side loses, your ally will still receive you. He may help you if he can and your for.tunes may rise again. In the case when the parties are such that you need not fear who wins, still prudence says you should stick your neck out. You help ruin someone with the help of someone else who, if they were wise, should have helped them. Winning, they remain subject to you. Their victory would have been im.possible without you. Here it should be noted a Prince should never take sides with a more powerful party when it offends oth THE PRINCE � 117 ers, except out of absolute necessity. In victory, you will become subject to them. Princes should avoid as much as possible obliga.tions to others. The Venetians sided with France against the Duke of Milan when they could have avoided that alliance. It ruined them. When it is impossible to escape the alliance, as it was for the Florentines when the Pope and Spain combined to wage war on Lombardy, the Prince should declare himself as outlined above. Nor should he ever believe that he is taking sides in a sure thing � he should always be skeptical. This is the natural state of things. One never can sidestep an uncertainty without stepping of into another one. Prudence consists in weighing the qualities the uncertainty, and choosing the best of alternatives. A Prince should show love of virtue, and recognize virtuous men and honor those skilled in any art. He must encourage the to in citizens quietly exercise their various disciplines, trade or agriculture, and in every other human occupation. He must act so that this one will not fear improving property because it might be taken from him, that one fears not open trade because of or to taxes. He needs to create medals and awards for those who under.take these things. He needs to reward all those who aggrandize his city
