always equally predominant; [That is, as Wang Hsi says: "they predominate alternately."] the four seasons make way for each other in turn. [Literally, "have no invariable seat."] There are short days and long; the moon has its periods of waning and waxing. [Cf. V. ss. 6. The purport of the passage is simply to illustrate the want of fixity in war by the changes constantly taking place in Nature. The comparison is not very happy, however, because the regularity of the phe- nomena which Sun Tzu mentions is by no means paralleled in war.] Chapter 8 MANEUVERING 1. Sun Tzu said: In war, the general receives his commands from the sover- eign. 2. Having collected an army and concentrated his forces, he must blend and harmonize the different elements thereof before pitching his camp. ["Chang Yu says: "the establishment of harmony and confidence between the higher and lower ranks before venturing into the field;" and he quotes a saying of Wu Tzu (chap. 1 ad init.): "Without harmony in the State, no military expedition can be undertaken; without harmony in the army, no battle array can be formed." In an historical romance Sun Tzu is represen- ted as saying to Wu Yuan: "As a general rule, those who are waging war should get rid of all the domestic troubles before proceeding to attack the external foe."] 3. After that, comes tactical maneuvering, than which there is nothing more difficult. [I have departed slightly from the traditional interpretation of Ts�ao Kung, who says: "From the time of receiving the sovereign�s instructions until our encampment over against the enemy, the tactics to be pursued are most difficult." It seems to me that the tactics or maneuvers can hardly be said to begin until the army has sallied forth and encamped, and Ch�ien Hao�s note gives color to this view: "For levying, concentrating, harmonizing and entrenching an army, there are plenty of old rules which will serve. The real difficulty comes when we engage in tactical operations." Tu Yu also observes that "the great difficulty is to be beforehand with the enemy in seizing favorable position."] The difficulty of tactical maneuvering consists in turning the devious into the direct, and misfortune into gain. 60 CHAPTER 8. MANEUVERING 61 [This sentence contains one of those highly condensed and somewhat en- igmatical expressions of which Sun Tzu is so fond. This is how it is ex- plained by Ts�ao Kung: "Make it appear that you are a long way off, then cover the distance rapidly and arrive on the scene before your opponent." Tu Mu says: "Hoodwink the enemy, so that he may be remiss and leisurely while you are dashing along with utmost speed." Ho Shih gives a slightly different turn: "Although you may have difficult ground to traverse and natural obstacles to encounter this is a drawback which can be turned into actual advantage by celerity of movement." Signal examples of this saying are afforded by the two famous passages across the Alps�that
