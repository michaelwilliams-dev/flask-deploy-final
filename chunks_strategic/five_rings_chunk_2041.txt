self-contradictory and ishence either comic or tragic. Butthepoets donotshow, andperhaps donotbelieve in,the possibility ofanoncontradictory lifelivedbyamanwho isneither comic nortragic. They water man's laughter andhispitywithout giving him acounterpoise; hence they justify laughter andpity asultimate responses tothehuman situation. Pity, inparticular, isapassion con- nected with one'sownpossible sufferings; itseesthelosses suffered by even thenoblest ofmenandrecognizes howthreatened arethethings forwhich aman lives. Pity,grown great, ends interror caused bythe misery ofman's existence. Themanoverwhelmed bypityandfear is thernan least ofallable toforget himself andhisown,andhence the things that willprotect himandgive hislifemeaning. Most ofall,he looks tothelawsandthegods, and hispitycanwellmake him a fanatic. Thenatural passions ofmenwhich Homer knows andappeals [433 ] THEREPUBLIC toarethose thatmost attach aman toconvention andhence tobondage inthecave.AndtheHomeric gods aresuch astoencourage and satisfy thepitying partofman's soul. Socrates admits theoverwhelming charm ofpoetry, acharm com- posed ofelements drawn ontheonehand, from theattachment toone's particular existence andwhat isconnected with it,and,ontheother hand, from thepleasure which accompanies thecontemplation ofthe truth. Butthetruthwhich poetry reveals isonly apartial truth, and, in liberating from theconventions orlawsofacity, itcancontribute toan enslavement tothesource ofconvention, theloveofone'sown.Reason istheonlyinstrument withwhich tofight laughter andpity.Butpoetry belongs essentially tothefaculty ofimagination, afaculty necessary to reasoning, one,however, which canalsobeatwarwith it.Theover- coming oftheattachment toone'sown isamonstrous endeavor, and thepassions served bypoetry rebel against it;butthatendeavor is necessary tophilosophy. This, then, istheessence ofthequarrel between philosophy and poetry. Socrates banishes poetry once more, butthistime offers ita return ifitcanlearn toargue, tojustify itself before thebarofphiloso- phy.Hepoints theWay toAristotle's understanding oftragedy asa purgation ofthepassions ofpityandfearrather than their satisfaction. Suchtragedy would prepare aman tobereasonable andmoderate after having purged those terrible passions; itwould paydueattention to man's necessary loveofhisown, butwould temper itinsuch away as toallow himsome freedom from it.Thus tragedy would neither give waytothese passions nordeny their existence. Itwould thenbeanim- portant part oftheeducation ofdecent, unfanatic men. Poetry will return, butonly afterhaving learned tosubordinate itself, tomitigate itsunguided tendencies toward indulgence andfanaticism. When the poets depict thegodstheymustnolonger look tolaughter andpitybut totheideas. (608c-621d) The discussion ofpoetry isapreparation fora discussion oftherewards andpunishments ofjustice and injustice. Poetry will tell,asitalways has,thetales ofthewages ofvirtue inthis lifeandthenext.Thetheme appears tobemore appropriate topoetic than philosophic treatment, both interms ofthethings discussed and theaudience towhich itisrelevant. Socrates, inundertaking this discussion, disobeys Glaucon's explicit command, forthelatterhad in- sisted thatatruepraise ofjustice initselfwould have toabstract from anyrewards extrinsic tojustice ^vhich might accrue toit.Socrates thus returns totheconventional wayofpraising justice which Adeimantus hascriticized. Glaucon andAdeimantus permit Socrates todosobe- [434 ] Interpretive Essay cause they arenowmore favorably disposed tojustice; Socrates must dosobecause thedialogue hasnot sufficiently demonstrated that citizen virtue ischoiceworthy foritself, andGlaucon andAdeimantus arenotcapable ofphilosophic virtue. The firststepofthepraise istoextend therange ofconsideration beyond this lifetoeternity because eternity istheproper study ofman, andbecause thepromiscuity offortune inthis lifewould tend tomake menbelieve thatjustice goesunrewarded andinjustice unpunished. So Socrates undertakes toconvince Glaucon that thesoul isimmortal. This discussion canhardly rank asaproof, andthere isnoattempt at alltoshow thattheindividual soul isimmortal, which istheonlything amananxious about hisfateafter lifewould careabout. Moreover, Soc- rates admits thatweknow nothing about thesoul,which denies the value oftheargument, calling intoquestion theteaching ofthewhole dialogue which wasbased onanunderstanding ofthesoul.This discus- sionthen serves twopurposes: tocause theunphilosophic man tobe concerned about justice forfearofwhat willhappen tohim inanother world, andtoturnphilosophic men tothestudy ofthesoul.Thesoul is thephilosophic question, and itishisconcern forthisquestion that distinguishes Socrates from hispredecessors; themost characteristic partofhisteaching isthatsoul
