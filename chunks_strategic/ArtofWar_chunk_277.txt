river and surrounded the citadel of the traitor, but then they left that city and headed for the heartland of the region. The Wei commanders said, �Surrounding the citadel without laying siege to it was not a good example to show the warriors.� The Wei general said, �The rebels are securely entrenched and want to take advantage of that to tire our army. If we besiege the city, we will be falling right into their trap. The rebels are massed here, so their homes are empty; if we head right for the local heartland, the people will be afraid. If they come to fight in fear, we are sure to beat them.� So the Wei army marched through in orderly ranks. When the secessionists saw the army, they came out after it and did actually try to face it. Then the Wei general had its own soldiers strike back at them, routing the rebels. Energy and Battle Liu Ji said: Generals wage war through the armed forces, the armed forces fight by energy. Energy prevails when it is drummed up. If you can energize your troops, don�t do it too frequently, otherwise their energy will easily wane. Don�t do it at too great a distance either, otherwise their energy will be easily exhausted. You should drum up the energy of your soldiers when enemies are within a calculated critical distance, having your troops fight at close range. When enemies wane and you prevail, victory over them is assured. The rule is �Fight when full of energy, flee when drained of energy� (Wei Liaozi, �Rigor of War�). During the Spring and Autumn era, the state of Qi attacked the state of Lu. The lord of Lu was about to go to battle when one of his warriors asked to accompany him. So the lord and the warrior rode to the battlefield in the same chariot. Now the lord of Lu was about to give the signal for the war drums to stir up the soldiers, but the warrior said, �Not yet.� Then when the men of Qi had drummed three times, the warrior told the lord of Lu, �Now!� The Qi army was defeated, and the lord of Lu asked the warrior how this had come about. The warrior replied, �Bravery in battle is a matter of energy. Once energy is drummed up, a second try makes it wane, and it disappears at the third. They were exhausted while we were full, so we overcame them.� This story was later told as a classic case of the weaker successfully opposing the stronger through mastery of energy. Fighting on the Way Home Liu Ji said: When you clash with enemies, if they withdraw and head home for no apparent reason, it is imperative to observe them carefully. If they are in fact exhausted and out of supplies, you can send commandos after them; but if they are an expedition on the way home, you cannot stand in their way. The rule is
