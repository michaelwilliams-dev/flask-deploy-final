will be able to withstand the inevitable empty moments of life and convert them into your own private pleasures. NOW THERE ARE�INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD RATHER PERISH THAN WORK WITHOUT TAKING PLEASURE IN THEIR WORK; THEY ARE CHOOSY�AND HAVE NO USE FOR AMPLE REWARDS IF THE WORK IS NOT ITSELF THE REWARD OF REWARDS�. THEY DO NOT FEAR BOREDOM AS MUCH AS WORK WITHOUT PLEASURE; INDEED, THEY NEED A LOT OF BOREDOM IF THEIR WORK IS TO SUCCEED. FOR�ALL INVENTIVE SPIRITS, BOREDOM IS THAT DISAGREEABLE �LULL� OF THE SOUL THAT PRECEDES A HAPPY VOYAGE AND CHEERFUL WINDS. �Friedrich Nietzsche CHAPTER 9 Push Beyond Your Limits�Self-Belief YOUR SENSE OF WHO YOU ARE WILL DETERMINE YOUR ACTIONS AND WHAT YOU END UP GETTING IN LIFE.

It was a particularly dangerous life for a female hustler, and so she built up an intimidating presence to protect herself. She was tougher and more fearless than many of the male dealers. Her only soft spot was her son�she wanted a different fate for him than hustling. To shelter him from the life she led, she had him stay with her parents in Southside Queens. As often as possible, she would show up with presents for the boy and to keep an eye on him. Some day soon they would move to a better place. As part of a drug beef, Sabrina was murdered at the age of twentythree, and from that moment on, it looked like Curtis�s fate in this world had been sealed. He was now essentially alone�no parents or real mentor to give him a sense of direction. It seemed almost certain that the following scenario would play itself out: He would drift towards life on the streets. To prove his toughness, he would eventually have to resort to violence and crime. He would find his way into the prison
