itself; never let them know your design. [Literally, "do not tell them words;" i.e. do not give your reasons for any order. Lord Mansfield once told a junior colleague to "give no reasons" for his decisions, and the maxim is even more applicable to a general than to a judge.] When the outlook is bright, bring it before their eyes; but tell them nothing when the situation is gloomy. 1. Place your army in deadly peril, and it will survive; plunge it into desperate straits, and it will come off in safety. CHAPTER 12. THE NINE SITUATIONS 111 [These words of Sun Tzu were once quoted by Han Hsin in explanation of the tactics he employed in one of his most brilliant battles, already al- luded to on p. 28. In 204 B.C., he was sent against the army of Chao, and halted ten miles from the mouth of the Ching-hsing pass, where the enemy had mustered in full force. Here, at midnight, he detached a body of 2000 light cavalry, every man of which was furnished with a red flag. Their instructions were to make their way through narrow defiles and keep a secret watch on the enemy. "When the men of Chao see me in full flight," Han Hsin said, "they will abandon their fortifications and give chase. This must be the sign for you to rush in, pluck down the Chao standards and set up the red banners of Han in their stead." Turning then to his other officers, he remarked: "Our adversary holds a strong position, and is not likely to come out and attack us until he sees the standard and drums of the commander-in-chief, for fear I should turn back and escape through the mountains."

By this time it was broad daylight, and Han Hsin, display- ing the generalissimo�s flag, marched out of the pass with drums beating, and was immediately engaged by the enemy. A great battle followed, last- ing for some time; until at length Han Hsin and his colleague Chang Ni, leaving drums and banner on the field, fled to the division on the river bank, where another fierce battle was raging. The enemy rushed out to pursue them and to secure the trophies, thus denuding their ramparts of men; but the two generals succeeded in joining the other army, which was fighting with the utmost desperation. The time had now come for the 2000 horsemen to play their part. As soon as they saw the men of Chao fol- lowing up their advantage, they galloped behind the deserted walls, tore up the enemy�s flags and replaced them by those of Han. When the Chao army looked back from the pursuit, the sight of these red flags struck them
