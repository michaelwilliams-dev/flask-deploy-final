is no danger� (�Fire Attack�). The sixth and topmost element of the �Contention� hexagram represents aggressive people in high positions, �at the peak of power and also at the end of contention,� Cheng Yi says, �characteristic of those who bring contention to its ultimate conclusion.� Here this means people who adamantly pursue contention to its final limit; Cheng Yi says, �When they indulge in their strength, and when they get desperate, people resort to contention, thus causing themselves trouble and even destroying themselves, a logical conclusion.� Liu Ji, the scholar-warrior whose recitals of history and military science are presented in Part Two of this book, applies this principle to the monumental Sui dynasty. The Sui dynasty briefly united China in the late sixth century, after hundreds of years of civil and colonial warfare. Speaking of the second emperor, who inherited the empire his father had labored to consolidate, Liu Ji said, �It is not that his country was not large, nor that his people were not many. But he made a hobby of martial arts, and he liked to fight; so he practiced with his weapons every day, and went on endless expeditions to attack neighboring peoples. Then things took a turn, and his army was beaten while his cabinet opposed him. Is he not ridiculous to people of later generations? Had human rulers not better be careful?� Aggressive and contentious people in high positions, used to getting their way, do not suffer only when they happen to fail; even in success they are in danger, for this success itself becomes an object of contention that continues to animate the aggressive tendencies of all people on this level. The I Ching�s statement on this point says, �Honor given you will be taken away from you three times before the day is out.� According to Cheng Yi, in a military, governmental, or other institutional context, �even if people contend successfully to the end, until they are rewarded for service to the regime, this reward is still an object of contention�how can it be kept secure?� Liu Ji gives an excellent version of the traditional formulation of the answer among the rules of war related in his history stories: �When you have won, be as if you had not.� When contention is taken to its limit, it becomes conflict, and conflict taken to extremes leads to armament and war. Therefore the hexagram following �Contention� in the conventional order of the I Ching is the hexagram for �The Army.� The word used for this sign has a whole family of meanings, including �a military force,� �a military expedition,� and �a military leader.� From the last sense is derived another common usage of the same Chinese character, the meaning of �teacher, director, or master of an art or science.� The idea of the teacher fits in with the needs of military command or general crisis management; and the image of war is also used in both Taoism and Buddhism as a general metaphor for
