deceive Albinus .He wrote Albinus that though he was elected Emperor bythe Senate hewanted to share the honor with him ,giving him the title ofCeasar ,and by deliberation ofthe Senate making him his equal .Albinus ac- cepted allthis asreal .But once Severius had put Pescennius to 104—Niccolò Machiavelli death, andreestablished peace intheEast, assoon ashereturned toRome hetoldtheSenate thatAlbinus wasnotgrateful ofthe honor hehadreceived andtried tokillhim. Hewasthus obliged togoandpunish Albinus. Hewent toFrance, stripped himofhis state andkilled him. Whoever examines carefully Severius’ actions will seehe wasferocious asalionandasastute asafox.Hewasfeared and revered generally andnothated bythearmy. Noonewillbesur- prised thateven asanew Prince hewasable torulesomuch em- pire. Hisgreat reputation learned thehatred thatthepeople might have hadforhisrapaciousness. ButAntoninus, hisson,known as Caracalla, aman who hadgreat qualities andimpressed thepeo- pleandsatisfied thesoldiers asamilitary many who bore every burden anddespised delicacies andevery softness. This hissol- diers admired. Buthiscruelty andferocity were sogreat andun- heard offirstmurdering individuals andthen massacring crowds ofRomans and Alexandrians that hebecame loathed bythe world. Even those near tohimbegan tofearhimsothatfinally he was cutdown byoneofhisown centurions inthemidst ofhis army. Such deaths, engineered byahostile person, areinevitable for aPrince. Anyone notafraid ofdeath canharm him. But, because such incidents arevery rare, aPrince should notfearthem. He should instead seek toavoid insulting anyone herelies onand who hasclose access tohim. Antoninus didthisbycalumniating abrother ofthecenturion, threatening himevery day,while atthe same time keeping him intheguard. This seems foolish and likely toruinhim, which itdid. Buttake thecase ofCommodius who could easily have held theEmpire together having legitimately inherited itasthesonof Marcus Aurelius. Heonly needed tofollow inthefootsteps ofhis father andhewould have been popular with thesoldiers andthe people. Buthewas acruel andbestial person. Toexploit the populace, heencouraged hisarmy toberapacious andlicentious. Hedidnotmaintain hisdignity ofperson andoften went down intothetheater tocombat with thegladiators. Vile andundigni THE PRINCE —105 fied, sullying themajesty ofhisoffice, helosttherespect ofthe army. Hated bythepeople andscorned bythearmy, conspirators took hislife. There remains thefigure ofMassiminius. Hewasavery war- likefigure. Thearmies were tired ofAlexander's softness. Onhis death, they elected Massiminius emperor. Hedidn't lastlong. Two things militated against him: hislowbackground, having herded sheep inThrace (this waswidely known andputhimlow inesteem intheeyes ofeveryone), andhishaving atthestart of hisreign putoffgoing toRome andhisreputation forcruelty based onthedelegation inRome andelsewhere ofvery hard pre- fects. Because ofhislowrank, hate andfearofhispractices, the African provinces rebelled first, then Rome, then allofItaly. Then hisarmy joined therevolt. Thearmy wasencamped atAc- quila; since itwashard togetridofhimotherwise, andtheywere impatient with hiscruelty, andhisother enemies rose against him, they simply killed him. Idon’t want todiscuss Eleogabalus, sonofMacrinus —son ofJulian, who wasgotten ridofimmediately, soIwillconclude thediscourse. Princes ofourtime have lessdifficulty satisfying thearmies andgovernments. They have togive itsome attention butcanresolve thismore quickly since these Princes arenot compromised byarmies andoffices involved inprovincial ad- ministrations, aswere theRoman military. Then itwasnecessary toplay more tothearmies because they hadmore influence than thepeople. Now, except fortheSultans ofTurkey andGreece, thePrinces owe more tothepeople because thepeople exercise more influence. TheTurkish Sultan isanexception because hekeeps twelve thousand infantry andfifteen thousand cavalry close athand. The security andstrength oftherealm depend onthem. Above all,the Sultan needs tokeep them friendly. Similarly theSultan ofEgypt who isinthehands ofthesoldiers. Healso, regardless ofthe people, must keep thearmy friendly. Note thatEgypt under the Sultan differs from other Principalities, because itislike the Christian papacy,
