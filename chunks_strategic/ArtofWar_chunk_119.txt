well as material, and it was believed that moral power manifested itself both as self-mastery and as influence over others. To explain the strength of a national defense force, Zhuge writes: This in turn depends on the generals entrusted with military leadership. A general that is not popular is not a help to the nation, not a leader of the army. A general who is �not popular� is one who, according to another way of reading the characters, �denies the people.� Sun Tzu emphasizes the unity of wills as a fundamental source of strength, and his minimalist philosophy of warfare is a natural outgrowth of the central idea of common interest; on the basis of this principle, Zhuge Liang again quotes the Tao-te Ching to express the ideal of the sage warrior concerned for the body of society as a whole ��Weapons are instruments of ill omen, to be used only when it is unavoidable.� Zhuge also follows The Art of War closely in his emphasis on avoiding action without strategy as well as action without need: The way to use weapons is to carry out operations only after having first determined your strategy. Carefully examine the patterns of the climate and terrain, and look into the hearts of the people. Train in the use of military equipment, make patterns of rewards and punishments clear, observe the strategy of opponents, watch out for dangerous passes enroute, distinguish places of safety and danger, find out the conditions of both sides, be aware of when to advance and when to withdraw, adapt to the timing of circumstances, set up defensive measures while strengthening your attack force, promote soldiers for their ability, draw up plans for success, consider the matter of life and death�only when you have done all this can you send forth armies entrusted to generals that will reach out with the power to capture opponents. Speed and coordination, central to success in battle according to Sun Tzu�s art of war, also derive not only from strategic preparedness, but from the psychological cohesion on which leadership depends; Zhuge writes: A general is a commander, a useful tool for a nation. First determining strategy then carrying it out, his command is as though borne afloat on a torrent, his conquest is like a hawk striking its prey. Like a drawn bow when still, like a machine starting up in action, he breaks through wherever he turns, and even powerful enemies perish. If the general has no foresight and the soldiers lack impetus, mere strategy without unification of wills cannot suffice to strike fear into an enemy even if you have a million troops. Mentioning Sun Tzu�s classic as the ultimate manual for successful strategy, Zhuge concludes his essay on military organization by summing up the main points of The Art of War as he incorporated them into his own practice, centering on those aspects of the training and mood of warriors that derive from Taoist tradition: Have no hard feelings toward anyone
