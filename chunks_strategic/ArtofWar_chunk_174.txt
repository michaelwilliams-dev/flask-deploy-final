surprise attack force that gets there first, even though it sets out last. Master Sun Therefore armed struggle is considered profitable, and armed struggle is considered dangerous. CAO CAO For the skilled it is profitable, for the unskilled it is dangerous. Master Sun To mobilize the whole army to struggle for advantage would take too long, yet to struggle for advantage with a stripped-down army results in a lack of equipment. So if you travel light, not stopping day or night, doubling your usual pace, struggling for an advantage a hundred miles away, your military leaders will be captured. Strong soldiers will get there first, the weary later on�as a rule, one in ten make it. JIA LIN When the road is long the people are weary; if their strength has been used up in travel, then they are worn out while their opponents are fresh, so they are sure to be attacked. Master Sun Struggling for an advantage fifty miles away will thwart the forward leadership, and as a rule only fifty percent of the soldiers make it. Struggle for an advantage thirty miles away, and two out of three get there. So an army perishes if it has no equipment, it perishes if it has no food, and it perishes if it has no money.

Master Sun Unless you know the mountains and forests, the defiles and impasses, and the lay of the marshes and swamps, you cannot maneuver with an armed force. Unless you use local guides, you cannot get the advantages of the land. LI QUAN When you go into enemy territory, you need local people to guide you along the most convenient routes, lest you be hemmed in by mountains and rivers, get bogged down on swampy ground, or lack access to springs and wells. This is what the I Ching means when it says, �Chasing deer without a guide only takes you into the bush.� ZHANG YU Only when you know every detail of the lay of the land can you maneuver and contend. MEI YAOCHEN Local guides can be captured or recruited, but it is best to have developed professional scouts, who need not be people of a specific area. Master Sun So a military force is established by deception, mobilized by gain, and adapted by division and combination. DU MU A military force is established by deception in the sense that you deceive enemies so that they do not know your real condition, and then
