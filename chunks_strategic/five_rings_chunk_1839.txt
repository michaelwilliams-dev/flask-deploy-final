"And it'sthejustmanwho isgood?" "Certainly." "Then itisnotthework ofthejustman toharm either afriend or anyone else,Polemarchus, butofhisopposite, theunjust man." "Inmyopinion, Socrates," hesaid, "what you say isentirely true." "Then ifsomeone asserts that it'sjust togivewhat isowed toeach e man—andheunderstands bythisthatharm isowed toenemies bythe justmanandhelp tofriends—themanwho said itwasnotwise. Forhe wasn't telling thetruth. For ithasbecome apparent tousthat itisnever justtoharm anyone." "Iagree," hesaid. "We shall dobattle then aspartners, youand I," Isaid, "if someone asserts thatSimonides, orBias, orPittacus^ oranyother wiseandblessed man said it." "I,forone," hesaid,"amready tobeyourpartner inthebattle." "Doyouknow," Isaid, "towhom, inmyopinion, thatsaying 336a belongs which asserts that itisjust tohelp friends andharm ene- mies?" "Towhom?" hesaid. "Isuppose itbelongs toPeriander, orPerdiccas, orXerxes, or Ismenias theTheban,^^ orsome other richmanwho has ahigh opinion ofwhathecando." "What yousay isvery true," hesaid. "All right," Isaid, "since ithasbecome apparent that neither justice northejust isthis,what elsewould onesaythey are?" NowThrasymachus hadmany times started outtotakeover the b argument inthemidst ofourdiscussion, buthehadbeen restrained by themen sitting nearhim,whowanted tohear theargument out.But whenwepaused and Isaid this, hecould nolonger keep quiet; hunched uplikeawild beast, heflung himself atusasiftotearus topieces. Then bothPolemarchus and Igot allinaflutter from fright. Andheshouted outintoourmidst and said,"What isthisnonsense thathaspossessed youforsolong, Socrates? Andwhydoyou actlike c foolsmaking way foroneanother? Ifyou truly want toknow what thejust is,don't only askand gratify your love ofhonor byrefuting whatever someone answers—youknow that itiseasier toaskthan to answer—butanswer yourself andsaywhat you assert thejust tobe. Andseetoityoudon't tellmethat itistheneedful, orthehelpful, d ortheprofitable, orthe gainful, ortheadvantageous; but tellme [13 ] THHASYMACHUS/SOCRATES THEREPUBLIC 336d clearly andprecisely what youmean, forI'won't accept itifyousay such inanities." Iwasastounded when Iheard him, and,looking athim, Iwas frightened. Ithink that ifIhadnotseenhimbefore hesawme, Iwould have been speechless.^" As itwas, justwhen hebegan tobeex- asperated bytheargument, Ihadlooked athim first, sothat Iwasable e toanswer him;andwith justatrace ofatremor, Isaid:"Thrasyma- chus, don'tbehardonus.Ifwearemaking anymistake inthecon- sideration ofthearguments, Polemarchus and I,know well thatwe're making anunwilling mistake. Ifwewere searching forgoldwewould never willingly makeway foroneanother inthesearch andruinour chances offinding it;sodon't suppose thatwhenweareseeking for justice, athingmore precious than agreat dealofgold,wewould ever foolishly give intooneanother andnotbeasserious aswecanbe about bringing ittolight. Don't yousuppose that,myfriend! Rather, as Isuppose, wearenotcompetent. Soit'ssurely farmore fitting forusto 337a bepitied byyouclevermenthan tobetreated harshly." He listened, burst outlaughing very scornfully, and said, "Heracles! Here isthathabitual irony ofSocrates. Iknew it,and Ipre- dicted tothese fellows thatyouwouldn't bewilling toanswer, that youwould beironic anddoanything rather thananswer ifsomeone asked yousomething." "That's because youarewise, Thrasymachus," Isaid."Hence you knew quite well that ifyouasked someone howmuch twelve isand in b asking toldhimbeforehand, 'See toityoudon't tellme,youhuman being, that itistwotimes six,orthree times four, orsixtimes two, or fourtimes three; Iwon't accept suchnonsense from you'—itwasplain toyou, Isuppose, thatnoonewould answer amanwho asks inthis way.And ifheasked, 'Thrasymachus, what doyoumean? Shall I answer none ofthose youmentioned before? Even ifithappens tobe oneofthese, shall Isaysomething other than thetruth, yousurprising c man?Orwhat doyoumean?'—whatwould yousaytohim inre- sponse?" "Very well," hesaid, "as ifthiscasewere similar totheother." "Nothing prevents itfrom being," Isaid."And even granting that it'snotsimilar, butlooks like itistothemanwho isasked, doyou think he'llanythelessanswer what appears tohim,whether weforbid him toornot?" "Well, isthatwhatyouaregoing todo?"hesaid."Areyougoing togive asananswer oneofthose Iforbid?" "Ishouldn't besurprised," Isaid, "ifthatweremyopinion upon consideration." [14 i Book I/336d-338c
