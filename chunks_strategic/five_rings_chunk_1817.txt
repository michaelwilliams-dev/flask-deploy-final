tooccupy thepopulace with feasts andspectaculars. Since every cityisdivided inquarters andguilds, hehastocultivate them and sometimes visit them, andexemplify humanity andmunificence tothem. Always heshould cultivate hispersonal majesty and dignity. This should never belacking inanything. ONSECRETARIES THE PRINCE SHOULD HAVE NEAR HIM OfTheyfirstimportancethoughtwill toaPrince istheselection ofhisministers. begood orbadaccording tohischoice. His istoselect persons close tohim. Ifthey are capable andloyal, itisalways wise totapthem because the prince knows them andcommands their loyalty. Butifthey are notcapable, their selection will reflect badly onhisreputation. This isthefirsterror hemakes. Those who knew Antonio daVenafro (Antonio Giordani, Minister ofSiena, 1502-1512), Pandolfo Petrucci's minister, praised himasavaliant man forselecting such aminister. There arethree types ofministerial mind: first, those who un- derstand themselves; second, those who perceive what others in- tend; third, those who understand neither themselves norothers. The first kind make excellent ministers, thesecond kind make excellent ministers, thethird kind areuseless. Pandolfo himself, though isnotthefirstkind; luckily, hewasthesecond kind —by understanding thegood orbadofwhat others said, even though hedidnotknow himself, hecould judge whether aminister acted rightly ornot.Hecould advance andcorrect others. Norcould a minister hope tofoolhimandstayinoffice. How canaPrince evaluate aminister? Thefollowing guide- linenever fails: when aminister thinks more ofhimself than of youandlooks always forhisown advantage youcanbesure: a) hewon't beagood minister andb)youcan't trust him. Whoever isengaged bythestate should never think ofhimself butofthe Prince. Hisfirstconcern should bewhat concerns thePrince. On theother side, thePrince should, tocurry theminister, think of him, honor him, make him rich, obligate him tohimself, and shower theminister with honors andoffices sothathecannot do THE PRINCE —119 without thePrince, andsothatheneed notdesire other honors andother riches, andhistask andoffices make him wary of changing things. When things arethus arranged, minister to Prince, andPrince tominister, they canconfide inandcooperate with each other. Any other relation willbeharmful toboth. HOW TOESCAPE FLATTERERS Ishould mention animportant problem thatPrinces canonly avoidflatterers withandtheadulatorsutmost prudence— orwith discretion. Ispeak of thecourts arefullofthem. Since men indulge their own persons, anddeceive themselves, itishard todefend oneself against thisweakness. Ifonedoes defend one- self, there isariskofnotbeing popular. Theonly way toguard against flatterers istohave men tellyouthetruth —butwhen they tellyouthetruth, there isriskofbeing irreverent. SoaPrince should cultivate athird way, appointing wise counselors, giving only them theprivilege ofspeaking plainly andtelling thetruth, andonly when asked andnototherwise. But oneshould inquire with them about everything, andlisten to them. Then oneshould take counsel with oneself. With each of these counselors oneshould behave insuch awaythattheyknow thatthemore openly theyspeak themore accepted they are.Don' tlisten toanyone else. Follow uponwhat they sayanddon't be putoff.Whoever does notdothiseither falls intothehands of flatterers orwobbles among various opinions —which detract from your reputation. Iwant tobring uponemodern example. Luca Rinaldi (a bishop andconfidant ofEmperor Maximillian ofHapsburg) was talking ofhisMajesty andsaid henever took counsel with any- oneordidwhat they said—which went against theadvice given above. TheEmperor wasasecretive man andtoldnooneofhis plans norasked advice ofanyone. Hisplans became known as they were putintoeffect, whereupon people started tocomment andopinionate. The Emperor, easily influenced, would start to change hismind. Hewould start toundo what hebegan todo. Since noonecould fathom what hewanted todo,noonecould base hisorherplans onhis. THE PRINCE —-121 So,aPrince should consult continuously ,only when hewants to,not when the others want to.He has tobe short with those who offer counsel
