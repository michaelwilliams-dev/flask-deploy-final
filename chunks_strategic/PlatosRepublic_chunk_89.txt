it would be tame and orderly?" "That's so." "And we do say that the guardians must have both of these two natures." "Yes, they must." "Then mustn't they be harmonized with one another?" "Of course." "And the soul of the man thus harmonized is moderate and courageous?" 411 411 a b C d e '12 a "Certainly." "And that of the inharmonious man is cowardly and crude?" "Of course." "Then, when a man gives himself to music and lets the flute play and pour into his soul through his ears, as it were into a funnel-using those sweet, soft, wailing harmonies we were just speaking of-and spends his whole life humming and exulting in song, at first, whatever spiritedness he had; he softened like iron and made useful from having been useless and hard. But when he keeps at it without letting up and charms his spirit, he, as the next step, already begins to melt and li? quefy his spirit, until he dissolves it completely and cuts out, as it were, the sinews from his soul and makes it 'a feeble warrior.' "62 "Most certainly," he said. "And," I said, "if from the start he got a spiritless soul from nature, he accomplishes this quickly. But if it's spirited, the spirit is weakened and made temperamental, quickly inflamed by little things and quickly extinguished. Thus these men have become quick? tempered and irritable from having been spirited, and they are filled with discontent." "Quite so." "Now what about the man who labors a great deal at gymnastic and feasts himself really well but never touches music and philosophy?

"That's so," he said. "Then, I suppose, such a man becomes a misologist63 and un? musical. He no longer makes any use of persuasion by means of speech but goes about everything with force and savageness, like a wild beast; and he live,s ignorantly and awkwardly without rhythm or grace." "Exactly," he said, "that's the way it is." "Now I, for one, would assert that some god gave two arts to hu? man beings for these two things, as it seems-music and ï¿½gymnastic for the spirited and the philosophic-not for soul and body, except inci? dentally, but rather for these two. He did so in order that they might be harmonized with one another by being tuned to the proper degree of tension and relaxation." "Yes, it does seem so," he_said. 412 a "Then the man who makes the finest mixture
