his par? ticular qualities. Throughout, Glaucon and Adeimantus have balanced each other, and they are perfectly matched as interlocutors. Without their specific characters and Socrates� judicious blending of them, the founding of the city in speech would have been impossible. Glaucon is the daring, manly lover of victory whose eros leads him directly to the conquest of the good things as he sees them, and whose spiritedness aids him in his endeavor. He is responsible for the progress of the dialogue: it is Glaucon who wanted to go to the Piraeus to see the festival, and who decided for both Socrates and himself that they would heed Polemarchus and Adeimantus and stay. It is Glaucon who was perplexed and interested by Socrates' discussion of payments for ruling; it is he who insisted on continuing the argument about justice and most convincingly portrayed the advantages of injustice. Moreover, it is Glaucon whose appetites forced the abandonment of the city of sows, who compelled Socrates to tell of all the virtues, to in? troduce the philosopher-kings, and to discuss the good. Glaucon�s feverish intensity is the impulse that carries the discussion forward to the greatest innovations and the most extreme satisfaction. Adeimantus, by contrast, is a moderate man and a lover of tragic poetry. His spiritedness is directed inward and it makes him austere. He is thus a more reliable citizen than Glaucon with his many and powerful desires. He is a moralist and a defender of civil life. He was the one who, by the promise of interesting sights, persuaded Glaucon and Socrates to join the little community of men in the Piraeus. It is Adeimantus who helped Socrates to build the healthy city, and he was contented with it. He is the agent of the purification of the feverish city. And, above all, he is the accuser of Socrates, the one who forces him to stop and justify himself to the city. Adeimantus speaks in the name of the political men who are offended and threatened by both Glaucon's and Socrates' unconventional notions. He accuses Socrates of not making the warriors happy, of robbing his friends of an adequate discussion of communism, and of imposing useless or Vicious philosophers on the city as rulers. He is necessary to the building of a city; and he is necessary to that punishment of the bodily passions which is the condition of Glaucon's reformation. Just as Glaucon is dangerous because he is a potential subverter of the laws, Adeimantus is dangerous because he is a potential accuser of philosophy. Just as Glaucon can be useful because he tends toward philosophy, so Adei? mantus can be useful because he tends toward public spiritedness. In Books VIII and IX Adeimantus finally ceases being Socrates' opponent and becomes his wholehearted ally. For at this point a city has been founded in speech of which Socrates is a member; thus, in de? fending this city, Adeimantus is also defending Socrates. His moralism and moral indignation are now
