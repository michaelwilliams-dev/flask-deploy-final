surround herself with a.bevy ofadmirers, a harem from which tochoose herlovers. The system, though, dependedon one critical factor: thepossibility, however remote, that amartyrcould become afawn". The illusion that riches, glory,orsensual satisfaction may someday fallintoyour victim's lap isanirresistible carrot toinclude inyour listofchoices. Thathope,how- ever slim, will make men accept the most ridiculous situations, because it leaves them theallimportant optionofadream. The illusion ofchoice, married tothepossibility offuture good fortune, will lure the most stub born sucker intoyour glittering web. KEYS TO POWER Words like“freedom,” “options,” and “choice” evoke apowerofpossibility farbeyond therealityofthebenefits theyentail. When examined closely, thechoices wehave——in themarketplace,inelections, inourjobs»-tendto have noticeable limitations: Theyareoften amatter ofachoice simplybe- tween Aand B,with the restofthealphabetoutofthepicture.Yet aslong asthefaintest mirage ofchoice flickers on, werarelyfocus onthemissing options. We“choose” tobelieve that thegameisfair, and that wehave our freedom. Weprefernot tothink toomuch about thedepth ofourlibertyto choose. This unwillingness toprobe thesmallness ofour choices stems from thefactthat toomuch freedom creates akind ofamdety.The phrase “un- limited options” sounds infinitely promising,butunlimited options would actually paralyzeusand cloud ourabilitytochoose. Our limited range of choices comforts us. This suppliestheclever andcunningwith enormous opportunities for deception.Forpeoplewho arechoosingbetween alternatives find ithard tobelieve theyarebeing manipulatedordeceived; they cannot seethat youareallowing them asmall amount offree will inexchange for amuch more powerful imposition ofyourown will. Setting upanarrow range of choices, then, should alwaysbe apart ofyour deceptions. There isasay- ing:Ifyoucangetthebird towalk into thecageonitsown, itwillsingthat much more prettily. Thefollowingareamong themost common forms of“controllingthe options”: Color theChoices. This was afavored techniqueofHenry Kissinger.As President Richard Nixon’s secretary ofstate, Kissinger considered himself better informed than hisboss, andbelieved that inmost situations hecould make thebest decision onhis own. Butifhetried todetermine policy,he would offend orperhaps enrageanotoriouslyinsecure man. SoKissinger wouldproposethree orfour choices ofaction foreach situation, andwould presentthem insuch awaythat the one hepreferred always seemed the best solution comparedtothe others. Time afler time, Nixon fellforthe bait, never suspectingthat he wasmovingwhere Kissinger pushedhim. This isanexcellent device touse ontheinsecure master. Force theResistor. One ofthemain problemsfaced byDr.Milton H.Er- ickson, apioneer ofhypnosis therapyinthe1950s, wastherelapse.Hispa» tients mightseem toberecovering rapidly,buttheir apparent susceptibility tothetherapymasked adeepresistance: Theywould soon relapse into old habits, blame thedoctor, andstop coming toseehim. Toavoid this, Ericlo sonbegan orderingsome patientstohave arelapse,tomake themselves feel asbad aswhen theyfirst came in—-——togoback tosquareone. Faced with thisoption,thepatientswould usually“choose” toavoid therelapse- which, ofcourse, was what Erickson really wanted. This isagood techniquetouse onchildren and other willful people whoenjoy doing theopposite ofwhat you ask them to:Push them to “choose” whatyouwant them todobyappearingtoadvocate theopposite. Alter thePlaying Field. Inthe1860s,johnD.Rockefeller setouttocre- ate anoilmonopoly.Ifhetried tobuy upthesmaller oilcompanies they would figure outwhat hewasdoingandfight back. Instead, hebeganse- cretly buying uptherailway companiesthattransportedtheoil.When he thenattemptedtotake over aparticular company,and met with resistance, hereminded them oftheir dependenceontherails. Refusing them ship- ping,orsimply raising their fees, could ruin their business. Rockefeller a.l~ tered theplaying field sothat theonly options thesmall oilproducershad were the ones hegavethem. Inthis tacticyour opponentsknow their hand isbeing forced, butit doesn’t matter. The techniqueiseffective againstthose who resist atall costs. LAW 31 259 2&0 LAW’ 31The Shrinking Options. The latemineteenth-centuryartdealer Am- broise Vollard perfectedthistechnique. Customers would come toVolla.rd’s shoptosee some Cézannes.
