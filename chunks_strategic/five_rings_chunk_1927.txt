"Inmyopinion," Isaid, "it'snoignoble conception youhave for yourself ofwhat thestudy ofthethings above is.Even ifamanwere to b learn something bytilting hisheadbackandlooking atdecorations on aceiling, youwould probably believe hecontemplates with hisintellect andnothiseyes.Perhaps your belief isafineoneandmine innocent. I, formypart,amunable tohold thatanystudy makes asoullook up- ward other thantheonethatconcerns what isand isinvisible. And ifa man, gaping up^^* orsquinting down, attempts tolearn something of sensible things, Iwould deny thatheever learns—forthere isno c knowledge ofsuch things—orthathissoullooks up,rather thandown, even ifhelearns while floating onhisbackonland orsea." "Iampaying thejustpenalty," hesaid."You areright inre- proaching me.But justwhat didyoumean when you said that [208] Book VII/528c-530c glaucon/socrates astronomy mustbestudied inaway contrary totheone inwhich 529c theynowstudy it,ifit'sgoing tobestudied inaway that's helpful forwhatwearetalking about?" "Asfollows," Isaid."These decorations intheheaven, since they areembroidered onavisible ceiling, maybebelieved tobethefairest andmost precise ofsuch things; butthey fallfarshort ofthetrueones, d thosemovements inwhich thereally fastandthereally slow— intrue number and inallthetrue figures—aremoved with respect toone another and intheir turnmove what iscontained inthem. They, of course, mustbegrasped byargument andthought, notsight.Ordoyou suppose otherwise?" "Not atall,"hesaid. "Therefore," Isaid, "thedecoration intheheaven mustbeused as patterns forthesake oflearning these other things, justasifonewere tocomeupon diagrams exceptionally carefully drawn andworked out e byDaedalus orsome other craftsman orpainter. Amanexperienced in geometry would, onseeing such things, presumably believe thatthey arefairest intheir execution butthat itisridiculous toconsider them seriously asthough onewere tograsp thetruth about equals, doubles, oranyother proportion inthem." 530a "How could itbeanything butridiculous?" hesaid. "Then," Isaid, "don't yousuppose thatamanwho isreally anas- :tronomer willhave thesame persuasion inlooking atthemovements of thestars?Hewillhold thatthecraftsman^^ ofheaven composed it andwhat's initasbeautifully assuchworks canbecomposed.

"Therefore," Isaid,"bytheuseofproblems, asingeometry, we shall alsopursue astronomy; andweshall letthethings intheheaven 'go, ifbyreally taking part inastronomy wearegoing toconvert the ^prudence bynature inthesoulfrom uselessness tousefulness." c "The taskyouprescribe," hesaid, "ismany times greater than what isnowdone inastronomy."
