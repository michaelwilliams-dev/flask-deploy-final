has ended: The Martial Lord of Wei asked one of his ministers what had caused the destruction of a certain nation-state. The minister said, �Repeated victories in repeated wars.� The Martial Lord said, �A nation is fortunate to win repeated victories in repeated wars. Why would that cause its destruction?� The minister said, �Where there are repeated wars, the people are weakened; when they score repeated victories, rulers become haughty. Let haughty rulers command weakened people, and rare is the nation that will not perish as a result.� Eventually the whole range of Chinese thought on the practicalities of life was inherited by the Chan Buddhists, who subjected the understanding of every school of ideas to the most rigorous examination in order to cull the essence and sense of each one. Thus one of the most excellent presentations of the hierarchy of Chinese philosophies of war can be found in the writings of the illustrious eleventh-century Buddhist Mingjiao, who was a scholar and historian as well as a master of Chan Buddhist mysticism: The use of arms is for dealing with criminal acts; it comes from humanitarianism and is based on justice. It comes from humanitarianism in the sense of sympathy for those whose lives are being disrupted, and is based on justice in the sense of stopping violence. When violence is stopped justly, there is mutual realignment, not mutual disturbance. When those whose lives are disrupted are pitied for humanitarian reasons, plans are made to foster life, not to kill. Therefore the armed actions of the idealized leaders of ancient times are called corrective punishments and campaigns for justice. When social cohesion waned and the Warring States era set in, the course of military science changed: humanitarianism and justice faded out; instead military affairs came from violence and went to treachery. Strong states became unrestrained through militarism, large states grew arrogant because of their armies, angry states used their weapons to incite disturbance, and greedy states used their armed forces to invade others. �Military action is a perverse affair, used by the civilized only when unavoidable.� Therefore sages value moral power, not military power. This is why those who understand military science should not run the world alone. �Putting on armor is not the way to promote a country�s welfare; it is for eliminating violence.� �A lost country wars with weapons; a dictatorship wars with cunning; a kingdom wars with humanitarian justice; an empire wars with virtue; a utopia wars with nondoing.� A later Chan Buddhist, also an enlightened scholar and poet, added other points of view to his predecessor�s account of the classical philosophies of war. He recorded his observations in hauntingly beautiful poetry while hiding in the mountains after falling victim to an intrigue. A strong Taoist element, part of the ancient heritage of Chan Buddhism, is evident in the poet�s incisive vision of history and impartial understanding of the beauty and tragedy of contending interests in the course of human life.
