the thesis of Thrasyma? chus. This teaching is the application to po1itics of what has come to be known as pre-Socratic philosophy. The results of the study of nature led the earlier philosophers to believe that there is no cosmic suppo1t for justice, that the gods, if they exist at all, have no care for men. Justice is, then, merely human convention and hence a matter of indif? ference to those who wish to live according to nature. This does not necessarily lead to the consequence that one must desire to become a tyrant, for it is possible to care for things which cannot be procured by political life, for example, philosophy. But, in general, most men do care for the political life or things which can best be procured by it. Soph? ists and rhetoricians extract the political significance from the philosophers' knowledge of nature. They teach that the proper study of politics is not the laws or justice, for they are phantasms, but rhetoric, the means of getting one's way. At best, then, the study of nature ap? parently leads to indifference to the city and its laws; at worst it leads to tyranny. This was the suspicion of the Athenian demos, and it may very well be the case. Devotion to justice or the opposite is not simply a question of decency or corruption but one of the truth of things. And if what Thrasymachus teaches is the truth, the city in se1f-defense must suppress that truth. It may be recalled that Socrates was accused of being a proponent of this pre-Socratic philosophy so inimical to the city's interest and a teacher of rhetoric. The Rep11blic defends Socrates against this accusa? tion: here he is shown to be the protector of justice against a rhetori? cian. Of course, he does not simply defend the justice of the ancestral laws of the city; his is a philosophic response to a philosophic challenge, and therefore it, too, is subversive of the ancestral. This response cannot merely be an exhortation to the practice of justice; it must also attempt to find a natural support for justice. The study of justice therefore leads to the study of nature; the character of justice depends on the character of nature as a whole. Hence the Republic, beginning with justice, must be a comprehensive book. In being forced to defend justice, Socrates is forced to enter forbidden realms and to expound novel conceits. Innocence once lost cannot be regained; the substitute is philosophizing in the fullest sense. ,{ ;.1 �-; 1= �,.�.�_. I,,,,.,, 11 fJ1 Although Socrates is not depicted as a practitioner of rhetoric, his appeal to Glaucon and Adeimantus stems from a kind of rhetoric which succeeded in silencing the master rhetorician Thrasymachus without truly refuting him. Socrates controlled the discussion from the outset in such a way as to involve them while, and in, posing the prob? lem of justice in its most radical form. The confrontation with Thra? symachus was
