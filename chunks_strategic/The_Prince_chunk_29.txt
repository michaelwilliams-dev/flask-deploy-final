be attributed either to fortune or virtue. Without either, he reached his goal. In our times, with Pope Alexander VI reigning, Oliverotto Uf.freducci of Fermo lost his father at an early age and was raised by a maternal uncle, Giovanni Pigliani. At an early age he also joined the army under Paolo Vitelli and rose to officer. When Paolo died (decapitated for suspected treason, 1499 � he served in the Florentine war against Pisa), Oliverotto fought for a while with Vitellozzo, Paolo's brother. In a short time, ingenious, dash.ing, and brave, became head of the militia. But service with he others seemed to him demeaning and he decided, with the help of some citizens of Fermo who were more used to servitude than freedom, and with the help of Vitellozzo, to occupy Fermo. He wrote he his uncle Giovanni Fogliani that as had been away from home many years he would like to return and see him and his city and reclaim some of his patrimony. He had spent his time in search of honor and he said, to show he had not worked in vain, that he wanted to ride in with a hundred horses and servants and he hoped Fogliani would receive him with honors.

Everybody was dead who might have objected and now civil and martial laws were passed. Within a year, Oliverotto was secure in Fermo and a source of intimidation to all his neighbors. It would have been as difficult to remove him as Agatocle except that he was deceived by Cesare Borgia, who at Sinigaglia, as mentioned previously, captured the Orsini and Vitelli, and where a year after committing patricide, Oliverotto himself, along with Vitellozzo, a mask of virtue and wickedness also, was strangled. One can certainly question why Agatocle and such persons, after betraying everybody and exercising great cruelty, can live a long life sure at home and safe from external enemies, and why the citizens don't conspire against them � whereas others almost as cruel have not been able to maintain states even in peaceful times and certainly not in times of
