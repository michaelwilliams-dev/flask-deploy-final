he said, "so that Socrates can get away with his usual trick; he'll not answer himself, and when someone else has answered he gets hold of the argument and refutes it." "You best of men," I said, "how could a man answer who, in the first place, does not know and does not profess to know; and who, in the second place, even if he does have some supposition about these things, is forbidden to say what he believes by no ordinary man? It's, more fitting for you to speak; for you are the one who says he knows and can tell. Now do as I say; gratify me by answering and don't be? grudge your teaching to Glaucon here and the others." After I said this, Glaucon and the others begged him to do as I said. And Thrasymachus evidently desired to speak so that he could win a good reputation, since he believed he had a very fine answer. But he kept up the preten e of wanting to prevail on me to do the answer? ing. Finally, however, he conceded and then said: "Here is the wisdom of Socrates; unwilling himself to teach, he goes around learning from others, and does not even give thanks to them." "When you say I learn from others," I said, "you speak the truth, . Thrasymachus; but when you say I do not make full payment in_ thanks, you lie. For I pay as much as I can. I am only able to praise. I have no money. How eagerly I do so when I think someone speaks well, you will well know as soon as you have answered; for I suppose you will speak well." "Now listen," he said. "I say that the just is nothing other than the advantage of the stronger.32 Well, why don't you praise me? But you won't be wilJing." "First I must learn what you mean," I said. "For, as it is, I don't yet understand. You say the just is the advantage of the stronger. What ever do you mean by that, Thrasymachus? You surely don't assert such a thing as this: if Polydamas, the par.cratiast,33 is stronger than we are 337. d e 337. a b C [ 15 1 338d e 339a b C and beef isï¿½ advantageous for his body, then this food is also ad? vantageous and just for us who are weaker than he is." "You are disgusting, Socrates," he said. "You take hold of the argument in the way you can work it the most hann." . "Not at all, best of men," I said. "Just tell me more clearly what you mean." "Don't you know," he said, "that some cities are ruled tyrannical- ly, some democratically, and some aristocratically?" "Of course." "In each city, isn't the ruling group master?" "Certainly." "And each ruling group sets down laws for its own advantage; a democracy sets down democratic laws; a tyranny, tyrannic laws; and the others do the same.
