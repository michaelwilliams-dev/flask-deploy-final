OBSERVANCE OFTHE LAW Inthelatefifteenth century,thestrongest city~statesinItaly-——Venice,Flo- rence, Rome, and Milan~—-found themselves constantly squabbling.Hover- ingabove their struggleswere thenations ofFrance andSpain, readyto grabwhatevertheycould from theweakened Italianpowers. And trapped inthemiddle was thesmall state ofMantua, ruled bytheyoungDuke Gianfrancesco Gonzaga.Mantua was strategicallylocated innorthern Italy,and itseemed onlyamatter oftime before oneofthepowers swal- lowed itupand itceased toexist asanindependent kingdom. Gonzagawas afierce warrior and askilled commander oftroops,and hebecame akind ofmercenzuy general forwhatever sidepaidhim best. In theyear 1490, hemarried Isabella d’Este, daughteroftheruler ofanother small Italian duchy,Ferrara. Since henow spentmost ofhistime away iron Mantua, itfelltoIsabella torule inhisstead. lsabellzfs first true test asruler came in1498, when KingLouis XII of France waspreparingarmies toattack Milan. Intheir usual perfidiousfash« ion, theItalian states immediatelylooked forwaystoprofitfrom Mila.n’s difficulties. PopeAlexander VIpromisednot tointervene, thereby giving theFrench carte blanche. The Venefians signaledthattheywould nothelp Milan, either—and inexchangeforthis,they hoped theFrench would give them Mantua. The ruler ofMilan, Lodovico Sforza, suddenlyfound him- selfalone and abandoned. Heturned toIsabella d’Este, one ofhisclosest friends (also rumored tobehislover), andbeggedher topersuadeDuke Gonzaga tocome tohisaid. Isabella tried, butherhusband balked, forhe saw Sforza’s cause ashopeless. And so,in1499, Louis swoopeddown on Milan andtook itwith ease. Isabella now faced adilemma: Ifshestayed loyaltoLodovico, the French would now move against her. Butif,instead, sheallied herself with France, shewould make enemies elsewhere inItaly, compromisingMan- tua once Louis eventuallywithdrew. And ifshelooked toVenice orRome forhelp, theywould simplyswallow upMantua under thecloak ofcoming toher aid. Yet shehad todosomething.Themighty king ofFrance was breathing down her neck: She decided tobefxiend him, asshehad be~ friended Lodovico Sforza before him——-with alluring gifts, witty, intelligent letters, and thepossibilityofhercompany,forIsabella was famous asa woman ofincomparable beautyand charm. In1500 Louis invited Isabella toagreat partyinMilan tocelebrate his victory.Leonardo daVinci built anenormous mechanical lion forthe af- fair:When thelionopened itsmouth, itspewed fresh lilies, thesymbols of French royalty.AtthepartyIsabella wore one ofher celebrated dresses (shehadbyfarthelargest wardrobe ofanyoftheItalian princesses),and justasshehadhoped, shecharmed andcaptivated Louis, who ignoredall theother ladies vyingforhisattention. She soon became hisconstant com- panion,and inexchangeforherfriendshiphepledgedtoprotectMantua’s independence from Venice. As onedanger receded, however, another, more worryingone arose, this time from thesouth, intheform ofCesare Borgia Startingin1500, Borgiahad marched steadily northward, gobbling upallthesmall king- doms inhispathinthe name ofhisfather, Pope Alexander. Isabella under» stood Cesare perfectly:He could beneither tnisted 1101' inany way offended. Hehad tobecajoledandkeptatarm’s length. Isabella began by sending him gifts——falcons, prize dogs, perfumes,and dozens ofmasks, which sheknew healwayswore when hewalked the streets ofRome. She sentmessengers with flattering greetings (althoughthese messengers also acted asherspies). At onepoint Cesare asked ifhecould house some troopsinMantua; Isabella managedtodissuade himpolitely, knowingfull well that once thetroopswere quarteredinthecity, theywould never leave. Even while Isabella wascharming Cesare, she convincedeveryone around her totake care never toutter aharsh word about him, since he had spies everywhere and would use theslightest pretextforinvasion. When Isabella had achild, sheasked Cesare tobethegodfather.She even dangledinfront ofhim thepossibilityofamarriagebetween herfamily and his. Somehow itallworked, foralthoughelsewhere heseized every- thinginhispath,hesparedMantua. In1503 Cesare’s father, Alexander, died, and afewyearslater the new pope, Julius II,went towar todrive theFrench troops from Italy. When theruler ofFe1rara——Alfonso, Isabella’s brother—sided with theFrench, Juliusdecided toattack andhumble him. Once againIsabella found herself inthemiddle: thepopeon one side, theFrench and herbrother onthe other. She dared
