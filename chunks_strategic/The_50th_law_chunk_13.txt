hard life of these streets is a blessing if you know what you�re doing. Because it is such a dangerous world, a hustler has to focus intensely on what�s going on around him. He has to get a feel for the streets�who�s trouble, where there might be some new opportunity. He has to see through all the bullshit people throw at him�their games, their lousy ideas. He has to look at himself, see his own limitations and stupidity. All of this sharpens the eye to a razor�s edge, making him a keen observer of everything. That�s his power. The greatest danger we face, he told Curtis, is not the police or some nasty rival. It�s the mind going soft. I�ve seen it happen to many a hustler, he said. If things go well, he starts thinking it will go on forever and he takes his eyes off the streets. If things go bad, he starts wishing it were all different and he comes up with some foolish scheme to get quick, easy money. Either way, he falls fast. Lose your grip on reality on these streets and you might as well kill yourself. In the months to come, Curtis thought more and more about what Truth had told him, and it began to sink in. He decided to transform the hustler�s words into a kind of code that he would live by: he would trust no one; he would conceal his intentions, even from friends and partners; and no matter how high or low life brought him, he would remain the supreme realist, keeping his hustler�s eye sharp and focused. Over the next few years he became one of the savviest hustlers in his neighborhood, operating a small crew that brought him good money. The future looked promising, but a moment�s inattention got him trapped in a police sting, and at the age of sixteen he was sentenced to nine months in a shock rehabilitation center in upstate New York. In this unfamiliar space and with time to reflect, suddenly the words of Truth came back to him. This was not the time to get depressed or to dream, but to fix that hustler�s eye on himself and the world he lived in. See it as it is, no matter how ugly. He had unbridled ambition; he wanted real power, something he could build on. But no street hustler lasts that long. It�s a young man�s game. By the time hustlers reach their twenties, they slow down and something bad happens or they go scurrying into a low-paying job. And what blinds them to this reality is the money and lifestyle in the moment; they think it will go on forever. They�re too afraid to try something else. It doesn�t matter how clever you are�there�s a ceiling to how high you can rise. He had to wake up and get out while he was still young and his ambitions could be realized. He would not be afraid.
