Atthecastle ofjaviachemet and fellinlove with thebeautiful lady ofthehouse, Madame Guillelma dejaviac.Hesang herhissongs,recited hispoetry, playedchess with her, and little bylittle sheinturn fellinlove with him. Guillaume had afriend, SirPierre deBar jac,who traveled with him and who was also received atthe castle. And Pierre toofellinlove with aladyinjaviac,thegraciousbuttemperamental Viemetta. Then onedayPierre and Viernetta had aviolent quarrel.The lady dismissed him, and hesought out hisfriend Guillaume tohelpheal the breach andgethim back inhergood graces. Guillaume was about toleave thecastle for awhile, but onhisreturn, several weeks later, heworked his magic,and Pierre and theladywere reconciled. Pierre feltthat hislove had increased tenfold—that there was nostronger love, infact, than the love that follows reconciliation. The strongerandlongerthedisagreement, hetold Guillaume, the sweeter thefeelingthat comes withpeaceand rapprochement, As atroubadour, SirGuillaume prided himself onexperiencingallthe joysand sorrows oflove. Onhearing hisfriend's talk, hetoowanted know thebliss ofreconciliation after aquarrel. Hetherefore feigned great anger withLady Guillelma, stopped sendingherlove letters. andabruptly leftthe castle andstayed away,even during thefestivals and hunts. This drove the young ladywild. Guillelma sentmessengerstoGuillaume tofind outwhat bad hair» pened,butheturned themessengers away. Hethoughtallthiswould make herangry, forcing him topleadforreconciliation asPierre had. Instead, however, hisabsence had theoppositeeffect: Itmade Guillelma love him allthe more. Now thelady pursuedherknight, sending messengersand love notes ofher own. This was almost unheard of-—-a ladynever pursued her troubadour. And Guillaume did notlike it.Guillelma’s forwardness made him feel shehad lost some ofherdignity.Notonlywas henolonger sure ofhisplan,hewas nolongersure ofhislady. Finally,after several months ofnothearing from Guillaume, Guillelma gave up.She sent him nomore messengers, andhebegantowonder-per- hapsshe wasangry? Perhapstheplan had worked after all? Somuch the better ifshe was. Hewould wait nomore.-it was time toreconcile. Sohe putonhisbest robe, decked thehorse initsfanciest caparison, chose a magnificent helmet, and rode ofi"tojaviac. Onhearing that herbeloved had returned, Guillelma rushed tosee him, knelt before him, droppedherveil tokisshim, andbegged forgive- ness forwhatever slighthad caused hisanger. Imaginehisconfusion and despairw-his planhad failed abysmally.She was notangry, shehad never beenangry,she wasonly deeperinlove, and hewould never experience thejoyofreconciliation after aquarrel. Seeingher now, andstilldesperate totaste thatjoy,hedecided totryone more time: Hedrove heraway with harsh words andthreatening gestures.Sheleft, this time vowingnever to seehim again. The next morningthetroubadour regretted what hehad done. He rode back tojaviac, butthelady would not receive him, and ordered her servants tochase himaway,across thedrawbridge and over thehill. Guil- laume fled. Back inhischamber hecollapsedand started tocry:Hehad made aterrible mistake. Over thenextyear,unable toseehislady,heex- perienced theabsence, theterrible absence, that canonly inflame love. He wrote oneofhismost beautiful poems, “My songascends formercy pray- ing.”And hesentmanyletters toGuillelma, explaining what hehaddone, andbegging forgiveness. After agreat deal ofthis,Lady Guillelma, rememberinghisbeautiful songs,hishandsome figure,and hisskills indancingandfalconry, found herself yearning tohave him back. Aspenance forhiscruelty,sheordered him toremove thenailfrom thelittle finger ofhisright hand, and tosend it toheralong with apoem describinghismiseries. Hedid assheasked. Finally Guillaume deBalaun was able totaste the ultimate sensation—-a reconciliation even surpassingthat ofhisfriend Pierre. Interpretation Trying todiscover thejoysofreconciliation, Guillaume deBalaun inadver— tently experienced thetruth ofthelaw
