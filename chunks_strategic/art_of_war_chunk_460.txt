you are careful of your men, 1. CHAPTER 10. THE ARMY ON THE MARCH 78 [Ts�ao Kung says: "Make for fresh water and pasture, where you can turn out your animals to graze."] and camp on hard ground, the army will be free from disease of every kind, [Chang Yu says: "The dryness of the climate will prevent the outbreak of illness."] and this will spell victory. 13. When you come to a hill or a bank, occupy the sunny side, with the slope on your right rear. Thus you will at once act for the benefit of your soldiers and utilize the natural advantages of the ground. 14. When, in consequence of heavy rains up-country, a river which you wish to ford is swollen and flecked with foam, you must wait until it subsides. 15. Country in which there are precipitous cliffs with torrents running between, deep natural hollows, [The latter defined as "places enclosed on every side by steep banks, with pools of water at the bottom.] confined places, [Defined as "natural pens or prisons" or "places surrounded by precipices on three sides�easy to get into, but hard to get out of."] tangled thickets, [Defined as "places covered with such dense undergrowth that spears can- not be used."] quagmires [Defined as "low-lying places, so heavy with mud as to be impassable for chariots and horsemen."] and crevasses, [Defined by Mei Yao-ch�en as "a narrow difficult way between beetling cliffs." Tu Mu�s note is "ground covered with trees and rocks, and inter- sected by numerous ravines and pitfalls." This is very vague, but Chia Lin explains it clearly enough as a defile or narrow pass, and Chang Yu takes much the same view. On the whole, the weight of the commentators cer- tainly inclines to the rendering "defile." But the ordinary meaning of the Chinese in one place is "a crack or fissure" and the fact that the meaning of the Chinese elsewhere in the sentence indicates something in the nature of a defile, make me think that Sun Tzu is here speaking of crevasses.] CHAPTER 10. THE ARMY ON THE MARCH 79 should be left with all possible speed and not approached. 16. While we keep away from such places, we should get the enemy to ap- proach them; while we face them, we should let the enemy have them on his rear. 17. If in the neighborhood of your camp there should be any hilly country, ponds surrounded by aquatic grass, hollow basins filled with reeds, or woods with thick undergrowth, they must be carefully routed out and searched; for these are places where men in ambush or insidious spies are likely to be lurking. [Chang Yu has the note: "We must also be on our guard against traitors who may lie in close covert, secretly spying out our weaknesses and over- hearing our instructions."] 18. When the enemy is close at hand and remains quiet, he is relying on the natural strength of his position. [Here
