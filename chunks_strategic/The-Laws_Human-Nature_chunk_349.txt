increasingly common. Such cynicism involves some or all of the following beliefs: Life is absurd, meaningless, and random. Standards of truth, excellence, or meaning are completely old-fashioned. Everything is relative. People�s judgments are simply interpretations of the world, none better than another. All politicians are corrupt, so it�s not really worth it to get involved; better to abstain or choose a leader who will deliberately tear it all down. People who are successful get there through gaming the system. Any form of authority should be naturally mistrusted. Look behind people�s motives and you will see that they are selfish. Reality is quite brutal and ugly; better to accept this and be skeptical. It�s really hard to take anything so seriously; we should just laugh and have a good time. It�s all the same.

If people are deprived of the immeasurably great, they will not live and will die in despair. The immeasurable and infinite are as necessary for man as the small planet he inhabits. �Fyodor Dostoyevsky 14 Resist the Downward Pull of the Group The Law of Conformity W e have a side to our character that we are generally unaware of �our social personality, the different person we become when we operate in groups of people. In the group setting, we unconsciously imitate what others are saying and doing. We think differently, more concerned with fitting in and believing what others believe. We feel different emotions, infected by the group mood. We are more prone to taking risks, to acting irrationally, because everyone else is. This social personality can come to dominate who we are. Listening so much to others and conforming our behavior to them, we slowly lose
