rapidity in bringing it to a close. Only two commentators seem to favor this interpretation, but it fits well into the logic of the context, whereas the rendering, "He who does not know the evils of war cannot appreciate its benefits," is distinctly pointless.] CHAPTER 3. WAGING WAR 35 8. The skillful soldier does not raise a second levy, neither are his supply- wagons loaded more than twice. [Once war is declared, he will not waste precious time in waiting for rein- forcements, nor will he return his army back for fresh supplies, but crosses the enemy�s frontier without delay. This may seem an audacious policy to recommend, but with all great strategists, from Julius Caesar to Napoleon Bonaparte, the value of time � that is, being a little ahead of your oppon- ent � has counted for more than either numerical superiority or the nicest calculations with regard to commissariat.] 9. Bring war material with you from home, but forage on the enemy. Thus the army will have food enough for its needs. [The Chinese word translated here as "war material" literally means "things to be used", and is meant in the widest sense. It includes all the impedi- menta of an army, apart from provisions.] 10. Poverty of the State exchequer causes an army to be maintained by con- tributions from a distance. Contributing to maintain an army at a distance causes the people to be impoverished. [The beginning of this sentence does not balance properly with the next, though obviously intended to do so. The arrangement, moreover, is so awkward that I cannot help suspecting some corruption in the text. It never seems to occur to Chinese commentators that an emendation may be ne- cessary for the sense, and we get no help from them there. The Chinese words Sun Tzu used to indicate the cause of the people�s impoverishment clearly have reference to some system by which the husbandmen sent their contributions of corn to the army direct. But why should it fall on them to maintain an army in this way, except because the State or Government is too poor to do so?] 11. On the other hand, the proximity of an army causes prices to go up; and high prices cause the people�s substance to be drained away. [Wang Hsi says high prices occur before the army has left its own territory. Ts�ao Kung understands it of an army that has already crossed the frontier.] 12. When their substance is drained away, the peasantry will be afflicted by heavy exactions. 13. ,14. With this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength, the homes of the people will be stripped bare, and three-tenths of their income will be dis- sipated; [Tu Mu and Wang Hsi agree that the people are not mulcted not of 3/10, but of 7/10, of their income. But this is hardly to be extracted from our text. Ho Shih has a characteristic tag: "The PEOPLE being regarded as CHAPTER 3. WAGING
