and providing for the advantage of each?" "Yes, that is what it is directed toward." "And is there then any advantage for each of the arts other than to be as perfect as possible?" "How do you mean this question?" "Just as," I said, "if you should ask me whether it's enough for a body to be a body or whether it needs something else, I would say: 'By all means, it needs something else. And the art of medkine has now been discovered because a body is defective,36 and it won't do for it to be like that. The art was devised for the purpose of providing what is advantageous for a body.' Would I seem to you to speak correctly in saying that or not?" "You would," he said. "And what about medicine itself, is it or any other art defective, and does it need some supplementary virtue? Just as eyes need sight and ears hearing and for this reason an art is needed that will consider and provide what is advantageous for them, is it also the case that there 341 b 342 337. a is some defect in the art itself and does each art have need of another art that considers its advantage, and does the art that considers it need in its tum another of the same kind, and so on endlessly? Or does each b. consider its own advantage by itself? Or does it need neither itself nor another to consider what is advantag�eous for its defect? ls it that there is no defect or error present in any art, and that it isn't fitting for an art to seek the advantage of anything else than that of which it is the art, and that it is itself without blemish or taint because it is correct so long as it is precisely and wholly what it is? And consider this in that precise sense. Is it so or otherwise?" "That's the way it looks," he said. b. "Then," I said, "medicine doesn't consider the advantage of medicine, but of the body." "Yes," he said. "Nor does horsemanship consider the advantage of horsemanship, but of horses. Nor does any other art consider its own advantage-for it doesn't have any further need to-but the advantage of that of which it is the art." "It looks that way," he said. "But, Thrasymachus, the arts rule and -are masters of that of which they are arts." He conceded this too, but with a great deal of resistance. "Then, there is no kind of knowledge that considers or commands the advantage of the stronger, but rather of what is weaker and ruled by b. it." He finally agreed to this, too, although he tried to put up a fight about it. When he had agreed, I said: � "Then, isn't it the case that the doctor, insofar as he is a doctor, considers or commands not the doctor's advantage,.but that of the sick man? For the doctor in
