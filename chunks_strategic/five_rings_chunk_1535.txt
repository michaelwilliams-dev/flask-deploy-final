Instead of being executed orexiled faraway,hehad been sent totheisland ofElba, notfarfrom the coast ofItaly. Even imprisonedon anisland, aman asbold and creative as Napoleon Bonapartemadeeveryonenervous. The Austrians plottedtokill him onElba, butdecided itwas toorisky. Alexander I,Rnssia’s tempera» mental czar, heightenedtheanxiety bythrowinga{itduringthecongress when apartofPoland was denied him: “Beware, Ishall loose the mon- ster!" hethreatened. Everyoneknew hemeant Napoleon. Ofallthestates men gatheredinVienna, only Talleyrand, Napoleon’s former foreign minister, seemed calm and unconcerned. Itwas asifheknew something theothers didnot. Meanwhile, ontheisland ofElba, Napoleon's life was amockery ofhis previous glory.AsElba’s “king,”hehad been allowed toform acourt-— there was acook, awardrobe mistress, anofficial pianist,and a.handful of courtiers. Allthis wasdesigned tohumiliate Napoleon, and itseemed to work. That winter, however, there occurred a.series ofevents sostrange and dramatic theymighthave been scriptedinaplay.Elba was surrounded by British ships,their cannons covering allpossibleexitpoints. Yetsomehow, inbroad daylighton26February 1815, aship with nine hundred men on board picked upNapoleon andputtoseaTheEnglish gavechase butthe ship got away. This almost impossible escapeastonished thepublic throughout Europe,and terrified thestatesmen attheCongress ofVienna. Althoughitwould have been safer toleave Europe, Napoleonnotonly chose toreturn toFrance, heraised theodds bymarchingonParis with a tinyarmy,inhopes ofrecapturingthethrone. Hisstrategy worked——people ofallclasses threw themselves athisfeet. Anarmyunder Marshal Neysped from Paris toarrest him, butwhen thesoldiers saw their beloved former leader, they changedsides. Napoleonwas declared emperor again. Volun- teers swelled theranks ofhisnewarmy.Delirium sweptthecountry. InParis, crowds went wild. Theking who hadreplaced Napoleonfled thecountry. Forthenext hundred days, Napoleonruled France. Soon, however, the giddinesssubsided. France wasbankrupt,itsresources nearly exhausted, andthere waslittle Napoleon could doabout this. AttheBattle ofWaterloo, injuneofthatyear,hewasfinally defeated forgood.This time hisenemies hadlearned their lesson: Theyexiled him tothebarren island ofSaint I-Ie~ lena, offthe west coast ofAfrica. There hehad nomore hope ofescape. Interpretation Only yearslater did the facts ofNapoleon'sdramatic escape from Elba come tolight. Before hedecided toattempt thisbold move, visitors tohis court hadtoldhim that hewas more popularinFrance than ever, and that LAW 8 63 M LAW 8thecountrywould embrace him again.One ofthese visitors was Austria’s General Keller, who convinced Napoleonthatifheescaped,theEuropean powers, England included, would welcome him back into power. Napoleon wastippedoffthat theEnglish would lethim go,and indeed hisescapeoc- curred inthemiddle oftheafternoon, infullview ofEnglish spyglasses. What Napoleon didnotknow was that there was aman behind itall, pullingthestrings,and that this man was hisformer minister, Talleyrand. And Talleyrandwasdoingallthis not tobringback theglory days but to crush Napoleononce andforall.Considering theemperor’sambition un- settlingtoEurope’s stability,hehad turned against himlong ago. When Napoleonwas exiled toElba, Talleyrandhadprotested. Napoleonshould besent fartheraway, heargued,orEuropewould never have peace. But noone Listened. Instead ofpushinghisopinion, Talleyrandbided histime. Working quietly,heeventuallywon over Castlereaghand Metternich, theforeign ministers ofEngland and Austria.
