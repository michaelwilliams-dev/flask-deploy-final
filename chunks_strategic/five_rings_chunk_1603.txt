He was theking’s architect from then on. Interpretation As ayoung man, Mansart had seen howmany royalcraftsmen inthe sen vice ofLouis XIV had losttheir positions notthroughalack oftalent but throughacostlysocial blunder. Hewould notmake that mistake. Mansart alwaysstrove tomake Louis feel better about himself, tofeed theking’s vanityaspubliclyaspossible. Never imagine that skill and talent areallthat matter. Incourt the courtier’s artismore importantthan histalent; never spendsomuch time onyourstudies thatyouneglect your social skills. And thegreatest skill of allistheabilitytomake the master look more talented than those around him. Scene IV Jean-Baptiste Isabeyhad become theunofficial painteroftheNapoleonic court.

When Isabeyarrived inVienna, Talleyrand,themain negotiatorfor theFrench, paidtheartist avisit. Consideringhisrole intheproceedings, the statesman explained,heexpectedtooccupycenter stageinthepaint- ing.Isabey cordially agreed. Afewdayslater theDuke ofWellington,the main negotiator fortheEnglish, also approached Isabey, and said much the same thingthatTalleyrand had. The everpolite Isabey agreedthat the greatduke should indeedhethe center ofattention. Back inhisstudio, Isabey ponderedthedilemma. Ifhegavethespot- lighttoeither ofthetwo men, hecould create adiplomatic rift,stirring up allsorts ofresentment atatime whenpeaceand concord were critical. When thepaintingwasfinally unveiled, however, both Talleyrandand Wellingtonfelthonored and satisfied.

Such predicamentsare comw mon inthelifeofacourtier: Bygiving attention toone master, hedis- pleases another. You must find awaytonavigate thisScyllaandCharybdis safely.

Scene V George Brummell, also known asBeau Brummell, made hismark inthe late 1700s bythesupreme elegance ofhisappearance,hispopularization of shoe buckles (soon imitated byallthedandies). and hiscleverway with words.

One ofBrummell’s greatestadmirers was thePrince ofWales, who fancied himself afashionable youngman. Becoming attached tothe prince’scourt (and provided with aroyal pension),Brummell was soon so sureofhis‘ own authoritythere that hetook tojokingabout theprince’s weight, referringtohishost asBigBen. Since trimness offigurewas anim~ portant qualityfor a.dandy,this was awitheringcriticism. Atdinner once, when the service was slow, Brummell said totheprince,“Doting, Big Ben” Theprince rang,butwhen thevalet arrived heordered the man to show Brummell thedoor and never admit him again. Despite fallinginto theprince’s disfavor, Brummell continued totreat everyonearound him with the same arrogance. Without the Prince of Wales’ patronagetosupport him, hesank into horrible debt, buthemain tained hisinsolent manners, andeveryonesoon abandoned him.
