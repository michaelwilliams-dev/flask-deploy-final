not plan first, hoping to rely on your strength, your victory is uncertain. JIA LIN If you set forth your battle lines and lightly advance without knowing your own condition or that of your opponent, you may be seeking victory, but in the end you defeat yourself. Master Sun Those who use arms well cultivate the Way and keep the rules. Thus they can govern in such a way as to prevail over the corrupt. CAO CAO Skilled users of arms first cultivate the Way that makes them invincible, keep their rules, and do not miss defeatist confusion in opponents. LI QUAN Using harmony to hunt down opposition, not attacking a blameless country, not taking captives or booty wherever the army goes, not razing the trees or polluting the wells, washing off and purifying the shrines of the towns and hills in the countryside you pass through, not repeating the mistakes of a moribund nation�all this is called the Way and its rules. When the army is strictly disciplined, to the point where soldiers would die rather than disobey, rewards and punishments that are trustworthy and just are established�when the military leadership is such that it can achieve this, it can prevail over an opponent�s corrupt civil government. Master Sun The rules of the military are five: measurement, assessment, calculation, comparison, and victory. The ground gives rise to measurements, measurements give rise to assessments, assessments give rise to calculations, calculations give rise to comparisons, comparisons give rise to victories. CAO CAO By the comparisons of measurements you know where victory and defeat lie. WANG XI The heavy prevail over the light.

Skillful warriors are able to allow the force of momentum to seize victory for them without exerting their strength. Master Sun Governing a large number as though governing a small number is a matter of division into groups. Battling a large number as though battling a small number is a matter of forms and calls. CAO CAO Forms and calls refer to the formations and signals used to dispose troops and coordinate movements. Master Sun Making the armies able to take on opponents without being defeated is a matter of unorthodox and orthodox methods. JIA LIN When you meet opponents head on, with coordinated surprise attacks all around, you can always win and never lose. HO YANXI A military body goes
