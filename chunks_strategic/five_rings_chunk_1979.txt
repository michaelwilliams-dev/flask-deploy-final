thatjustice ismost useful and in- dispensable intheaffairs ofwar,and, inpeacetime, inkeeping money deposits. Thisresponse ismore helpful forlearning about Polemarchus' [319 ] THEREPUBLIC view ofjustice than forsolving theproblem ofjustice's subject matter. Theconnection ofwarandmoney isobvious; andthekind ofgood things Polemarchus means andthesense inwhich thejustcitizen isa warrior emerge more clearly. But, ashedoes intheother cases, Soc- rates could easily show thataskilled soldier isabetter partner inwar than ajustman,andatrained banker abetter partner inpeacetime than ajustman. Socrates hasindicated bytheexamples heuses that, forPolemarchus atleast, justice isconcerned with theacquisition and distribution ofgood things incommunities ofmenwhile keeping off theoutsiders (332c-d, 333a, 333b). The extraordinary result ofthis conversation isthatjustice isuseless intheenterprise ofdoing good to friends andharm toenemies. What hashappened isthatSocrates and Polemarchus discover thattheworld isdivided upamong theartsand there isnothing leftforanartofjustice. Adoctor maydogood tohis friends andhence bejust,butjustice isnothing beyond theexercise of hisart,which issomething other than justice. Arts arethemeans of doing goodandharm; artshave subject matters butjustice does not; hence justice isnotanartandcannot dogood. Justice hasdisappeared. Moreover, Socrates insists onpointing outthat the arts are neutral, thattheycaneffect opposite results withequal ease. This fact isparticularly shocking toPolemarchus, for itsconsequence isthatthe practitioner oftheartofjustice would beasadept atstealing asat guarding athing andwould lieaswell ashetellsthetruth. Nothing in theartwould guide aman astowhich heshould do;hewould merely betechnically proficient. Instead ofbeing themodel ofreliability, the justmanbecomes thearchetype ofuntrustworthiness, thepossessor of power without guiding principle. He isathiefandaliar,thecontrary ofthedebt-paying, truth-telling justmandefined byPolemarchus' father —adefinition which Polemarchus hasinherited andthesubstance of which heistrying todefend. Ofcourse, ithasbeen admitted that thejustmansometimes would notpayhisdebts andwould lieeven tohisfriends, sotheresult ofthisargument should notbesurprising. ButPolemarchus isun- willing toaccept it.He isagentleman, andthere arecertain things— dishonorable things— agentleman isnever supposed todo.Hemay admit thattheymustbedone, andevendothem, butherefuses torec- ognize theconsequences ofwhathedoes. Ifhedidso, itwould seem toend inthelossofallstandards. Life isordered according tofixed rules, andtheexceptions arehidden insilence. Polemarchus could be accused ofhypocrisy, andthelimitations ofhiskind ofmoralism are exposed here. Socrates hints thatthegood things which Polemarchus defends might wellhavebeen acquired inlessthandecent ways, the [320 ] Interpretive Essay memory ofwhich islostinthemists oftime. But,even worse, his character issuch thathewould probably rather workharm thanuse ungentlemanly means toagood end. Socrates, astheRepublic reveals, isnotaverse toliesand iscertainly norespecter ofprivate property. However thatmay be,theassumption that justice isanartdoes lead toserious difficulties, expressed ironically inthenotion thatthe justman isboth useless andathief. Itwould seem that artsrequire par- ticular subject matters andthattheyaremorally neutral.Weareforced toabandon theassumption, andonemight very wellaskwhy itwas made inthefirstplace.We allsense thatjustice isadisposition, asCeph- alus originally suggested, onewhich everymanmust possess inaddi- tion tohisskill .Adoctor mustbedisposed toheal liispatients aswell asbeable todoso;otherwise hemight justaswell killthem forprofit ascurethem. JustwhydidSocrates turntheconversation inthisdirec- tion? Inthe firstplace, itmustberemembered that,with thebanish- ment ofCephalus, ancestral authority wasreplaced bywhatmencan know forthemselves, bytheevidence ofreasoned experience. The arts arethemostobvious sources ofknowledge available toallmen asmen without theneed ofanyactoffaith ortheinstruction ofaparticular tradition. Thedesire toknowwhatoneowes othermenwould most im- mediately lead inthedirection oftrying todiscern anartwhich can guide usjust asmedicine guides usinmatters ofhealth. Moreover, however much habitmayplay arole inthecharacter wecalljust, itis alsoclear that itissimply insufficient foraman tofollow ruleswithout anyknowledge ofthereasons behind them. Cephalus isproof enough ofthat.Ourdoctors aresupposed toobey theHippocratic oath,and thatobedience would, inasense,makethem reliable. But, ultimately, themostimportant thing istheknowledge ofthegoodness ofthatoath, ofthereasons why following itissalutary. Theworthwhileness ofa doctor's activity depends onthis;and,nomatter how technically profi- cient hemay be,histalents areuseless ordangerous ifthere isno knowledge about
