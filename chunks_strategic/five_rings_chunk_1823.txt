not advance footnotes ,glossary ,biography ,historical references , bibliography ,orother academic apparatus .All this can bereadily at- tained from the encyclopedias and inthe numerous tortuous educated and scholarly translations available from Harvard ,Oxford ,Cambridge and elsewhere .The text here isaimed atthe common man with read- ability and plainness for those who simply want toread The Prince for what Machiavelli may have had tosay about the human condition read President for Prince ,orchicanery for virtue ,orEstablishment for Bloodline ,orhowever you will .― AstoMachiavelli himself ,hewas amaverick ,with anacute mind . He was acerbic ,ironic ,and double -edged .Nietzsche said that Machia- velli wrote with "agalloping rhythm ,”that hehad his tongue inhis cheek sometimes ,and that hedealt with change inthe consciousness paradigm ofthe Renaissance when man began tothink innew ways about himself and the world around him . The key toMachiavelli ishis concept of“effective reality ,”rather than idealized ,philosophical ,or“ethical reality .” His final plea tofree Italy from the barbarian and tounite the land and people came true only later ,inthe 19th century ,under Garibaldi ; but,itwas the issue hewas already speaking to. Personally ,Imay not always agree with Machiavelli - although almost always Irespect his counsel .Aruler ,hesays ,should never think 140— Niccolò Machiavelli orpractice anything butwar, weapons, andmilitary exercises. Even a modern President hascome farfrom thisancient andrudimentary phi- losophy, practicing diplomacy, administration, andcivic virtues. For Machiavelli, aPrince scorns thegentle arts—yeteven such asFreder- ickIIofSicily played theflute, danced, andcultivated thearts. Times mayhave changed; wemaybe,oralmost, inapost-bellum world, ifnot apost military world. War may almost beold-fashioned. Iwould it were so.Machiavelli warned against such Pollyanna. And nations still maintain themilitary anddefense posture astheir number oneoption. Machiavelli isalways therealist and almost always theclear thinker. Thecenterpiece ofhisphilosophy isinChapter XVII where he shows unequivocally thatasuccessful Prince should prefer tobefeared than loved. ThetextofThePrince isstillasrelevant today tosocial affairs asit wasin1532, although now thePrince isreplaced intitlebyapresident, prime minister, premier, ordictator. Therules areoften thesame, al- though thedemocratic means ofcoming topower arechanged and tempered. Thepsychological, social, andpolitical dynamics areoften similar, viz.Kissinger, viz.Clinton. Further, ThePrince stillserves as arealistic primer toschool, college, anduniversity civics andpolitical science studies. Because itslanguage anddescription aremore naked and unsophisticated bystatistics, jargon, and nomenclature, itstill serves asaprimary source forthose interested intherawnature ofso- cialaffairs. “But ofallwho thought toconstruct aState, thegreatest beyond all comparison wasMachiavelli,” says Jacob Burckhardt inthegreat clas- sic,TheCivilization OfTheRenaissance InItaly (Basel, 1860 reissued, Phaidon Press, London, 1951, theMiddlemore translation). “He treats existing forces asliving andactive, takes alarge andaccurate view of alternative possibilities, andseeks tomislead neither himself noroth- ers.” Burkchardt also points outunflinchingly that, although Machia- velli wasaminister ofstate, hehimself wasdenied asaprophet byhis own Tuscan country, andhisrealism andmodernism ledhimeventu- allytoruin.
