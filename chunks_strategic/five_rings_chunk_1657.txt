Inplanning your assault, keepthese principlesinmind: Pay Attention toGestures and Unconscious Signals. AsSigmund Freud remarked, “No mortal cankeepatsecret. Ifhislipsaresilent, hechat- terswith hisfingertips; betrayaloozes outofhim atevery pore.”This isa critical conceptinthe search for aperson’sweakness-—it isrevealed by seemingly unimportant gestures andpassingwords. The keyisnotonlywhatyoulook forbutwhere and howyoulook. Everydayconversaiion suppliestherichest mine ofweaknesses, sotrain yourselftolisten. Start byalways seeminginterested——~the appearance ofa sympatheticearwillspur anyonetotalk. Aclever trick, often used bythe nineteenth-centuryFrench statesman Talleyrand,istoappeartoopen upto theotherperson,toshare asecret with them. Itcan becompletelymade up,oritcan bereal but ofnogreat importancetoyou——-the important thingisthat itshould seem tocome from theheart. This willusuallyelicit at responsethat isnotonlyasfrank asyoursbut more genuine»-a response that reveals aweakness. Ifyoususpectthat someone has a.particularsoftspot, probe foritindi» rectly. If,forinstance, yousense that aman has aneed tobeloved, openly flatter him. Ifhelaps upyour compliments,nomatter how obvious, you are ontherighttrack. Train your eye fordetails——how someone tipsa waiter, what delightsaperson, thehidden messagesinclothes. Findpeo- ple-.’s idols, thethings they worshipand will doanythingtoget“-perhaps youcan bethesupplier oftheir fantasies. Remember: Since weallmyto hide ourweaknesses, there islittle tobeleamed from our conscious behav- ior.What oozes outinthelittle thingsoutside our conscious control iswhat youwant toknow. Find theHelpless Child. Most weaknesses begininchildhood, before theselfbuildsupcompensatorydefenses. Perhaps thechild waspampered orindulgedinaparticular area, orperhapsacertain emotional need went unfulfilled; asheorshegrows older, theindulgenceorthedeficiency may beburied but never disappears. Knowingabout achildhood need gives youapowerful keytoaperson’s weakness. One signofthis weakness isthat whenyoutouch onitthepersonwill often actlike achild. Beonthelookout, then, foranybehavior that should have been outgrown.Ifyour victims orrivals went without somethingim- portant, such asparental support, when they were children, supply it,orits facsimile. Iftheyreveal asecret taste, ahidden indulgence, indulgeit.Inei- ther casethey will beunable toresist you. Look for Contrasts. An overt trait often conceals itsopposite. People whothumptheir chests areoften bigcowards;aprudish exterior may hide alascivious soul; theuptightareoften screaming foradventure; theshyare dying forattention. Byprobing beyond appearances, you will often find people’sweaknesses intheopposite ofthequalities they reveal toyou. Find theWeak Link. Sometimes inyour search forweaknesses itisnot what butwho that matters. Intoday’sversions ofthecourt, there isoften someone behind the scenes who has agreatdeal ofpower,atremendous influence over theperson superficiallyontop.
