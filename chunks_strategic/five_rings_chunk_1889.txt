"And this,Glaucon, turns outtobeafter allakind ofphantom of justice—that's alsowhy it'shelpful—thefactthattheshoemaker bynature rightly practices shoemaking anddoes nothing else,andthecarpenter practices carpentry, andsoonfortherest." "Itlooks like it." "But intruth justice was, as itseems, something ofthis sort; however, notwith respect toaman's minding hisexternal business, but with respect towhat iswithin, with respect towhat truly concerns him d and hisown.Hedoesn't leteach part inhimmind other people's business orthethree classes inthesoulmeddle with each other, butreally sets hisownhouse ingood order andrules himself; hear- ranges himself, becomes hisown friend, andharmonizes thethree parts, exactly likethree notes inaharmonic scale, lowest, highest andmiddle.

"All right," Isaid. "Ifweshould assert thatwehave found the justmanand cityandwhat justice really isinthem, Idon't suppose we'dseem tobetelling anutter lie."

"Plainly." b "Mustn't it,initsturn,beacertain faction among those three—a meddling, interference, andrebellion ofapartofthesoul against the whole?

"Certainly," hesaid, "that iswhat they are." c "Then," Isaid, "asforperforming unjust actions andbeing unjust and, again, doing justthings, isn'twhat allofthem arebynow clearly manifest, ifinjustice andjustice arealsomanifest?" "How so?" "Because," Isaid, "they don't differ from thehealthy and the sick;what these areinabody, they areinasoul." "Inwhatway?" hesaid. "Surely healthy things produce health and sickones sickness." "Yes." "Doesn't doing justthings alsoproduce justice andunjust ones in- d justice?" "Necessarily."
