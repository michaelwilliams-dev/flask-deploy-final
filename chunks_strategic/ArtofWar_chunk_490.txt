they were obliged to fight for their lives, but had allowed each man to follow his own discretion, there would have been a general debandade, and it would have been impossible to do anything with them." The officers admitted the force of his argument, and said: "These are higher tactics than we should have been capable of." [See CH�IEN HAN SHU, ch. 34, ff. 4, 5.] ] 1. For it is precisely when a force has fallen into harm�s way that is capable of striking a blow for victory. [Danger has a bracing effect.] 1. Success in warfare is gained by carefully accommodating ourselves to the enemy�s purpose. [Ts�ao Kung says: "Feign stupidity"�by an appearance of yielding and falling in with the enemy�s wishes. Chang Yu�s note makes the meaning clear: "If the enemy shows an inclination to advance, lure him on to do so; if he is anxious to retreat, delay on purpose that he may carry out his intention." The object is to make him remiss and contemptuous before we deliver our attack.] 1. By persistently hanging on the enemy�s flank, [I understand the first four words to mean "accompanying the enemy in one direction." Ts�ao Kung says: "unite the soldiers and make for the enemy."

Be stern in the council-chamber, [Show no weakness, and insist on your plans being ratified by the sover- eign.] so that you may control the situation. [Mei Yao-ch�en understands the whole sentence to mean: Take the strictest precautions to ensure secrecy in your deliberations.] 1. If the enemy leaves a door open, you must rush in. 2. Forestall your opponent by seizing what he holds dear, [Cf. supra, ss. 18.] and subtly contrive to time his arrival on the ground. [Ch�en Hao�s explanation: "If I manage to seize a favorable position, but the enemy does not appear on the scene, the advantage thus obtained can- not be turned to any practical account. He who intends therefore, to occupy a position of importance to the enemy, must begin by making an artful appointment, so to speak, with his antagonist, and cajole him into going there
