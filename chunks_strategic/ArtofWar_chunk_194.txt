out rewards that are not in the rules, give out directives that are not in the code. MEI YAOCHEN Consider the merit to give the reward, without rules set up beforehand; observe the opponent to make promises, without prior setup of codes. JIA LIN When you want to take a citadel and overthrow a nation, you establish punishments and rewards outside your country, and carry out directives outside your government, so you do not stick to your ordinary rules and codes. Master Sun Employ the entire armed forces like employing a single person. Employ them with actual tasks, do not talk to them. Motivate them with benefits, do not tell them about harm.

Both of these are techniques of according with the enemy. ZHANG YU First you go along with their intentions, subsequently you kill their generals� this is skill in accomplishing the task. Master Sun So on the day war is declared, borders are closed, passports are torn up, and emissaries are not let through. ZHANG YU Once top-level assessments have been made and military strategy has been developed, then the borders are sealed and passports are revoked, not letting messengers through, lest there be information leaks. Master Sun Matters are dealt with strictly
