isirreducible andthat itissomehow the principle ofthecosmos. Theshade ofAchilles inHades isoffensive not only togood morals buttothepossibility ofphilosophy, forAchilles seems toshow thatthehuman soulhasnosupport inthecosmos. So- cratic thought combines theapparently contradictory concerns of earlier poetry andearlier philosophy; hecanunderstand manandun- derstand nature, forthetwoareinformed bythesame principle, soul. TheRepublic, which seems togiveacompleted teaching about politics andthesoul,endswith areturn tophilosophic doubt, totheconviction thatone's opinions areopen tounanswered, ifnotunanswerable, ques- tions. Inonesenseonecaneven saythatthebook hastaught usnothing other than thenecessity ofphilosophy and itspriority andsuperiority tothepolitical life. Themyth ofErmerely reiterates thismessage. According tothis myth there isarational cosmic order towhich each individual's fate is attached. Inthe afterlife happiness andmisery aredistributed ac- cording tovirtues andvices practiced during life.Thisencourages de- centmen topersist intheir efforts tobevirtuous; foriftheysucceed, a wonderful thousand-year voyage through theheavens awaits them. But themyth alsomakes clear thatthecivic virtues donotsuffice fora man's salvation for alleternity, and that, unless hehasphilosophized onearth, thisvoyage will profit him nothing. Foreachmanmust choose anew life,andthatnew lifewilldetermine whether hewillfare [435 ] THEREPUBLIC wellorillinhisnextthousand-year sojourn among thedead; thecor- rectchoice ofalifedepends onknowledge ofthesoul, notontheprac- ticeofmoral virtue. Thosewhohavebeenrewarded formoral virtue in theafterlife arelesswellprepared than arethosewhohavebeenpun- ished tomake theproper choice oflife.Weseeadecent man,onelike Cephalus, whohasjustcome from hisrewards, choose atyrant's life; foronlylawandconvention hadkepthim inbounds inhisearlier life, andhisrealview ofhappiness ledhim toenvy tyrants. Hehaslearned nothing intheafterlife; there isapparently nophilosophy intheafter- lifeforthosewhodidnotpractice itonearth; thesoul isnotperfected bytheseparation from thebody. For allmen other than the philosopher, there isaconstant change offortune from happiness to misery andback.Themyth attributes fullresponsibility tomen for what happens tothem andthus teaches that there isnosinbut ignorance. ThekeytoEr'saccount ofhisvisit totheother world istheab- sence ofAchilles.

Achilles nolonger exists, alive ordead, inthenewpoetry orthenewSocratic world. Cor- respondingly, thewisevoyager Odysseus gains higher status. Allhe needed wastobecured ofloveofhonor (aformofspiritedness), andhe could livetheobscure buthappy lifeofSocrates. InthisSocrates alsogets hisinspiration fromHomer, andthusheletsusknow thattheremaybe another side toHomer's poetry than thatwhich thetradition had popularized. Atallevents, theteaching ofthemyth isastrictly human one-man inthis life,without being other worldly—canattain self- sufficient happiness intheexercise ofhisnatural powers andonly in thisway willhepartake ofeternity totheextent ahuman being cando so.Otherwise stated, only thephilosopher hasnoneed ofthemyth. On thisnote thediscussion ends, Glaucon having learned his lesson inmoderation, andSocrates thereby having made hisapology— theapology ofamanwho benefits others because hefirstofallknows how tobenefit himself. [436 ] NOTES NOTES Book I 1."Republic" istheEnglish equivalent ofCicero's Latin translation ofthe Greek title Politeia. Theword doesnotconvey precisely thecorrect connota- tion tous,although thegreatweight ofthetradition hinders usfromchanging theEnglish rendition ofthetitle itself.Theword politeia isultimately derived from polis (bywayofpolites, citizen), asaremany oftheimportant political terms inPlato's vocabulary. The polis isthecity, thecommunity ofmensharing awayoflifeand governing themselves, waging warandpreserving thepeace. ]The polis isthe natural social group, containing allthat isnecessary forthedevelopment and exercise ofthehuman powers.p'oday polis isusually translated as"city-state"; this isdone because itisrecognized thatapolis isnotastate inthemodem sense (forexample, state asdistinguished from society), andthatthecharacter ofancient political lifewas radically different from ourown.However, to translate polis as"city-state" implies thatournotion ofstate issomehow con- tained inthatofthepolis, although only half-consciously. Hencejthe ancient understanding ofpolitical things istaken asanimperfect prefiguration ofthe modem onerather than asanalternative toit—^analternative alienandnot adequately known tous.^In thisedition itwillalways berendered "city," on
