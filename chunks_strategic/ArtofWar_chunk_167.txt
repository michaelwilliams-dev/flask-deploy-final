and make opponents tired without wearing yourself out. Master Sun Therefore good warriors cause others to come to them, and do not go to others. DU MU Causing opponents to come to you, you should conserve your strength and wait for them, not going to opponents for fear of wearing yourself out. ZHANG YU If you make opponents come to fight, then their force will always be empty. If you do not go to fight, then your force will always be full. This is the art of emptying others and filling yourself. Master Sun What causes opponents to come of their own accord is the prospect of gain. What discourages opponents from coming is the prospect of harm. HO YANXI Lure them with something to gain, and opponents will be tired while you are at ease. ZHANG YU The only way to get opponents to come to you is to lure them with gain. The only way to ensure that opponents will not get to you is to harm what they care about. CAO CAO To bring them to you, lure them with gain. To keep them from getting to you, attack where they will be sure to go to the rescue. DU YOU If you can cause them to run while you hold an essential pass, you can make it impossible for opponents to get to you. As it is said, �One cat at the hole, and ten thousand mice dare not come out; one tiger in the valley, and ten thousand deer cannot pass through.� Master Sun So when opponents are at ease, it is possible to tire them. When they are well fed, it is possible to starve them. When they are at rest, it is possible to move them. CAO CAO You cause them trouble with some affair, you cut off their supply routes to starve them, you attack what they like and appear where they will go, thus causing opponents to have to go to the rescue. LI QUAN You attack unexpectedly, causing opponents to become exhausted just running for their lives. You burn their supplies and raze their fields, cutting off their supply routes. You appear at critical places and strike when they least expect it, making them have to go to the rescue. DU MU The arts of starving an opponent do not stop at cutting off supply lines. In the late sixth century, Yuwen Huaji led an armed force to attack Li Mi. Li Mi knew that Huaji was short on supplies, so he feigned conciliation in order to wear out his troops. Huaji was delighted, and fed his soldiers all they wanted, expecting that Li Mi was going to supply them. Subsequently the food ran out, and the generals from Li Mi�s army who had pretended to join up with Huaji went back to Li Mi�s camp with their troops. This finally led to Huaji�s defeat. Master Sun Appear where they cannot go, head for where they least expect you. To
