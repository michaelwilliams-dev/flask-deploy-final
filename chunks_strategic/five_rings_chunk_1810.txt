never toletescape from hislips anything contrary tothese five qualities, seeming always tobe compassionate, faithful, honest, humane, andreligious. Nothing ismore important than toseem tobereligious. Men judge more byappearances than bydeeds. Everyone cansee,fewpeople can actually perceive andjudge. Everybody canseewhat youseem to be;fewcanjudge what youactually are.Those fewdonotdare to oppose themajority, who control thestate that defends them. Men's actions, andthose ofPrinces, have noother tribunal orap- peal. Judgment isfinal. SoaPrince dissimulates towinandmain- tain thestate. Some Princes oftoday, whom itiswell notto name, preach nothing butpeace andgood faith, butdespise both. Had they respected peace andgood faith they would have lost both their reputations andtheir states. IwantHOW ASAPRINCE TOAVOID BEING DESPISED AND HATED have mentioned themost important qualities foraPrince but now tobealittle more specific: how, namely, thePrince should avoid thatwhich makes himhateful orscorned, and how. Ifhedoes this, heshould notworry about hisreputation otherwise. Thefastest waytobecome hated istoberapacious and take theproperty orwomen ofyour subjects. This, thePrince has toavoid. Men lefttotheir possessions andhonor livecontentedly. Alloneneeds then istoguard against theambitions ofafew. Itis easy andthere aremany ways tohinder them. Hemust guard against being lackadaisical, effeminate, andpusillanimous. Ir- resolute. Above allthePrince needs toguard against irresolute- ness. Heshould cultivate greatness, liveliness, gravity, and strength. Inrelations with hissubjects, they should know thathis judgment isirreversible. They should view him insuch away thatnoonedare deceive oraggravate him. APrince who builds thisreputation hasenough. Hebecomes difficult toconspire against, difficult toattack. Heisinstead es- teemed andrevered. APrince must feartwothings: internal dan- gerfrom hissubjects, andthreats from foreign powers. Thebest defense istobewell armed andhave good friends, andwhoever iswell armed will have good friends. Internal security will be good ifthreats from outside areblocked, aslong asthere isnoin- ternal conspiracy. When theattack comes from outside, ifthe Prince hasthings under control internally andlives asIsay,as long ashedoesn't panic hewillbeable toward offevery threat as didNabid theSpartan. When things arepeaceful abroad, thePrince hastobecareful thathissubjects donotplot athome. Ifheavoids hatred and scorn hegoes along way toavoiding this—thepeople willbe 100—Niccolò Machiavelli satisfied with him. Ialready showed how todothis. One ofthe first ways ofavoiding plots istobeloved bythemasses. Those who plotagainst thePrince reckon onpleasing thepopulace. If they areafraid ofoffending thepeople, they nolonger have the courage tofollow thispath, because theobstacles faced bycon- spirators areendless. There have been many plots, butfewhave succeeded. Who plots cannot bealone norcanheseek outanyone except malcontents. Assoon asyoushare asecret with amalcon- tent, yougive himammunition tobecontent because hecangain advantage byinforming. Since heseesanimmediate advantage in informing, hemust either beanawfully good friend orhate the Prince awfully inorder tokeep faith. Inshort, theconspirators have todealwith fear, jealousy, and possible punishment, while onhissidethePrince hasmajesty of thePrincipality, thelaws, hisfriends andestate toprotect him. So much sothatifhejointothispopularity, itisunlikely thatany- onewillplotagainst him. Ordinarily, aplotter hastoreckon with fearbefore thefact. Inthiscase, hehastofeartheaftermath too, thepopulace toobeing against him, norcanhehope foranyref- uge. Ofthisonecould give many examples. Iwillgive only one example thatwas amemory toourfathers. Annibale Bentivo- glio(d.1445), ancestor oftheliving Annibale Bentivoglio II (1469- 1540), who was Prince ofBologna, was targeted and killed bytheCanneschi band, leaving Giovanni hissonstillin diapers. Right after theassassination, thepopulace roseandkilled alltheCanneschi. This happened because ofthepopularity ofthe Prince sothatthough there wasnoheirwho could rule, they fol- lowed uponareport thatBentivogll hadanatural soninFlorence who wasablacksmith (Sante, 1426-1463).
