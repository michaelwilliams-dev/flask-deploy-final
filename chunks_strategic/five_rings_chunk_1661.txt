Interpretation Count Lustlghad aneagle eyeforother people’s weaknesses. He saw them inthesmallest gesture. Loller, forinstance, overtipped waiters, seemed nervous inconversation with theconcierge, talked loudlyabout hisbusi» ness. Hisweakness, Lustig knew, was hisneed forsocial validation and for therespect that hethoughthiswealth had earned him. He was also chroni- cally insecure. Luslighad come tothehotel tohunt forprey.

Observance III Intheyear 1559, theFrench king Henri lldied inajousting exhibition. His sonassumed thethrone, becomingFrancis 11,butinthebackgroundstood Henri’s wife andqueen, Catherine de’Médjcis, awoman who hadlong agoproven herskill inaffairs ofstate. When Francis died thenext year, Catlierine took control ofthecountryasregenttoher next soninline of succession, thefuture Charles IX,amere tenyearsold atthetime. The main threats tothequeens powerwere Antoine deBourbon, king ofNavarre, and hisbrother, Louis, thepowerful prince ofCondé, both of whom could claim therighttoserve asregent instead ofCatherine, who, after all, was Italian——-a foreigner. Catherine quickly appointed Antoine lieutenant general ofthekingdom,atitle that seemed tosatisfy hisambi- tion. Italso meant that hehad toremain incourt, where Catherine could keepaneyeonhim. Her next move provedsmarter still: Antoine had a notorious weakness foryoung women, sosheassigned oneofher most at- tractive maids ofhonor, Louise deRouet, toseduce him. Now Antoine’s intimate, Louise reportedallofhisactions toCatherine. The move worked sobrilliantlythat Catherine assignedanother ofher maids toPrince Condé, and thus was formed her atcadron 2mla1Lt——“lly1'ng squadron”-—of young grls whom she used tokeeptheunsuspecting males inthe court under hercontrol. In1572 Catherine married 05herdaughter, Marguerite deValois, to Henri, the sonofAntoine and the newking ofNavarre. Toputafamilythat hadalways struggled againsther soclose topowerwas adangerous move, sotomake sure ofHenri’s loyaltysheunleashed onhim theloveliest mem- berofher“flying squadron,”Charlotte deBeaune Semblancay,baroness ofSauves. Catherine didthis even thoughHenri wasmarried toherdaugh- ter.Within weeks, Marguerite deValois wrote inhermemoirs, “Mme. de Sauves socompletely ensnared myhusband that we nolonger sleptto- gether,nor even conversed.” The baroness was anexcellent spy andhelpedtokeep Henri under Cathei-ine’s thumb. W’hen thequeen’s youngest son, theDuke ofAlencon, grewsoclose toHenri that shefeared the twomight plot against her, she assigned thebaroness tohim aswell. This most infamous member ofthe flying squadron quicklyseduced Alengon, and soon thetwo youngmen foughtover herandtheir friendship quickly ended, alongwithanydanger ofaconspiracy.And while Iam onthe subject, them isartwher fact that d¢'.vvrw’s mmrimi.
