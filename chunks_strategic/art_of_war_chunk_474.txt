range our soldiers in order of battle, the enemy is overwhelming strength suddenly appears on the scene. Advancing, we can nowhere take a breathing-space; retreating, we have no haven of refuge. We seek a pitched battle, but in vain; yet standing on the defensive, none of us has a moment�s respite. If we simply maintain our ground, whole days and months will crawl by; the moment we make a move, we have to sustain the enemy�s attacks on front and rear. The country is wild, destitute of water and plants; the army is lacking in the necessaries of life, the horses are jaded and the men worn-out, all the resources of strength and skill unavailing, the pass so narrow that a single man defending it can check the onset of ten thousand; all means of offense in the hands of the enemy, all points of vantage already forfeited by ourselves:�in this terrible plight, even though we had the most valiant soldiers and the keenest of weapons, how could they be employed with the slightest effect?" Students of Greek history may be reminded of the awful close to the Sicilian expedition, and the agony of the Athenians under Nicias and Demonsthenes. [See Thucydides, VII. 78 sqq.].] 11. On dispersive ground, therefore, fight not. On facile ground, halt not. On contentious ground, attack not. 1. CHAPTER 12. THE NINE SITUATIONS 96 [But rather let all your energies be bent on occupying the advantageous position first. So Ts�ao Kung. Li Ch�uan and others, however, suppose the meaning to be that the enemy has already forestalled us, sot that it would be sheer madness to attack. In the SUN TZU HSU LU, when the King of Wu inquires what should be done in this case, Sun Tzu replies: "The rule with regard to contentious ground is that those in possession have the advantage over the other side. If a position of this kind is secured first by the enemy, beware of attacking him. Lure him away by pretending to flee� show your banners and sound your drums�make a dash for other places that he cannot afford to lose�trail brushwood and raise a dust�confound his ears and eyes�detach a body of your best troops, and place it secretly in ambuscade. Then your opponent will sally forth to the rescue."] 12. On open ground, do not try to block the enemy�s way. [Because the attempt would be futile, and would expose the blocking force itself to serious risks. There are two interpretations available here. I follow that of Chang Yu. The other is indicated in Ts�ao Kung�s brief note: "Draw closer together"�i.e., see that a portion of your own army is not cut off.] On the ground of intersecting highways, join hands with your allies. [Or perhaps, "form alliances with neighboring states."] 13. On serious ground, gather in plunder. [On this, Li Ch�uan has the following delicious note: "When an army pen- etrates far into the enemy�s country, care must be taken not to alienate the
