ready ear to the reports of his spies, who had secretly gone over to the enemy and were already in Fan Chu�s pay. They said: "The only thing which causes Ch�in anxiety is lest Chao Kua should be made general. Lien P�o they consider an easy opponent, who is sure to be vanquished in the long run." Now this Chao Kua was a sun of the famous Chao She. From his boyhood, he had been wholly engrossed in the study of war and military matters, until at last he came to believe that there was no commander in the whole Empire who could stand against him. His father was much disquieted by this overweening conceit, and the flippancy with which he spoke of such a serious thing as war, and solemnly declared that if ever Kua was appointed general, he would bring ruin on the armies of Chao. This was the man who, in spite of earnest protests from his own mother and the veteran statesman Lin Hsiang-ju, was now sent to succeed Lien P�o. Needless to say, he proved no match for the redoubtable Po Ch�i and the great military power of Ch�in. He fell into a trap by which his army was divided into two and his communications cut; and after a desperate resistance lasting 46 days, during which the famished soldiers devoured one another, he was himself killed by an arrow, and his whole force, amounting, it is said, to 400,000 men, ruthlessly put to the sword.] 12. Having DOOMED SPIES, doing certain things openly for purposes of de- ception, and allowing our spies to know of them and report them to the enemy. [Tu Yu gives the best exposition of the meaning: "We ostentatiously do thing calculated to deceive our own spies, who must be led to believe that they have been unwittingly disclosed. Then, when these spies are captured in the enemy�s lines, they will make an entirely false report, and the en- emy will take measures accordingly, only to find that we do something quite different. The spies will thereupon be put to death." As an example of doomed spies, Ho Shih mentions the prisoners released by Pan Ch�ao in his campaign against Yarkand. (See p. 132.) He also refers to T�ang Chien, who in 630 A.D. was sent by T�ai Tsung to lull the Turkish Kahn Chieh-li into fancied security, until Li Ching was able to deliver a crushing blow against him. Chang Yu says that the Turks revenged themselves by killing T�ang Chien, but this is a mistake, for we read in both the old and the New T�ang History (ch. 58, fol. 2 and ch. 89, fol. 8 respectively) that he escaped and lived on until 656. Li I-chi played a somewhat similar part in 203 B.C., when sent by the King of Han to open peaceful negoti- ations with Ch�i. He has certainly more claim to be described a "doomed spy", for the king of Ch�i, being subsequently attacked without
