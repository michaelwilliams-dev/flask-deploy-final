lie low or the reverse. He instances the action of Cho-ku Liang, who sent the scornful present of a woman�s head-dress to Ssu-ma I, in order to goad him out of his Fabian tactics.] Force him to reveal himself, so as to find out his vulnerable spots. 24. Carefully compare the opposing army with your own, so that you may know where strength is superabundant and where it is deficient. [Cf. IV. ss. 6.] 25. In making tactical dispositions, the highest pitch you can attain is to con- ceal them; [The piquancy of the paradox evaporates in translation. Concealment is perhaps not so much actual invisibility (see supra ss. 9) as "showing no sign" of what you mean to do, of the plans that are formed in your brain.] conceal your dispositions, and you will be safe from the prying of the subtlest spies, from the machinations of the wisest brains. [Tu Mu explains: "Though the enemy may have clever and capable of- ficers, they will not be able to lay any plans against us."] 25. How victory may be produced for them out of the enemy�s own tactics� that is what the multitude cannot comprehend. 26. All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can see is the strategy out of which victory is evolved. [I.e., everybody can see superficially how a battle is won; what they cannot see is the long series of plans and combinations which has preceded the battle.] 25. Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but let your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances. [As Wang Hsi sagely remarks: "There is but one root- principle underlying victory, but the tactics which lead up to it are infinite in number." With this compare Col. Henderson: "The rules of strategy are few and simple. They may be learned in a week. They may be taught by familiar illustrations or a dozen diagrams. But such knowledge will no more teach a man to lead an army like Napoleon than a knowledge of grammar will teach him to write like Gibbon."] 25. Military tactics are like unto water; for water in its natural course runs away from high places and hastens downwards. 26. So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what is weak. [Like water, taking the line of least resistance.] CHAPTER 7. WEAK POINTS AND STRONG 59 25. Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over which it flows; the soldier works out his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing. 26. Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare there are no constant conditions. 27. He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and thereby succeed in winning, may be called a heaven- born captain. 28. The five elements (water, fire, wood, metal, earth) are not always equally predominant; [That is, as Wang Hsi
