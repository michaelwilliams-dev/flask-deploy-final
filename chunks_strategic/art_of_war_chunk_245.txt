the sixth century C.E., during the era of the Northern and Southern dynasties, General Wei of the court of Zhou was the military governor of Jade Wall City. General Wei was known for his exemplary behavior in his official capacity. He was skilled at management and able to win people�s hearts. All of the spies he sent into the territory of the Qi court did their utmost for him, and certain people of Qi whom Wei had bribed sent him reports by letter. Therefore the Zhou court knew all about the movements of Qi. Now the prime minister of Qi was a man of sagacity and courage. General Wei loathed him. One of Wei�s officers, who knew quite a bit about divination, said, �Next year there will be slaughter in the east.� The kingdom of Qi was to the east of Zhou. Wei had this officer compose a song with a double entendre suggesting that the prime minister of Qi was plotting a coup dՎtat; then he had his secret agents plant this song in the main city of Qi.

When the ruler of Zhou heard that the prime minister of Qi was dead, he issued an amnesty for that territory, then mobilized a large army to attack, ultimately destroying the kingdom of Qi.

Cao Cao set out on an expedition north to stop the tribal incursions, intending to strike down the sons of the Chinese warlord as well. That autumn, with the roads north made impassable by heavy rains, Cao Cao�s troops made their way two hundred miles through the hinterland, tunneling through mountains and filling in ravines. They reached north to the territory of the Turanian Xianbei tribes, then headed for the homeland of the Wuheng. Before Cao Cao�s army had gone much more than a hundred miles, they were discovered by the enemy. The brothers, together with several tribal chieftains, led a large force of mounted fighters against them. Now Cao Cao�s equipment was in transport behind him, and few of his soldiers were wearing armor. Everyone was worried. Cao Cao climbed high up a mountainside to survey the situation. Seeing that their opponents� battle lines
