TRANSGRESSION OFTHE LAW TheMexican rebel leader Pancho Villa started out asthechief ofagang of bandits, but after revolution broke out inMexico in1910, hebecame a. kind offolkhero—robbing trains andgiving themoneytothepoor,lead ingdaring raids, andcharmingtheladies with romantic escapades.His ex- ploitsfascinated Americans—he seemed aman from another era, part Robin Hood, partDonJuan.After afewyearsofbitter fighting, however, General Carranza emergedasthevictor intheRevolution; thedefeated Villa and histroopswent back home, tothenorthern state ofChihuahua. Hisarmydwindled and heturned tobanditry again, damaging hispopu- larity. Finally, perhapsoutofdesperation,hebegantorailagainstthe United States, thegringos,whom heblamed forhistroubles. InMarch of1916, Pancho Villa raided Columbus, New Mexico. Ram» paging throughthetown, heand hisgang killed seventeen American sol- diers and civilians. President Woodrow Wilson, likemany Americans, had admired Villa; now, however, thebandit needed tobepunished.Wilson’s advisers urgedhim tosend troops into Mexico tocaptureVilla. For a poweraslargeastheUnited States, they argued,not tostrike back atan armythat had invaded itsterritorywould send the worst kind ofsignal. Furthermore, they continued, manyAmericans saw Wilson asapacifist,a principle thepublic doubted asaresponsetoviolence; heneeded toprove hismettle and manliness byorderingthe useofforce. ThepressureonWflson was strong, and before themonth was out, with theapprovaloftheCarranza government, hesent anarmy often thousand soldiers tocapturePancho Villa. The venture was called the Punitive Expedition,and itsleader was thedashingGeneral john Persh- ing,who had defeated guerrillasinthePhilippinesand Native Americans intheAmerican Southwest. Certainly Pershingcould find andoverpower Pancho Villa. The Punitive Expedition became asensational story, and carloads of US. reporters followed Pershing into action. The campaign, they wrote, would be atest ofAmerican power. The soldiers carried the latest in weaponry,communicated byradio, and were supported byreconnais- sance from theair. Inthefirst fewmonths, thetroops split upinto small units tocomb the wilds ofnorthern Mexico. The Americans offered a$50,000 rewmd forin- fonnation leadingtoVilla’scapture.But theMexican people,who had been disillusioned with Villa when hehad returned tobanditry,now idol- izedhim forfacing thismightyAmericanarmy. They begantogive Persh- ingfalse leads: Villa had been seen inthisvillage,orinthat mountain hideaway, airplanes would bedispatched, troopswouldscurryafter them, and no one would ever seehim. Thewilybandit seemed tobealwaysone stepahead oftheAmerican military. Bythe summer ofthatyear,theexpeditionhad swelled to123,000 men.
