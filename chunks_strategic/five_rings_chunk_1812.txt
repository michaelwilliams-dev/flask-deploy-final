general popularity ,but ,ifhehas tochoose ,hecannot af- ford tobeunpopular with the most powerful faction which is the army .Those new Princes who need tocurry special favor turn sooner tothe army than tothe people .This inturn stands useful tothe Prince according tohow hestands with the populace . For these reasons ,itturns out that Marcus ,Pertinacius ,and Alexander ,allliving modest lives ,loving justice ,enemies ofcru- elty ,human and benign ,all except Marcus - had bad ends . Only Marcus lived and died inhonor .This was because heinher- ited the empire legally .He did not owe ittoeither the soldiers or the populace .As aman ofvirtue for which hewas venerated ,he kept abalance between the two orders onhis own terms ,avoiding both hatred and scorn .But Pertinacius was raised toEmperor against the will ofthe soldiers who ,accustomed toalicentious life under Commodus ,could not tolerate the honest life that Per- tinacius demanded .Arousing their hatred ,and ,besides ,being old , his tenure was compromised from the beginning . Itshould benoted here that hatred isaroused bygood actions aswell asevil actions .Therefore ,asIsaid before ,often aPrince tomaintain the state isforced toact badly .When the general will , ofthe populace ,the military ,orthe nobles ,whatever ,that you need torule iscorrupt you have tohumor it.Good deeds will then THE PRINCE — 103 beyour enemy .Now ,turning toAlexander ,we note that hewas ofsuch abenign nature that infourteen years ofhis reign noone was ever put todeath except bydue process oflaw .Even so,he Iwas held tobe effeminate and under the thumb ofhis mother , scorned 'for this .His army plotted against him and killed him . On the other hand ,turning toCommodius ,Severius ,Anton- ino Caracalla and Massimino ,they were allcruel and rapacious . Inorder toplease the military ,they tolerated any injury tothe populace .All ofthem ,except Severius ,ended badly .Severius ,al- though hefavored the soldiers ,was aman ofvirtue and hewas able toreign successfully because his virtue gained the respect at least ofboth the populace and the army ,sothat the populace was atleast pacified and mute ,while the soldiers were admiring and satisfied . Since his actions for anew Prince were notable ,I'd like to briefly show how Severius knew how touse the qualities ofboth the fox and the lion which Isaid before that aPrince should imitate .― Learning the treachery ofEmperor Julianus when hewas in ancient Illiria ,hepersuaded his army when hewas captain that he would dowell togotoRome toavenge the death ofPertinacius , who had been killed bythe Pretorian guard .With this excuse but betraying noambition tobeEmperor ,hemoved his army against Rome .He was inItaly before they knew hehad left .Arriving in Rome ,hewas out offear elected Emperor assoon asJulian was dead .With this beginning ,two difficulties faced Severius who wanted tolead the whole state .One was inAsia ,where Pescen- nius (governor ofSyria ,(d.194 ),head ofthe Asian armies ,had called himself emperor ,and the other inthe West ,where Albinus (British commander ,(d.197 )also aspired to be Emperor . Severius ,realizing itwould be difficult tofight two fronts ,de- cided tofight Pescennius and
