arethequestions, amongst many others, which suggest them- selves tothecritical reader, andtowhich each must findhisown answer. Machiavelli's personal character nolonger needs tobede- fended. That hewaslicentious, atanyratebymodern standards, must beadmitted, andnodoubt hewas amaster ofdiplomatic dissimulation (ifthatisafault), butinanageofgeneral corrup- tionheappears tohave been exceptionally honest anddirect in hisdealings, andithasbeen truly said thatnoonewaslessMa- chiavellian than Machiavelli. Nodishonorable deed noranyact ofself-interest inhisofficial career wasever imputed tohim; and THE PRINCE —23 hiswritings show that, however much tohisinterest itmay have been towrite insupport ofthepowers oftheday,hewasinvaria- blytruetohisown ideals, andthat, atatime when hewashoping toobtain employment from theMedici, hehadnohesitation inat- tacking thecorruption andambitious territorial policy ofthePa- palCourt asbeing oneofthemain causes ofallItaly's misfor- tunes.

Myself, desir- ingtooffer your Magnificence some token ofmyservice, Ionly find among mymost favored andesteemed things tooffer my own knowledge oftheactions ofgreat men drawn from long ex- perience ofmodernity andantiquity. Having long considered and examined these things, Inow present them toyour Magnificence inthissmall volume. Although Ihold thiswork unworthy ofyour Magnificence, I trust that, foritshumanity, itshould beaccepted, considering that Icanmake nogreater giftthan thesharing ofthefaculty of quickly understanding allthatI,through many years ofdiscom- forts anddangers, learned andunderstand. Ihave neither embel- lished norpuffed upthiswork with refined or/and empty phrases which many commentators use. Instead, Iwanted reality tobe honored, andhope thatthevariety andseriousness ofthesubject make itacceptable.
