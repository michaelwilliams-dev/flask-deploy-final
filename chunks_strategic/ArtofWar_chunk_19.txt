con- sidered elsewhere. 1. CH�EN HAO appears to have been a contemporary of Tu Mu. Ch�ao Kung- wu says that he was impelled to write a new commentary on Sun Tzu because Ts�ao Kung�s on the one hand was too obscure and subtle, and that of Tu Mu on the other too long-winded and diffuse. Ou-yang Hsiu, writing in the middle of the 11th century, calls Ts�ao Kung, Tu Mu and Ch�en Hao the three chief commentators on Sun Tzu, and observes that Ch�en Hao is continually attacking Tu Mu�s shortcomings. His commentary, though not lacking in merit, must rank below those of his predecessors. 2. CHIA LIN is known to have lived under the T�ang dynasty, for his commentary on Sun Tzu is mentioned in the T�ang Shu and was afterwards republished by Chi Hsieh of the same dynasty together with those of Meng Shih and Tu Yu. It is of somewhat scanty texture, and in point of quality, too, perhaps the least valuable of the eleven. 3. MEI YAO-CH�EN (1002-1060), commonly known by his "style" as Mei Sheng- yu, was, like Tu Mu, a poet of distinction. His commentary was published with a laudatory preface by the great Ou-yang Hsiu, from which we may cull the fol- lowing: Later scholars have misread Sun Tzu, distorting his words and trying to make them square with their own one-sided views. Thus, though commentators have not been lacking, only a few have proved equal to the task. My friend Sheng-yu has not fallen into this mistake. In attempting to provide a critical commentary for Sun Tzu�s work, he does not lose sight of the fact that these sayings were in- tended for states engaged in internecine warfare; that the author is not concerned with the military conditions prevailing under the sovereigns of the three ancient dynasties,42 nor with the nine punitive measures prescribed to the Minister of War.43 Again, Sun Wu loved brevity of diction, but his meaning is always deep. Whether the subject be marching an army, or handling soldiers, or estimating the enemy, or controlling the forces of victory, it is always systematically treated; the sayings are bound together in strict logical sequence, though this has been ob- scured by commentators who have probably failed to grasp their meaning. In his 42The Hsia, the Shang and the Chou. Although the last-named was nominally existent in Sun Tzu�s day, it retained hardly a vestige of power, and the old military organization had practically gone by the board. I can suggest no other explanation of the passage. 43See CHOU LI, xxix. 6-10. CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 20 own commentary, Mei Sheng-yu has brushed aside all the obstinate prejudices of these critics, and has tried to bring out the true meaning of Sun Tzu himself. In this way, the clouds of confusion have been dispersed and the sayings made clear. I am convinced that the present work deserves to be handed down side by side with the three great commentaries; and for a
