of not participating in its law) must be either a god or a beast. In the Republic Socrates has included both god and beast in the city, and this accounts for the difference between his political sci? ence and Aristotle's. Socrates, unlike Aristotle, makes eros a political principle. Although tyranny and the tyrannic man are in one way the furthest from philosophy, they are in another the nearest to it. This is why Socrates 1s attracted to those dangerous young men, the po? tential tyrants, who are products of the democracy. With some of these young men (for example, Critias and Alcibiades) his training failed, and as a result he was condemned. But with others (for example, Xeno? phon and Plato) he succeeded, and they have exculpated him. Since the time when Glaucon first asked for a comparison of the lives of the just and unfust men, the action of the Republic has steadily moved toward it. The question has changed en route, for the compari- son is now between the phi]osopher and the tyrant; this wou]d not have satisfied G]aucon at the beginning, nor does it prove the superiority of justice over injustice, un]ess justice is phi1osophy and injustice tyranny. But such a comparison does cast Hght on the origina] prob]em; a]? though the just man on the rack is not proved to be happy, it is dear that happiness does not depend on anything tyranny can acquire. G]au? con's notion of the good things has been a]tered by the marve]ous things he has experienced in this conversation. Previous]y he thought that both just and unjust man desired the same things; now he sees the possibi1ity of a Hfe-the ]ife of Socrates-which is se]f-sufficient and happy. The needfu]ness of tyranny has become questionab]e, and G]au? con wiU never again be ab]e to pose the prob]em as he once did. Hap? piness is not connected with the exp]oitation of other human beings. Socrates makes an image of the sou] for Glaucon's benefit; the desiring part is compared to a many-headed beast, the spirited part to a Hon, and the rationa] part to a man. Socrates thus explains that the Jaws which impose moderation are not made in the interest of an exp]oiter but in the interest of the soul as opposed to the body, of reason as op? posed to desire. This wou]d, of course, hold true on]y in the best regime, but G]aucon himself is now ab]e to say that that makes no dif? ference. Previous]y it had appeared that one must found a city and Jive within it to be a comp1ete man, but now it appears that a man can be happy on his own. The good city exists on]y in speech and is a pattern in the sky for those who want to Jive we11; justice is obedience to the Jaws of that regime. At ]ast man can break from the earth]y city, and G]aucon has gained an inner freedom from its daims and its charms.
