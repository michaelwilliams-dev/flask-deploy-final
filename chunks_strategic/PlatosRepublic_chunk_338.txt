their previous efforts were only the prepara? tion. They must now look for justice and injustice in the city founded in their discourse. Socrates, at the urging of Glaucon, who here takes over from Adeimantus, suggests the following procedure for locating it: since the city is perfectly good, it must be wise, moderate, courageous, and just; therefore, they need only recognize in it the virtues they do know in order to identify what remains as justice. This procedure, however, is open to several obvious objections. Nothing has been done to establish that these four-and only these four-virtues are what makes a city good. Nor is there any indication that the interlocutors know what wisdom, moderation, and courage are, any more than they know what justice is. These virtues have not been thematically discussed here, but we know from other Socratic dialogues that they are as problematic as justice. But, most important of all, Socrates, without stating any grounds for so doing, assumes what he and his companions had set out to prove-that justice is good. Originally the question was: What is justice, and is it good? Now it has become: What good thing is justice? One is compelled to wonder why Glaucon accepts so great a change without comment. It may be because Glaucon is so eager to hear what justice is, because he is of the opinion that he and the others are finally at the borders of the promised land, that he does not, as it were, read the fine print. Moreover, this is his city, and for that reason alone it is good. Common sense dictates the notion that justice is some? thing that has to do with a city and that a good city must possess justice. Glaucon has accepted this city and justice along with it. He could hardly announce that a city he has founded is not just. However, Glaucon's original question has not been answered. In opposition to Thrasymachus, he had suggested that justice means that the strong man serves the weak to the neglect of his own advantage. The life of the rulers in this regime seems to support that suggestion. For the ruled to obey the rulers is strictly to their own advantage since the rulers are dedicated to them. But the doubt remains as to whether it is to the rulers' advantage to care for the ruled. A founder, for his own selï¿½sh reasons, may want the rulers to be just, but he does not thereby prove that it is good for them to be just. The assumption that justice is good and must be in the city is perfectly legitimate from the point of view of founders or men who are discussing a city. But the real ques? tion is postponed until the discussion of the individual: Is justice in the individual man the same as that in the city and does justice in the in- dividual lead to good citizenship? First we look at the perfected city, and
