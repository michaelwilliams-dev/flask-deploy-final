Penguin, 1956], p. 48.) But if one hurries too quickly "behind" Plato's .speech, one loses the sense of the surface. Lee shares with Cornford and many other translators the assurance that they have a sufficient understanding of Plato's meaning, and that that meaning is pretty much the kind of thing Engl_ishmen or Amer? icans already think. However, it might be more prudent to let the reader decide whether "the beautiful and the good" are simply equivalent to "moral values." If they are the same, he will soon enough find out. And if they are not, as may be the case, he will not be prevented from finding that out and thereby putting . his own opinions to the test) � In fact "values, in this sense, is a usage of German origin popularized by sociologists in the last seventy-five years. Implicit in this usage is the distinction between "facts and values" and the conse? quence that ends or goals are not based on facts but are mere individual subjective preferences or, at most, ideal creations of the hum.in spirit. Whether the translator _intend i or n?t, the word "values" conjures up a series of thoughts wruch are ahen to Plato. Every school child knows that values are relative, and thus that the Plato who seems to derive them from facts, or treat them as facts themselves, is unsophisticated. When the case is prejudged for him in this way, how could the student ever find out that th r :was once another way of l okin at these things that had some plaus1b1hty? The text becomes a muror m which he sees only himself. Or, as Nietzsche put it, the scholars dig up what they themselves buried,. , Even if Plato is wrong, the pre-history of our current Wisdom is still of some importance so that the inadequacies of the traditional teaching, which necessitated its replacement, may become clear. - Similarly, the word "moral" is inappropriate. It is questionable whether Plato had a "moral philosophy." There is a teaching about the virtues, some of which find their roots in the city, some in philosophy. Butfin Plato there are no moral virtues, as we find them first described in Aristotle's Ethics. This is a subtle question, one that requires long study, but one that leads to the heart of the difference between Plato and Aristotle, and beyond to the whole dispute about the status of morality. Thus the translator hides another issue. And even if "the beautiful and the good" do add up to what we mean by morality, it is well that the student should know that for Plato morality is composed of two elements, one of which lends a certain splendor to it which is lacking in, say, Kantian morality. And it may also be the case that these two elements are not always wholly in harmony. The good or the just need not always be beautiful or �oble, for example, punishment; and � the beautiful or noble need not
