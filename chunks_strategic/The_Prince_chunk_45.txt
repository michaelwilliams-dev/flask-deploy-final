viable. A Prince needs to know bestial nature and differentiate be.tween the lion and the fox. lion cannot keep away from The snares; the fox can't defend itself from wolves. You need to be a fox to know snares, a lion to scare wolves. He who just knows li.ons doesn't understand. A prudent man cannot rely on good faith nor should he when such observance turns against him or under.mines the reasons themselves for observing it. If men were all good, this percept would not matter. Because men are imperfect and don't keep faith with you, neither must you keep it with them. A Prince will never lack reasons to break good faith. One could and give infinite modern examples show how often peace and promises have been nullified by the unfaithfulness of Princes. He who knew but how to play the fox came out best. But it is best to temper and disguise this nature, to be an actor and dissembler. THE PRINCE ï¿½ 97 Men are so simple and obey their present needs so much that who deceives will easily find someone to deceive. I will give one example: Alexander VI, who never did any.thing else than deceive men, always found victims. No man ever swore to more things and betrayed his promises more. His ruses were always successful because he understood this side of the world well. The Prince needs not always do this, but must appear to have these qualities. To practice deceit is harmful; appearing to have these qualities useful as it is appear compassionate, is to faithful, human, honest and religious, and at the same time be able to change to the opposite. He must know that a Prince, and particularly a new Prince, cannot always observe those qualities that men hold well since, in order to maintain the state as needed, he may have to act contrary to good faith, charity, humanity, and religion. Thus he needs to have a variable nature capable of changing with the winds of fortune and situations, and know how to act not just by the good but, if need be, by the bad. So a Prince needs to take care never to let escape from his lips to anything contrary to these five qualities, seeming always be compassionate, faithful, honest, humane, and religious. Nothing is more important than to seem to be religious. Men judge more by appearances than by deeds. Everyone can see, few people can to actually perceive and judge. Everybody can see what you seem be; few can judge what you actually are. Those few do not dare to oppose the majority, who control state that defends them. the Men's actions, and those of Princes, have no other tribunal or ap.peal. Judgment is final. So a Prince dissimulates to win and main.tain state. Some Princes today, whom is well not to the of it name, preach nothing but peace and good faith, but despise both. Had they respected peace and good faith they would
