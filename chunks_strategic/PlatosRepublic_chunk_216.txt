and blessed he follows it throughout."22 "You have," he said, "described exactly the life of a man attached to the law of equality." "Well," I said, "I suppose that this man is all-various and full of the greatest number of dispositions, the fair and many-colored man like the city. Many men and women would admire his life because i contains the most patterns of regimes and characters." "Yes, that is he," he said. "What then? Shall we set the man of this sort over against democracy as the one who would rightly be called democratic?" "Let's do so," he said. "Then," I said, "the fairest regime and the fairest man would be left for us to go through, tyranny and the tyrant." "Certainly," he said. "Come, now, my dear comrade, what is the manner of tyranny's coming into being? For it is pretty plain that it is transformed out of democracy." "Yes, it is plain." "Does tyranny come from democracy in about the same manner as democracy from oligarchy?" "How?" "The good that they proposed for themselves," I said, "and for the sake of which oligarchy was established, was wealth, wasn't it?" "Yes." "And then the greediness for wealth and the neglect of the rest for the sake ï¿½of money-making destroyed it." "True," he said. "And does the greediness for what democracy defines as good also dissolve it?" "What do y6u say it defines that good to be?" "Freedom," I said. "For surely in a city under a democracy you c would hear that this is the finest thing it has, and that for this rea? son it is the only regime worth living in for anyone who is by nature free." "Yes indeed," he said, "that's an often repeated phrase." "Then," I said, "as I was going to say just now, does the insatiable desire of this and the neglect of the rest change this regime and prepare a need for tyranny?" "How?" he said. "I suppose that when a democratic city, once ifs thirsted for free? dom, gets bad winebearers as its leaders and gets more drunk than it should on this unmixed draught, then, unless the rulers are very gentle and provide a great deal of freedom, it punishes them, charging them with being polluted and oligarchs." "Yes," he said, "thafs what they do." "And it spatters with mud those who are obedient, alleging that they are willing slaves of the rulers and nothings," I said, "while it praises and honors-both in private and in public-the rulers who are like the ruled and the ruled who are like the rulers. Isn't it necessary in such a city that freedom spread to everything?" "How could it be otherwise?" "And, my friend," I said, "for it to filter down to the private houses and end up by anarchy's being planted in the very beasts?" "How do we mean that?" he said. "That a father," I said, "habituates himself to be like his child and fear his sons, and a
