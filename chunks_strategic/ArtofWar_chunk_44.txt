right moment has arrived. The analogous quality in soldiers is the highly important one of being able to reserve their fire until the very instant at which it will be most effective. When the "Victory" went into action at Trafalgar at hardly more than drifting pace, she was for several minutes exposed to a storm of shot and shell before replying with a single gun. Nelson coolly waited until he was within close range, when the broadside he brought to bear worked fearful havoc on the enemy�s nearest ships.] 1. Therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset, and prompt in his decision. [The word "decision" would have reference to the measurement of distance mentioned above, letting the enemy get near before striking. But I cannot help thinking that Sun Tzu meant to use the word in a figurative sense comparable to our own idiom "short and sharp." Cf. Wang Hsi�s note, which after describing the falcon�s mode of attack, proceeds: "This is just how the �psychological moment� should be seized in war."] CHAPTER 6. ENERGY 50 1. Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow; decision, to the releasing of a trigger. [None of the commentators seem to grasp the real point of the simile of energy and the force stored up in the bent cross- bow until released by the finger on the trigger.] 1. Amid the turmoil and tumult of battle, there may be seeming disorder and yet no real disorder at all; amid confusion and chaos, your array may be without head or tail, yet it will be proof against defeat. [Mei Yao-ch�en says: "The subdivisions of the army having been previ- ously fixed, and the various signals agreed upon, the separating and join- ing, the dispersing and collecting which will take place in the course of a battle, may give the appearance of disorder when no real disorder is pos- sible. Your formation may be without head or tail, your dispositions all topsy-turvy, and yet a rout of your forces quite out of the question."] 1. Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline, simulated fear postulates courage; simulated weakness postulates strength. [In order to make the translation intelligible, it is necessary to tone down the sharply paradoxical form of the original. Ts�ao Kung throws out a hint of the meaning in his brief note: "These things all serve to destroy formation and conceal one�s condition." But Tu Mu is the first to put it quite plainly: "If you wish to feign confusion in order to lure the enemy on, you must first have perfect discipline; if you wish to display timidity in order to entrap the enemy, you must have extreme courage; if you wish to parade your weakness in order to make the enemy over-confident, you must have exceeding strength."] 1. Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a question of subdi- vision; [See supra, ss. 1.] concealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of latent energy;
