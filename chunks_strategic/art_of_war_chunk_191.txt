DU MU This means that when warriors are in mortal danger everyone high and low has the same aim, so they are spontaneously on the alert without being drilled, are spontaneously sympathetic without being drafted, and are spontaneously trustworthy without treaties or commands. Master Sun Prohibit omens to get rid of doubt, and soldiers will never leave you. If your soldiers have no extra goods, it is not that they dislike material goods. If they have no more life, it is not that they do not want to live long. On the day the order to march goes out, the soldiers weep. CAO CAO They abandon their goods and go to their death because they have no choice. They weep because they all intend to go to their death.

Even so, this is not sufficiently secure and reliable. It is necessary to allow adaptation to changes, placing soldiers in deadly situations so that they will fight spontaneously, helping each other out like two hands�this is the way to security and certain victory. Master Sun To even out bravery and make it uniform is the Tao of organization. To be successful with both the hard and soft is based on the pattern of the ground. CHEN HAO If the orders are strict and clear, the brave cannot advance by themselves and the timid cannot shrink back by themselves, so the army is like one man. ZHANG YU If you get the advantage of the ground, you can overcome opponents even with soft, weak troops�how much the more with hard, strong troops? What makes it possible for both strong and weak to
