"There is," he said, "no other transformation so quick and so sure from a young man who loves Jionor to one who loves money." "Is this, then," I said, "the oligarchic man?" e "At least he is transformed out of a man who was like the regime out of which oligarchy came." "Then, let's consider if he would be like." [ 231 J ADEIMANTUs/soCRATES .,,. THE REPUBL1 C:-; 554 a "Yes, let's consider that." "In the first place, wouldn't he be similar in giving the highest place to money?" "Of course." "And, further, in being stingy and a toiler, satisfying only his necessary desires and not providing for other expenditures, but enslav? ing the other desires as vanities." "Most certainly." "A sort of squalid man," I said, "getting a profit out of everything, filling up his storeroom--exactly the kind of men the multitude b. praises-isn't this the one who is like such a regime?"

He holds them down not by persuading them that they 'had better not' nor by taming them with argument, but by necessity and fear, doing so because he trembles for his whole substance." "Very much so," he said. "And, by Zeus, my friend," I said, "you'll find the desires that are akin to the drone present in most of them when they have to spend what belongs to others."
