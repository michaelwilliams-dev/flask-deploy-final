his own secret designs, keeping his antagonists in awe. [The train of thought, as said by Li Ch�uan, appears to be this: Secure against a combination of his enemies, "he can afford to reject entangling alliances and simply pursue his own secret designs, his prestige enable him to dispense with external friendships."] CHAPTER 12. THE NINE SITUATIONS 110 Thus he is able to capture their cities and overthrow their kingdoms. [This paragraph, though written many years before the Ch�in State became a serious menace, is not a bad summary of the policy by which the famous Six Chancellors gradually paved the way for her final triumph under Shih Huang Ti. Chang Yu, following up his previous note, thinks that Sun Tzu is condemning this attitude of cold-blooded selfishness and haughty isolation.] 56. Bestow rewards without regard to rule, [Wu Tzu (ch. 3) less wisely says: "Let advance be richly rewarded and retreat be heavily punished."] issue orders [Literally, "hang" or post up."] without regard to previous arrangements; ["In order to prevent treachery," says Wang Hsi. The general meaning is made clear by Ts�ao Kung�s quotation from the SSU-MA FA: "Give instructions only on sighting the enemy; give rewards when you see de- serving deeds." Ts�ao Kung�s paraphrase: "The final instructions you give to your army should not correspond with those that have been previously posted up."

[Cf. supra, ss. 34.] 57. Confront your soldiers with the deed itself; never let them know your design. [Literally, "do not tell them words;" i.e. do not give your reasons for any order. Lord Mansfield once told a junior colleague to "give no reasons" for his decisions, and the maxim is even more applicable to a general than to a judge.] When the outlook is bright, bring it before their eyes; but tell them nothing when the situation is gloomy. 58. Place your army in deadly peril, and it will survive; plunge it into desperate straits, and it will come off in safety. 1. CHAPTER 12. THE NINE SITUATIONS 111 [These words of Sun Tzu were once quoted by Han Hsin in explanation of the tactics he employed in one of his most brilliant battles, already al- luded to on p. 28. In 204 B.C., he was sent against the army of Chao, and halted ten miles from the mouth of the Ching-hsing pass, where the enemy had mustered in full force. Here, at midnight, he detached a body of 2000 light cavalry, every man of which was furnished with a red flag. Their instructions were to make their way through narrow defiles
