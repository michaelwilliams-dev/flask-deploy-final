they have got."] 16. Hence the saying: The enlightened ruler lays his plans well ahead; the good general cultivates his resources. [Tu Mu quotes the following from the SAN LUEH, ch. 2: "The warlike prince controls his soldiers by his authority, kits them together by good faith, and by rewards makes them serviceable. If faith decays, there will be disruption; if rewards are deficient, commands will not be respected."] 17. Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops unless there is something to be gained; fight not unless the position is critical. [Sun Tzu may at times appear to be over-cautious, but he never goes so far in that direction as the remarkable passage in the TAO TE CHING, ch. 69. "I dare not take the initiative, but prefer to act on the defensive; I dare not advance an inch, but prefer to retreat a foot."] 18. No ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his own spleen; no general should fight a battle simply out of pique. 1. CHAPTER 13. THE ATTACK BY FIRE 120 19. If it is to your advantage, make a forward move; if not, stay where you are. [This is repeated from XI. ss. 17. Here I feel convinced that it is an interpolation, for it is evident that ss. 20 ought to follow immediately on ss. 18.] 20. Anger may in time change to gladness; vexation may be succeeded by content. 21. But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into being; [The Wu State was destined to be a melancholy example of this saying.] nor can the dead ever be brought back to life. 22. Hence the enlightened ruler is heedful, and the good general full of cau- tion. This is the way to keep a country at peace and an army intact. 1. Chapter 14 THE USE OF SPIES 1. Sun Tzu said: Raising a host of a hundred thousand men and marching them great distances entails heavy loss on the people and a drain on the resources of the State. The daily expenditure will amount to a thousand ounces of silver. [Cf. II. ss. ss. 1, 13, 14.] There will be commotion at home and abroad, and men will drop down exhausted on the highways. [Cf. TAO TE CHING, ch. 30: "Where troops have been quartered, brambles and thorns spring up. Chang Yu has the note: "We may be reminded of the saying: �On serious ground, gather in plunder.� Why then should carriage and transportation cause exhaustion on the highways?�The answer is, that not victuals alone, but all sorts of munitions of war have to be conveyed to the army. Besides, the injunction to �forage on the enemy� only means that when an army is deeply engaged in hostile territory, scarcity of food must be provided against. Hence, without being solely dependent on the enemy for corn, we must forage in order that there may be an uninterrupted flow of supplies.
