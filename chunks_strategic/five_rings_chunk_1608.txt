OBSERVANCE OFTHE LAW II Intheyear 1831, ayoungwoman named Aurore Dupin Dudevant lefther husband andfamilyintheprovincesand moved toParis. Shewanted tobe awriter; marriage,shefelt, was worse than prison,foritleftherneither the time nor thefreedom topursueherpassion. InParis shewould establish herindependenceand make herliving bywriting. Soon after Dudevant arrived inthecapital, however, shehad tocon front certain harsh realities. Tohaveanydegree offreedom inParisyou had tohave money. For awoman, moneycould onlycome throughmar» rlageorprostitution.No woman had ever come close tomakingaliving by writing. Women wrote asahobby, supported bytheir husbands, orbyan inheritance. Infact when Dudevant first showed herwriting toaneditor, hetoldher, “You should make babies, Madame, notliterature,” ClearlyDudevant had come toParis toattempttheimpossible. Inthe end, though,she came upwith astrategytodowhat nowoman had ever donew-a strategytore-create herself completely, forgingapublic imageof her own making.Women writers before herhad been forced into aready- made role, that ofthe second-rate arfist who wrote mostly forother women. Dudevant decided thatifshehad toplayarole, shewould turn the game around: She would playthepart ofaman. In1832 apublisher acceptedDudevanfs firstmajor novel, Indium. She had chosen topublishitunder apseudonym, “George Sand,” and all ofParis assumed thisimpressivenew writer was male. Dudevant had sometimes worn men’s clothes before creating “George Sand” (she had al- waysfound men‘s shirts andridingbreeches more comfortable); now, as apublic figure, sheexaggeratedtheimage. She added longmen’s coats, gray hats, heavy boots, anddandyishcravats toherwardrobe. She smoked cigars and inconversation expressedherself like aman, unafraid todomiv nate theconversation ortouse a.saucyword, This strange“male/female” writer fascinated thepublic. And unlike other women writers, Sand found herselfacceptedinto theclique ofmale artists. Shedrank and smoked with them, even carried onaffairs with the most famous artists ofEurope—Musset, Liszt, Chopin. Itwas shewho did thewooing,and also theabandoning-—she moved onatherdiscretion. Those who knew Sand well understood that her malepersona pro- tected her from thepublic’s prying eyes.Out intheworld, sheenjoyed playingtheparttotheextreme; inprivatesheremained herself. She also realized that the character of“George Sand” couldgrowstale orpre- dictable, and toavoid this shewouldeverynow and then dramaticallyalter
