leave it half-said, but let's see it adequately." "Speak," he said. "A painter, we say, will paint reins and a bit." ''Yes.� "But a shoemaker and a smith will make them." "Certainly." "Then does the painter understand how the reins and the bit must be? Or does even the maker not understand-the smith and the leather? cutter-but only he who knows how to use them, the horseman?" "Very true." "And won't we say that it is so for everything?" "How?" d. "For each thing there are these three arts-one that will use, one that will make, one that will imitate." "Aren't the virtue, beauty, and rightness of each implement, animal, and action related to nothing but the use for which each was made, or grew naturally?" "That's so." "It's quite necessary, then, that the man who uses each thing be most experienced and that he repcrt to the maker what are the good or bad points, in actual use, of the instrument he uses. For example, about flutes, a flute player surely reports to the flute-maker which ones would d. serve him in playing, and he will prescribe how they must be made, and the other will serve him." "Of course." "Doesn't the man who knows report about good and bad flutes, and won't the other, trusting him, make them?" "Yes." f Book X I 60la-602d 0- t:- SOCRATES/GLAUCON t "Therefore the maker of the same implement will have right trust f concerning its beauty and its badness from being with the man who knows and from being compelled to listen to the man who knows, while � the user will have knowledge." t "Certainly." "And will the imitator from using the things that he paints have knowledge of whether they are fair and right or not, or right opinion due to the necessity of being with the man who knows and receiving prescriptions of how he must paint?" "Neither." "Therefore, with respect to beauty and badness, the imitator will neither know nor opine rightly about what he imitates." "It doesn't seem su." "The imitator, in his making, would be a charming chap, so far as wisdom about what he makes goes." "Hardly." "But all th same, he will imitate, although he doesn't know in what way each thing is bad or good. But as it seems, whatever looks to be fair to the many who don't know anything-that he will imitate." "Of course he will." "Then it looks like we are pretty well agreed on these things: the imitator knows nothing worth mentioning about what he imitates; imitation is a kind of play and not serious; and those who take up tragic poetry in iambics and in epics are all imitators in the highest possible degree." � "Most certainly." "In the name of Zeus," I said, "then, isn't this imitating con? cerned with something that is third from the truth? Isn't that so?" "Yes."" "Now, then, on which one of the parts of the human being does it have
