Thus thesymbolsthat came tobeassociated withLouis-Philippewere neither thescepternor the crown, but thegray hatandumbrella with which hewould proudlywalk thestreets ofParis, as ifhewere abourgeois outfor astroll. VVhen Louis—Philippeinvited James Rothschild, the most importantbanker inFrance, tohispalace,hetreated him asanequal.And unlikeanyking before him, notonlydidhetalk busi- nesswith Monsieur Rothschild butthat wasliterallyallhetalked, forhe loved moneyand had amassed ahuge fortune. Asthereignofthe“bourgeois king” plodded on,peoplecame tode spirehim. The aristocracy could notendure thesightofanunkingly king, andwithin afewyears they turned onhim. Meanwhile thegrowing class of thepoor, including theradicals who had chased outCharles X,found no satisfaction inaruler who neither acted asakingnorgovernedasaman of thepeople.The bankers towhom Louis-Philippewas themost beholden soon realized thatitwastheywho controlled thecountry,nothe,andthey treated him with growing contempt. One day,atthestart ofatraintripor- ganizedfortheroyal family, JamesRothschild actually berated him-and iripublic-—for being late. Once thekinghad made news bytreatingthe banker asanequal;now thebanker treated thekingasaninferior. Eventually theworkers’ insurrections that hadbrought down Louis- Phi1ippe’s predecessor began toree.-merge,and theking putthem down with force. Butwhat was hedefendingsobrutally?Nottheinstitution ofthe monarchy,which hedisdained, nor ademocratic republic,which hisrule prevented.What hewasreally defending,itseemed, was his own fortune, andthefortunes ofthebankers—-not awaytoinspire loyalty among the citizenry.
