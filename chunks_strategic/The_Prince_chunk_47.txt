estate to protect him. So much so that if he join to this popularity, it is unlikely that any.one will plot against him. Ordinarily, a plotter has to reckon with fear before the fact. In this case, he has to fear the aftermath too, the populace too being against him, nor can he hope for any ref.uge. Of this one could give many examples. I will give only one example that was a memory to our fathers. Annibale Bentivo.of glio(d.1445), ancestor the living Annibale Bentivoglio II (1469-1540), was Prince Bologna, was targeted and who of killed by the Canneschi band, leaving Giovanni his son still in diapers. Right after the assassination, the populace rose and killed all the Canneschi. This happened because of the popularity of the Prince so that though there was no heir who could rule, they fol.lowed up on a report that Bentivogll had a natural son in Florence who was a blacksmith (Sante, 1426-1463). The Bolognesi went and got him and made him governor of the city, where he ruled until Giovanni came into his majority. I conclude that a Prince need not worry about conspiracies when he enjoys popularity. When he is an enemy of the people and hated, then he should fear everything and everyone. A well-ordered state and a wise Prince should diligently avoid embitter. THE PRINCE ï¿½-101 ing the nobles and try to favor the people and keep them happy. This is one of the most important tasks of a Prince . One of the best ordered and governed kingdoms of our times is France . Here there are many constitutional guidelines on which the liberty and security of the King depend . The first of these is the parliament and its authority. The laws of that state , recogniz.ing the ambitions and insolence of power and the nobles , and judging it necessary to reign them all in, and , on the other hand , recognizing the universal hatred of potentates arising from fear , the laws did not want the King to deal with this , trying to remove the friction he would have with the nobles if he favored the popu. lace , and the friction he would have with the populace if he fa. vored the nobles . So they created a third force that without rely. ing on the King could hold off the nobles and favor the populace . Nothing could be better or more prudent nor contribute more to the security of the King and the Kingdom . A further moral can be drawn from this : namely, that a Prince should let others adminis. trate unpopular measures and only claim credit for popular meas. ures . Again, a Prince should esteem the nobles but not alienate the populace . Maybe someone will object, considering the life and death of the Roman Emperors , that there are examples opposed to my opinion. They will say some emperors ruled and lived exem. plararily showing great virtue
