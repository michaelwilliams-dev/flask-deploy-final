presented by older thinkers. The progress of science was understood to be strictly paralleled by that of society; individualism seemed no threat to human ties, and mass society no threat to meaningful participation. The softening in this narrow liberal position can be seen in the substitution in common discourse of the less positively charged term technology for science, the pervasive doubt about whether the mastery of nat re is a veryï¿½good idea, and a commonly expressed sentiment oflostness and powerlessness on the part of individual citizens. In the days of thoughtless optimism, Plato was considered irrelevant and his criticism was not available to warn us of possible dangers. Now it is recognized that he had all the doubts we have today and that the founding myth of his city treats men and women as literally rooted in its soil. Everybody is sure that Plato knew something about community, but he makes today's comfortable communitarians uncomfortable by insisting that so much individuality must be sacrificed to community. Moreover, they rightly sense that Plato partly parodies the claims and the pretensions of community. The uninvolved Socrates, distrustful of neat solutions, does not appear to be a very reliable ally of movements. Plato, criticized in the recent past for not being a good liberal, is now shunned for not being a wholehearted communitarian. He is, however, back in the game. But, above all, the Platonic text is now gripping because of its very viii , radica], more than up-to-date treatment of the "gender question." In a stunning demonstration of the power of the philosophic imagination, P]ato treats the question as it was never again treated up to our own day? proving thereby that reason can penetrate to the essentia1s at any time or p]ace.Werfectjustice, Socrates argues in the dia1ogue, can be achieved on]y by suppression of the distinction between the sexes in an important matters and the admission of women on an equa] footing to an activities of the city, particu]ar]y the most important, fighting and thinking. CoroHary to this is the virtua] suppression of the bodily differences between the sexes and aH the psychic affects habitua1]y accompanying those differences, especial1y shame, which effective]y separates women from men.) In consequence, Socrates further recognizes that there must be a revo]ution in the family in which its functions are transferred to the community, so that women wi11 not have to bear the doub]e burden of career mothers. Day-care centers, abortion, and the desacralization of marriage are on]y a few of the easily recognizab]e e]ements of this revolu? tion in favor of synthesizing the opposites man/woman into the unity, human being. Some activists even find Socrates' analysis too radical, sacrificing an the charms of family ties to rationa1 considerations of justice. Reason, it seems, is corrosive of the mysteries of human connectedness. Others rightly suspect that Socrates is not sufficiently convinced of the factual equa1ity of women. Socrates is again the questionable any, but he marks the starting point of something that would be unimaginable ifhe
