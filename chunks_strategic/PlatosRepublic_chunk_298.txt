wage-earner's art. Thrasymachus, however, is not quick enough to notice this and take advantage of it. This wage-earner's a1t is ubiquitous. It accompanies all of the arts and directs their action. It is thus an architectonic art. Contrary to Soc? rates' argument that each art is complete and perfect in itself, needing nothing beyond itself, a super art is necessary to supplement all the arts. For they must be related to each other and to the whole of which their subject matters are a part. The carpenter's, bricklayer's, and plasterer's aits are not sufficient unto themselves; they must be. guided by the architect's art. Money, or what we would call the economic system, is a sort of architectonic principle; for in ordinary cities the amount of money paid for the products of the arts determines what arts are practiced, how they are practiced, and what kind of men practice them. Money is the common denominator running through all the arts; it seems to establish their value and provides the motivation for prac? ticing them. Thrasymachus, who is seeking students in Athens, is surely a part of this system. His rhetoric is of use to him only if people desire it and are willing to pay for learning it. Socrates, by means of this fabrication of an ait of wage earning, points, as he did in the discussion with Polemarchus, to the need for a master art to supplement the other arts. Money is manifestly an inade? quate architectonic or regal principle, and its inadequacies serve to in? dicate what a true architectonic art would have to be and accomplish. Money cannot discern the nï¿½ature of each of the arts nor evaluate the contribution their products make to happiness; the price paid for the services of the arts is merely the reflection of the untutored tastes of the many or the rich. Money constitutes an artificial system which subor? dinates the higher to the lower. And the man who serves for money be? comes the slave of the most authoritative voices of his own time and place, while renouncing the attempt to know, and live according to, the natural hierarchy of value. He is always torn between the demands of his art and the needs qf the marketplace. The wage-earne.,r's art is a kind of political substitute for philoso? phy. The intention of philosophy is to understand the nature of the arts and order them toward the production of human happiness, and to educate men to desire those things which most conduce to happiness. It can claim to rule all the arts for it alone tries to know the whole, the true whole, as opposed to the view of the whole of this time or place, and it restores the unity to a man':,,,. life. It demands total dedication to its objects, as was required of the alis, while giving ample reward to its practitioner in that it is the perfection of his nature and his greatest satisfaction.
