of political thought comes to 1ight, and a series of alternatives is presented to the mind. These authors all self-con? scious]y used the same term and in their disagreement were re? ferring to the same issues. The reader must be sensitized by the use of the term to a who]e e in which "virtue" was still a political issue. Cornford uses safeguard instead of guardian. This is unob? jectionable in itself, but guardian is a word that has been laden with significance by what has preceded in the'book. The rulers, in particular those who fight and thus ho]d the power in the city, have been called guardians since their introduction in Book II. In a sense the prob]em of the Republic was to educate a ru1ing class which is such as to possess the characteristics of both the citizen, who cares for his country and has the spirit to fight for it, and the philosopher, who is gentle and cosmopolitan. This is a quasi-impossibility, and it is the leading theme of the onerous and complex training prescribed in the�succeeding five books. If the education does not succeed, justice must be fundamentally compromised with the nature of those who hold power. In the context under discussion here Socrates is discussing the regimes which have to be founded on the fundamental compromise be? cause of the flawed character of the guardians' virtues. Regimes depend on men's virtues, not on institutions; if the highest virtues are not pres? ent in the rulers, an inferior regime must be instituted. There are no guardians above the guardians;)the only guardian of the guardians is a proper education/It is this theme to which the reader's attention must be brougl:�. )( AncvSocrates tells us something important about that education: it consists of reason but not reason alone. It must be mixed with a non? rational element which tempers the wildness and harshness of both the pre-philosophic and philosophic natures. Reason does not suffice in the formation of the good rule:vl'his is not the place to enter into a discus? sion of the full bearing of this lesson, but it is of utmost significance. The term music is indeed a difficult one for the modern reader, but there has been a full discussion of it in several passages of the Republic, and any other word wou]d surely be most misleading. And, in fact, the sense we give to music is not totally alien to the understand? ing G]aucon and Adeimantus had at the start. It is Socrates who transformed their view by concentrating on the speech and its truth while subordinating rhythm and harmony. It is Socrates who ra- tionalized music. � Is it not conceivable that the Republic is a book meant for people who are.going to read widely in it, and that it would be unfair to cheat them for the sake of the subjective satisfaction of those who pick out sentences aimlessly? Is the man who comes away from the text with the interpretation feared by
