if it were otherwise, his account would be of little value, based as it is on the SHIH CHI and expanded with romantic details. The story of Sun Tzu will be found, for what it is worth, in chapter 2. The only new points in it worth noting are: (1) Sun Tzu was first recommended to Ho Lu by Wu Tzu-hsu. (2) He is called a native of Wu. (3) He had previously lived a retired life, and his contemporaries were unaware of his ability. The following passage occurs in the Huai-nan Tzu: "When sovereign and ministers show perversity of mind, it is impossible even for a Sun Tzu to encounter the foe." 4The appellation of Nang Wa. 5SHI CHI, ch. 31. 6SHI CHI, ch. 25. 7The appellation of Hu Yen, mentioned in ch. 39 under the year 637. 8Wang-tzu Ch�eng-fu, ch. 32, year 607. CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 8 Assuming that this work is genuine (and hitherto no doubt has been cast upon it), we have here the earliest direct reference for Sun Tzu, for Huai-nan Tzu died in 122 B.C., many years before the SHIH CHI was given to the world. Liu Hsiang (80-9 B.C.) says: "The reason why Sun Tzu at the head of 30,000 men beat Ch�u with 200,000 is that the latter were undisciplined." Teng Ming-shih informs us that the surname "Sun" was bestowed on Sun Wu�s grandfather by Duke Ching of Ch�i [547-490 B.C.]. Sun Wu�s father Sun P�ing, rose to be a Minister of State in Ch�i, and Sun Wu himself, whose style was Ch�ang-ch�ing, fled to Wu on account of the rebellion which was being fomented by the kindred of T�ien Pao. He had three sons, of whom the second, named Ming, was the father of Sun Pin. According to this account then, Pin was the grandson of Wu, which, considering that Sun Pin�s victory over Wei was gained in 341 B.C., may be dismissed as chronolo- gical impossible. Whence these data were obtained by Teng Ming-shih I do not know, but of course no reliance whatever can be placed in them. An interesting document which has survived from the close of the Han period is the short preface written by the Great Ts�ao Ts�ao, or Wei Wu Ti, for his edition of Sun Tzu. I shall give it in full: I have heard that the ancients used bows and arrows to their advantage.9 The SHU CHU mentions "the army" among the "eight objects of gov- ernment." The I CHING says: "�army� indicates firmness and justice; the experienced leader will have good fortune." The SHIH CHING says: "The King rose majestic in his wrath, and he marshaled his troops." The Yellow Emperor, T�ang the Completer and Wu Wang all used spears and battle- axes in order to succor their generation. The SSU-MA FA says: "If one man slay another of set purpose, he himself may rightfully be slain." He who relies solely on warlike measures shall be exterminated; he who relies solely on
