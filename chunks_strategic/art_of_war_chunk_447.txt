that the beleaguered city was in the Han State, and thus not actually part of Chao territory. But the spies had no sooner departed than Chao She began a forced march lasting for two days and one night, and arrive on the scene of action with such astonishing rapidity that he was able to occupy a commanding position on the "North hill" before the enemy had got wind of his movements. A crushing defeat followed for the Ch�in forces, who were obliged to raise the siege of O-yu in all haste and retreat across the border.] 5. Maneuvering with an army is advantageous; with an undisciplined multi- tude, most dangerous. [I adopt the reading of the T�UNG TIEN, Cheng Yu-hsien and the T�U SHU, since they appear to apply the exact nuance required in order to make sense. The commentators using the standard text take this line to mean that maneuvers may be profitable, or they may be dangerous: it all depends on the ability of the general.] 6. If you set a fully equipped army in march in order to snatch an advantage, the chances are that you will be too late. On the other hand, to detach 1. CHAPTER 8. MANEUVERING 62 a flying column for the purpose involves the sacrifice of its baggage and stores. [Some of the Chinese text is unintelligible to the Chinese commentators, who paraphrase the sentence. I submit my own rendering without much enthusiasm, being convinced that there is some deep-seated corruption in the text. On the whole, it is clear that Sun Tzu does not approve of a lengthy march being undertaken without supplies. Cf. infra, ss. 11.] 7. Thus, if you order your men to roll up their buff-coats, and make forced marches without halting day or night, covering double the usual distance at a stretch, [The ordinary day�s march, according to Tu Mu, was 30 LI; but on one occasion, when pursuing Liu Pei, Ts�ao Ts�ao is said to have covered the incredible distance of 300 _li_ within twenty-four hours.] doing a hundred LI in order to wrest an advantage, the leaders of all your three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy. 8. The stronger men will be in front, the jaded ones will fall behind, and on this plan only one-tenth of your army will reach its destination. [The moral is, as Ts�ao Kung and others point out: Don�t march a hundred LI to gain a tactical advantage, either with or without impedimenta. Man- euvers of this description should be confined to short distances. Stonewall Jackson said: "The hardships of forced marches are often more painful than the dangers of battle." He did not often call upon his troops for ex- traordinary exertions. It was only when he intended a surprise, or when a rapid retreat was imperative, that he sacrificed everything for speed. 1 ] 9. If you march fifty LI in order to outmaneuver the enemy, you will lose the leader of your first
