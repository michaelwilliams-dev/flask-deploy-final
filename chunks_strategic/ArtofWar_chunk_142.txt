advantages. CAO CAO Set up rules that are not to be broken, do not fail to punish any offenders. DU MU When it comes to establishing rules and regulations, everyone, high and low, should be treated alike. DU YOU Compare whose orders are the more effective�whose subordinates do not dare to disobey. MEI YAOCHEN Make everyone equal under the law. WANG XI See who is able to make rules clear and commands easy to follow, so that people listen and obey. DU MU (On the matters of strength and training) When superior and subordinate are in harmony, equally brave in battle, that makes for strength. DU YOU Know whose armaments are more effective, and whose troops are carefully chosen and well trained. As it is said, �If soldiers do not practice day to day, on the front lines they will be fearful and hesitant. If generals do not practice day to day, on the front lines they will not know how to adapt.� DU MU (Turning to the subject of punishments and rewards) Rewards should not be out of proportion, punishments should not be arbitrary. DU YOU Know whose system of rewards for the good and punishments for the bad is clearly defined. As it is said, �If rewards are immoderate, there will be expenditure that does not result in gratitude; if punishments are immoderate, there will be slaughter that does not result in awe.� MEI YAOCHEN When people deserve reward, this should be duly noted even if you personally detest them.

If you are inferior in all of these seven things, you have lost even before you go into battle. Therefore it is possible to know the victor beforehand.

Forces are to be structured strategically, based on what is advantageous. CAO CAO Structure depends on strategy: strategy is determined according to events.
