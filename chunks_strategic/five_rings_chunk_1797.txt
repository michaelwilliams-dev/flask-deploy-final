ofRomagna anditsandpeoples andthathewasgoing toenjoy thefruits ofhislabors. This partofthetaleisworth noting andofusetoimitate, and Iwon't hold itback. Having taken Romagna, hefound powerless Lords who only despoiled their subjects andsowed discord, not union, sothatthewhole province wasfullofthieves, brigands, andallmanner ofinsolence administered it.TheDuke judged it necessary togiveitgood government inorder tomake itpeaceful andobedient tohisown rule. Buthepromoted Ramiro deLorqua, acruel andexpedient man, towhom heentrusted fullpowers. De Lorqua subjugated Romagna quickly andefficiently, tohisfame. TheDuke hadsecond thoughts anddecided such excessive au- 54- Niccolò Machiavelli thority was too much ,because hehimself didn't want tobecome hated .He proposed acivil tribunal inthe province with apresi- dent where every city would have itsrepresentative .He knew the past measures had generated some hatred sotopurge the state and gain the populace and show that the cruelty had not come from him but from the strict character ofhis minister ,hetook the occasion inCesena one morning toshow his minister's body cut intwo pieces with awood club and abloody knife beside it.The ferocity ofthis calmed the populace and rendered them docile and satisfied . -But letusreturn tothe story .The Duke ,powerful and for the moment secure ,armed and having disarmed the offending parties around had noobstacle tofurther acquisition ifhecould gain the respect ofthe French - because heknew that the King ,recog- nizing his error late ,would nolonger support him .So,the Duke looked for anew friendship and vacillated with France incase the French made amove against the Kingdom ofNaples ,against the Spaniards who were then assaulting Gaeta .The Duke's idea was toget their support— inwhich hewould have succeeded ifAlex- ander had lived . This ,incurrent matters ofstate ,was his policy .But astothe future ,hehad toworry first that anew successor tothe Papacy would behis friend and not take away from him what Alexander had given .He set himself four goals to accomplish this :first , eliminate those Lords whom hehad despoiled ,inorder tooutma- neuver anew Pope ;second ,toline upthe noblemen ofRome in order toput the brakes onanew Pope ;third ,torig the College of Cardinals inhis favor ;and fourth ,toacquire enough territory be- fore the current Pope died sothat hecould withstand any first at- tack against himself .Ofthese four goals ,hehad ,byAlexander's death ,accomplished three .The fourth hehad underway .He had killed asmany enemies ashecould reach and few had survived ; hehad lined upthe Roman noblemen ;hehad gained alot ofsup- port inthe College ofCardinals ;astoacquisitions ,hehad been designated Lord ofTuscany ,possessing Perugia and Piombino , and even Pisa was his protectorate . THE PRINCE —55 Asifhehadnorespect forFrance (which nolonger held him because theFrench hadtaken away theterritories oftheSpanish where everyone hadtobuyfriends), hejumped onPisa. Next, Lucca andSiena caved in,partly because ofjealousy ofFlorence andpartly from fear. Florence hadnorecourse left.Ifhehadsuc- ceeded inallthis, hewould have hadstrength andfame enough to save himself onhisown virtue andfortune. ButAlexander died after five years ofliving bythesword. HelefttheDuke with Romagna intact, everything elseintheair,andtwopowerful en- emy armies inthefield, theFrench andtheSpaniards, andthe Duke himself wassickunto death. TheDuke wasofsuch ferocity andsuch virtue andknew well enough —how men winandlose, andsovalid were thebasics thathehadbuilt inashort time, that ifhehadn't hadtwoarmies against himandhehadbeen well he would have shaken offevery difficulty.
