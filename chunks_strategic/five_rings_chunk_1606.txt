“Very few, mangénéml,butIdaresayyouwill man- agetofind one.” ItwasarrangedthatNapoleon would arrive atTalleyrand’s house the following dayatseven AM. andwould spendthemorningthere. The “boar hunt” would take placeintheafternoon. Throughoutthemorningthe ex- cited general talked nothingbutboar hunting. Meanwhile, Talleyrandsee cretlyhad hisservantsgotothemarket, buy two enormous black pigs,and take them tothegreat park. After lunch, the hunters and their hounds setoffforthe Bois de Boulogne.Atasecret signal from Talleyrand, the servants loosed oneofthe pigs.“Isee aboar,” Napoleon cried joyfully, jumpingonto hishorse togive chase. Talleyrand stayed behind. Ittook half anhour ofgalloping through theparkbefore the“boat” wasfinally captured. Atthemoment oftriumph, however, Napoleonwasapproached byone ofhisaides, who knew the creature could notpossiblybe atboar, and feared thegeneralwould be ridiculed once thestory gotout:“Sir,” hetoldNapoleon, “yourealize of course that this isnot abear but apig.” Flyinginto arage, Napoleon immediatelysetoffatagallopforTal- leyrand’shouse. Herealized alongthewaythat hewould now bethebutt ofmanyajoke,and thatexplodingatTalleyrandwould onlymake him LAW 24' 199 190 LAW 24more ridiculous; itwould bebetter tomake ashow ofgood humor. Still, he didnothide hisdispleasurewell. Talleyrand decided totrytosoothe thegeneral’s bruised ego. Hetold Napoleonnot togoback toParis yet-«heshould again gohunting inthe park.There weremanyrabbits there, andhunting them had been a.fa- vorite pastime ofLouis XVI. Talleyrandeven offered toletNapoleonuse a setofguns that had once belongedtoLouis. With much flatteryandcajol— ery, heonce again gotNapoleontoagreetoahunt. The partyleftfortheparkinthe late afternoon. Alongtheway, Napoleon toldTalleyrand, “Pm notLouis XVI, Isurelywon’t kill even one rabbit.” Yetthat afternoon, strangely enough,theparkwasteemingwith rabbits. Napoleon killed atleastfifty ofthem, and hismood changed from angertosatisfaction. Attheend ofhiswild shooting spree, however, the same aideapproachedhim andwhispered inhisear, “Totellthetruth, sir,I ambeginningtobelieve these arenotwild rabbits. Isuspect that rascal T31» leyrandhasplayed another jokeonus.” (The aide wasright: Talleyrand had infact sent hisservants back tothemarket, where theyhadpurchased dozens ofrabbits and then had released them intheBois deBoulogne.) Napoleon immediatelymounted hishorse andgalloped away,this time returning straighttoParis. Helater threatened Talleyrand,warned him not totell asoul what hadhappened; ifhebecame thelaughingstock ofParis, there would behell topay. Ittook months forNapoleontobeable totrust Talleyrand again,and henever totally forgavehim hishumiliation. Interpretation Courtiers arelike magicians: They deceptively playwithappearances, only letting those around them seewhat theywant them tosee. With so much deceptionandmanipulation afoot, itisessential tokeep peoplefrom seeing yourtricks andglimpsing your sleight ofhand. TalleyrandwasnormallytheGrand Vlfizard ofCourtiership, and but forNapoleoifs aide, heprobablywould have gotten away completelywith both pleasinghismaster andhavingajokeatthegenerafs expense.
