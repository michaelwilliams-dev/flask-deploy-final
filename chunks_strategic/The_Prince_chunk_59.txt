recourse against fate. They de.duce from this that there is nothing much to do and those things should be left to themselves. This opinion has been reinforced in our times by events and happenings more so every day, beyond human intervention. As I think about this, I often incline to their opinion. However, free will is not entirely powerless. It may be that fortune is the arbiter of half our world, but she also leaves half a world to our governance. I compare fortune to one of those floods that fill the plains, uproot trees, ruin buildings, and slide mud from one corner to the other. Everyone runs before her and can.not block her. But, although this is so, men in quiet times can prepare, repair, and build dams, so that fortune, when it comes, may channel here or there and its effects need not be so devastat.ing or widespread. Fortune strikes in a similar way. She wrecks havoc where vir.tue is weak to resist her and she strikes where she knows no dams at world governed by fortune and by God and that men and banks will contain her. If you look Italy, the place of all these convulsions, and conditions that are open fortune, the to you will see Italy a country without banks and resources to is fend off fate. If here there were valor and virtue as in German, Spain, and France, fortune would not have played fast and loose as she has. This is enough said as to resisting fortune and fate in general. As to the particulars, I see Princes rise today and fall tomor 128 � Niccol� Machiavelli row without any change in their nature or capability whatsoever. This happens first for the many reason I have already described, and namely that the Prince who relies on fortune gets ruined as soon as fortune changes. I also believe that a Prince succeeds who adapts to his time, while that Prince falls who is at variance with the ways of his time. Men advance to their goals in different ways, whatever they aim at � glory and riches. One respects fate, the other rebels against it. One proceeds violently; another with art. One is pa.tient; another is not. Each of these ways may succeed. One sees men with similar methods come to different ends, and also men come to the same end with different methods � one proceeding with caution, the other intrepid. This happens for no other reason the to one than turn of the times. Sometimes they are suited method, sometimes to another. Thus as I said it happens that two persons operating with the same methods in one case reach the objective and in the other case not. Thus, the good varies according to circumstances, whether one should govern with caution and patience to suit the times and it will be good and successful. But if times and circumstances change it is possible to get ruined by not changing method. One
