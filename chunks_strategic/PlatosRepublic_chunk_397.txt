image of a bed. He is thus an imitator of an imitator and his products have very little reality. Now, however, Soc? rates abandons the reference to the ideas and their maker, and no longer asserts that the craftsman look to ideas in their making. He substitutes a common-sense notion for all of this. The craftsman is in? deed dependent, however, not on an idea but on the command of the man who uses his products. The poet is still at the bottom, but now there is a human being at the top who practices what Socrates calls the user's art. The horseman, who knows the equipment necessary to using a horse well, can tell the artisans what he needs and give them their im? pulse without knowing their arts; he is more important than they are, and the end of their activity is his activity. The user's art comes closer to poetry and philosophy in that it, too, deals with the relations of things and is not restricted to any single art. The broadest such art would be the one that treats of happiness-the legislator's art. The legislator organizes the whole city with a view to the good life-the end of all action-and the various arts ultimately are guided by the role their products play in that life. The horseman who told the sad? dlemaker and the blacksmith what he needed, is, in turn, told by the general what is needed from the cavalry; and the general, finally, is told by the statesmen or the legislator what the army must do. Only the legislator oversees the whole; and by looking to the legislator, the ar? tisans know what the purpose or end of their products is. There is no idea which the legislator can look to and imitate mechanically; his art comprises wisdom entire. The user's art is political science, of which Socrates is the founder. To follow out the image of the Republic, the sheep are guarded by dogs who are obedient to shepherds who are in the service of owners: the people are guarded by warriors who are obe? dient to guardians who are ultimately obedient to philosophers or who [ 4,31 J arephilosophers themselves. In the best caseï¿½ the legislators are philosophers, but in any case the legislator is the master of the city. In this perspective it becomes clear what Socrates means when he says that the poet is an imitator of an imitator. The poet imitates the legislator. He must appeal to an audience; and in that sense he imitates the tastes and passions of that audience. But the tastes and passions of the audience have been formed by the legislator, who is understood to be the craftsman who builds the city according to the pattern provided by his view of nature. Thus the poet, who looks to the audience which looks to the legislator, is at the third remove from nature. The poet's function leads him to be a servant of convention; his
