CHAPTER 12. THE NINE SITUATIONS 114 [As the hare is noted for its extreme timidity, the comparison hardly ap- pears felicitous. But of course Sun Tzu was thinking only of its speed. The words have been taken to mean: You must flee from the enemy as quickly as an escaping hare; but this is rightly rejected by Tu Mu.] Chapter 13 THE ATTACK BY FIRE [Rather more than half the chapter (SS. 1-13) is devoted to the subject of fire, after which the author branches off into other topics.] 1. Sun Tzu said: There are five ways of attacking with fire. The first is to burn soldiers in their camp; [So Tu Mu. Li Ch�uan says: "Set fire to the camp, and kill the soldiers" (when they try to escape from the flames). Pan Ch�ao, sent on a diplomatic mission to the King of Shan-shan [see XI. ss. 51, note], found himself placed in extreme peril by the unexpected arrival of an envoy from the Hsiung-nu [the mortal enemies of the Chinese]. In consultation with his officers, he exclaimed: "Never venture, never win! 1 The only course open to us now is to make an assault by fire on the barbarians under cover of night, when they will not be able to discern our numbers.

The rest of his men, armed with bows and crossbows, he posted in ambuscade at the gate of the camp. He then set fire to the place from the windward side, whereupon a deafening noise of drums and shouting arose on the front 1"Unless you enter the tiger�s lair, you cannot get hold of the tiger�s cubs." 115 CHAPTER 13.
