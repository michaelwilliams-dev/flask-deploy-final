can establish supremacy. It is mobilized by gain in the sense that it goes into action when it sees an advantage. Dividing and recombining is done to confuse opponents and observe how they react to you, so that then you can adapt in such a way as to seize victory. Master Sun Therefore when it moves swiftly it is like the wind, when it goes slowly it is like a forest; it is rapacious as fire, immovable as mountains. LI QUAN It is swift as the wind in that it comes without a trace and withdraws like lightning. It is like a forest in that it is orderly.
