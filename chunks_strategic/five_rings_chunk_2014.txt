topossess money. Women's favor canbewonbygifts,andtheyhave ataste foradornment and public display. Women play agreat role inthecorruption ofregimes, aswillbeshown inBooks VIIIandIX.Ifhalfthecity isnoteducated tothe city's virtues, thecity willnotsubsist. This isacitywithout homes, andthewomen havemore toovercome ifthey aretoaccept it, fortheir natures leadthem tolovetheprivate things mostanddraw the men toasimilar love.They must share themen's tastes, orthey will resist thechanges inthefamily Socrates isabout topropose. Inthesecond place, theexclusive maleness, somuch connected with battle, isnotthewhole ofhuman nature, although itmayappear [3«3 THEREPUBLIC sotothemen.Thefemale represents gentleness, andthecomplete soul mustembrace both principles. Pheidippides, intheClouds, and Calli- cles, intheGorgias, think ofSocrates asunmanly, apale-faced individ- ualwho sitsaround andgossips rather thanengaging intheactivities ofrealmen. IntheTheaetetus Socrates compares himself toakind of woman, amidwife; andintheSymposium herecounts thathelearned thesecrets ofhiserotic science from awoman. Justasacityneeds the female, sodoes thesoul,butperhaps inamore fundamental way. Full humanity isadiscrete mixture ofmasculinity andfemininity. When talking about warrior-guardians thefeminine could beforgotten; but this latest discussion isaharbinger ofthephilosopher-guardians. Having successfully metthe firstwave—thesame education and wayoflifeforwomen asformen, Socrates andGlaucon prepare toface thesecond— thecommunity ofwomen andchildren. Inthediscussion ofthisproposal there islessemphasis onthecomic element; theprob- lems touched onherehave been themes oftragedy— Antigone and Oedipus comemostimmediately tomind— aswell ascomedy. Socrates andGlaucon agree topostpone thequestion ofthepossibility ofthis institution— that is,according totheprocedure theyhave adopted, the question ofwhether itisnatural— infavor offirstdescribing itand its advantages. The sexual relations oftheguardian and auxiliary classes are treated asthough they exist only fortheproduction ofchildren forthe city.Anattempt ismade torationalize sexual desire inmaking it responsive tothecommand ofthelaw. Attraction andlove inthem- selvesknow nolimits ofpropriety, exigency, laworcountry. They are most dangerous toacitybecause theirpower issuch astodrown all other sentiments intheir intensity, andthey indicate anelement ofman which isbynature unpolifical. Thesexual passion canbetrained and repressed, but itisnotusually thought possible tomake itrespond only tothose objects chosen bythecity, inawayand atatimedeemed fitting bythecity.Buthere Socrates acts asthough itwere feasible, if noteasy, tochannel eros forthebenefit ofthecity;otherwise itwould have tobeleftprivate, repressed andexhorted, butalways asomewhat hostile beast, evenwhen asleep. Now therulers must tellmany lies. And these liesmustbebigger onesthan thenoble lie.Thenoble lieis more easily believable than these lieswillbe,inasmuch astheformer concerns theorigins and, after aperiod oftime, there willbeno witnesses ofthose origins lefttogainsay it;inclination willbeacon- stant witness against theliesoftherulers insexual matters. SoSocrates invokes thegods. Marriages, hesays, aresacred. But inthisarrange- ment ofthings, marriage means nothing more than atemporary sexual [384 ] Interpretive Essay relationship, forthere arenoprivate homes, noprivate children, and thecitizens maybeexpected tohavemany suchmarriages. Socrates ex- plains thatthesacred iswhat isbeneficial tothecity.Appetizing and frequent sexual relations aretobethereward forexcellence inpublic service; thiswillmotivate thecitizens toperform their responsibilities wellandwillinsure thatthosewhoareofthegreatest virtue willpro- duce themost children. Inorder tomake thissystem work, therulers willhavemany concerns notshared byrulers inlessperfect cities; these concerns could wellbethesubject ofcomedy inthese other cities. Just aserotic activity becomes apart ofaman's public duty, so theoffspring oftheunions mustbecome partofpublic property. The family isabolished, unless oneconsiders thecity asonefamily. The problem ofAntigone cannot arise, forthere canbenoconflict between thefamily andthecity.Theintention ofthenoble lieisfurthered: men arefinally deprived ofeverything which theymight lovemore thanthe city; allmenarebrothers. Buttheeffect ofthis istoremove whatever is natural inthefamily andreplace itwithanentirely conventional base. Afather, ifheisanything, istheonewhoengenders thechild.Afather whodidnotdosowould beacompletely artificial entity, atbest a substitute forthenatural father.Law orconvention must taketheplace ofnature inorder toinsure thepossibility ofthis city.Children areto transfer tothecitywhat theywould give totheir parents. This, too, is completely unnatural. Itis,however,
