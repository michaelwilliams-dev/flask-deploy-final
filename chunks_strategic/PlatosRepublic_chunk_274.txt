apparent Socratic op? timism concerning the best case-the regime where philosophers ru]e. Careful reading wi11 revea] that this aneged harmony is more of a paradox than a solution, that it covers a host of tensions which come to light in the Jess than perfect cases. Socrates may wen have reformed philosophy so that it was no longer indifferent to politics, but it was certainly no less subversive of all existing regimes than was the older philosophy. If philosophers are the natural rulers, they are the riva1s of an the actual rulers; philosophy, rather than being simp]y use1ess, seems to be conspiratorial. Philosophy may very wen be harmfu] to rea] regimes, and it is very unlikely that the regime at which it aims can come into being. In fact, the Republic tacitly admits the truth of the charges made against Socrates: he is not orthodox in his be1iefs about the gods and sets up new beings, the ideas, which are superior to the gods; the philosophers he trains will be men who both know the nature of things in the air and below the earth and are able to speak with con? summate ski11; and he teaches young men to despise Athens because he teaches them to love a regime in which phi1osophers are kings. Socrates denies that he is unjust because of this, but there must be a revo]ution in men's understanding of justice for just deeds to be recognized as such. In an imperfect regimes, his presence is problerpatic, and he must behave prudently: he undermines the attachment to the regime and laws of the city, but he is the salvation of all those in it who wish to live the good life. The Republic shows us why Socrates was accused and why there was good reason to accuse him. Not on]y does he tel1 us about the good regime, but we see his effect on the young men he was said to have cor? rupted. Socrates, in 1eading them to a justice which is not Athenian, or even Greek, but is rather human, precisely because it is rational, shows the way to the truth about political things and develops the extremely complex relationship of that truth to civil society. These questions are most relevï¿½ant to modem man, although they are perhaps harder for him to understand than for men of any previous generation. They are relevant to him because he admits his need for "values" and because the progress of publicly useful science now threatens him with destruc? tion; they are harder for him to understand because he has been taught that "values" cannot be established by reason and that science is simply salutary for society. For these reasons it behooves us to study the Republic. For it is the first book which brings philosophy "down into the cities"; and we watch in it the foundation of political science, the only discipline which can bring the blessings of reason to the city. We will learn that the establishment
