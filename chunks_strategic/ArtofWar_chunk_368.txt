and soldiers must also be familiar with it. Nowadays those who know the way of strategy well are rare. As far as the way is concerned, several of them exist. The law of Buddha is the way that saves people. The way of Confucianism is the way that leads to correctness in literature. Medicine is the way that cures illnesses. The poet teaches the way of poetry. There exist a number of ways in the arts�that of the man of taste,12 that of the practitioner of archery, and those of other arts and crafts. Adepts train in these in their fashion, according to their manner of thinking, and are fond of them in accordance with their dispositions. But very few like the way of strategy.

For a warrior, it is not possible not to study it.13 Nowadays there are certain people to be found everywhere who declare themselves accomplished practitioners of strategy, but in general they practice only the sword. Recently the Shinto priests of Kantori and Kashima in the prefecture of Hitachi14 have founded schools, saying that their art was transmitted to them by the gods, and they have propagated their art in various fiefs. Among the ten talents and the seven arts that have long been known,15 strategy is considered to be a pragmatic domain.16 Since it is a pragmatic domain, it is not appropriate to limit it just to the technique of the sword. On the basis of the principles of the sword alone,17 you will not be able to understand the sword well, and you will be far from being in accord with the principles of strategy. There are people who make a
