andprob- lems ofancient science (cf.Aristotle, Politics, 1316a; and534d, note 26). The surface reason forthenumber's appearance here istorelate thecos- micprinciples ofscience tothisperfect regime, toestablish aharmony be- tween theknowledge ofnattn-e andofpolitics. Inthiswaythehighest human things would notbemerely theplaythings ofchance, andthere couldbeper- fecttechnical control overtheconditions ofdecent political life.The riddle- some character ofthenvimber's presentation maywell reflect onthereality of thatharmony andhence onthenaturalness and possibility ofthisregime, which issupposed tobeboth possible andaccording tonature. Thisregime waspredicated ontheemergence ofrulerswhoareknowers orartisans intheprecise sense first insisted onbyThrasymachus and later adopted bySocrates. Their highest function wastoinsure thereproduction of thespecies, thereplenishment oftheirownnumbers. Ifhuman reproduction cannot becontrolled, ifthere isnoscience ofeugenics combined withthepower touse itwell,chance ruleshuman affairs, andregimes must lower their stand- ardsandrelyonmore ordinary rulers. Thebestregime istheregime ofartisans whoareabletoliveaccording tonature because theyhavemastery overchance. Tothisendcommunism was instituted, women were treated likemen,and thefamily wasabolished. Theguardians were turned intoaherd likeaherd of cattle which canbeusedbyabreeder, and alltheordinarily cherished human ways ofloving andreproducing were suppressed bytherulers' marriage regu- lations andmanipulations. Theperfect artisans ruleanimals inorder toreduce thedisproportion that isalways present inhuman herds, asopposed tobrutish ones,between nature andconvention, between thegoodandone'sown.The nuptial number represents thisscience ofeugenics, andthefailure ofthere- gime indicates thefailure ofitsproject. This conclusion issupported bythe corruption ofthesonofthearistocratic father (549c ff.)which ismeant tobe theparallel tothecorruption ofthearistocratic city.Theson fallsfrom hisfa- ther'swayoflifebecause ofadisharmony between themother andthefather. Toseethisinanother lightonemight welllook toAristophanes' char- [467 ] THEREPUBLIC acterization oftheproblems which beset Socrates. Thephilosopher believes himself tobeindependent ofconvention anddevotes himself, along withaso- ciety ofcompanions, tostudy ofthehighest things for itsown sake. But, in- sistsAristophanes, thephilosopher hasnotreflected sufficiently ontheprecon- ditions ofsuch awayoflifeand isactually dependent onthecityand itscon- ventions. Hedoesnothing useful andproduces none ofthevital necessities, butheneeds foodandclothing. Sohemust steal tokeep alive.Andheneeds philosophic companions; buthisisanall-male society which carmot reproduce itself; therefore hemust, asitwere, stealthecity's sonsaway from itsconcerns inorder torecruit them forhissociety. Aristophanes shows thatthecitywill nottolerate such alawbreaker initsmidst. Socrates respor^ds intheRepublic byasserting that ifthephilosopher adopts Aristophanes' twoproposals inthe Ecclesiazusae— theequality ofwomen and totalcommunism —hecancon- struct aregime inwhich hisphilosophic lifewillnotbeincontradiction with hispolitical life.This citywillfeedandclothe him.And initwomeft willgive birth tochildren who aretobephilosophers andnotmembers ofafamily or citizens intheusual sense oftheword; natural animal reproduction willreplen- ishthephilosophers' society which represents thenatural human wayoflife, thusproducing aharmony between thetwosenses ofnature andshowing that thetension between cityandphilosophers isneither natural nornecessary. Soc- rates with ascience ofeugenics could, bymeans ofbodily procreation, have children whowere potential philosophers andwould nolonger beforced to abandon hisown inquest ofgoodmen;bodyandsoul, cityandphilosopher, would work together. Thefailure toachieve control over births signals aneven morecomic failure ofSocrates than thatridiculed intheClouds. Itisinthis way thatheproved hissuperiority toAristophanes. 6.Hesiod, Works andDays, 106—201, should beconsulted inreference totheentire discussion ofthetransformation ofregimes. 7.Iliad, VI,211.Thecontext ofthequote should beread. 8.Cf.Seuen Against Thebes, 451, 570. 9.TheGreek istirnema, allied totheword forhonor (cf.545b, note 3) .Theconnection between thetwonotions isvaluing.
