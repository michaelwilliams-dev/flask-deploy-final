present, dwells within the one possessing it as a savior of virtue throughout life." "What you say is fine," he said. "Such, then," I said, "is the timocratic youth, like the timocratic city." "Most certainly." "And this is how he comes into being," I said. "Sometimes he is the young son of a good father who lives in a city that is not under a good regime, a father who flees the honors, the ruling offices, the law- suits, and everything of the sort that's to the busybody's taste, and who �� is willing to be gotten the better of so as not to be bothered." � "In what way, then, does he come into being?" he said. "When," I said, "in the first place, he listens to his mother com? . plaining. Her husband is not one of the rulers and as a result she is at a � disadvantage among the other women. Moreover, she sees that he isn't very serious about money and doesn't fight and insult people for its sake in private actions in courts and in public but takes everything of the sort in an easygoing way; and she becomes aware that he always turns his mind to himself and neither honors nor dishonors her very much. She complains about all this and says that his father is lacking in courage and too slack, and, of course, chants all the other refrains such as women are likely to do in cases of this sort." "Yes, indeed," said Adeimantus, "it's just like them to have many complaints." "And you know," I said, "that the domestics of such men-those domestics who seem well-disposed-sometimes also secretly say similar things to the sons, and if they see someone who owes him money or does some other injustice and whom the father doesn't prosecute, they urge the son to punish all such men when he becomes a man, and thus to be more of a man than his father. And when the son goes out, he hears and sees other similar things-those in the city who mind their own business called simpletons and held in small account, and those who don't, honored and praised. Now when the young man hears and sees all this, and, on the other hand, hears his father's argu? ments and sees his practices at close hand contrasted with those of the others, he is drawn by both of these influences. His father waters the calculating part of his soul, and causes it to grow; the others, the desir? ing and spirited parts. Because he doesn't have a bad man's nature, but has kept bad company with others, drawn by both of these influences, he came to the middle, and turned over the rule in himself to the mid? dle part, the part that loves victory and is spirited; he became a haughty-minded man who loves honor." "In my opinion," he said, "you have given a complete description of this man's genesis." "Therefore," I said, "we
