true soph? ist, the true educator, is the public assembly-the sovereign body of the people; it forms the tastes of the young by its thunderous expressions of approval and disapproval. It is almost impossible for a noble youth to resist the city's praise and blame and the prospects it offers him. The man who undertakes to teach the truth to such a youth faces many difficulties. The youth himself is disinclined to renounce the charms which draw him. And, if the teacher succeeds in influencing him, the unruly sailors will persecute the teacher who is robbing them of a great prop of their power. First the teacher will be intimidated by threats; finally he will be brought to trial and condemned to death as a corrup? tor of the youth. All he was trying to do was teach the true politics which would enable the young man to do good for the city while punish? ing its deceivers. Such a teacher, to be sure, takes his pupil away from the immediate and most visible concerns of the people, but his in? tention is to provide the people with the kind of men they would pray to have as rulers. Socrates claims that men such as himself do not cor? rupt the youth but try to save them from corruption. By thus showing that those who could be genuine philosophers abandon the practice of philosophy, Socrates tries to explain away the fact that some philosophers seem vicious by claiming that they are im? postors. Incomplete, little men move into the positions left free by the corruption of those who might truly have filled them. Such impostors are motivated by vanity, and they are less interested in being wise than in being reputed wise and in winning arguments. Willing to make the worse argument appear the stronger, they are the source of the accusa? tion that the philosophers are teachers of rhetoric. In this terrible sit? uation, the true philosophers are isolated, defenseless, and unable to help the city. For their own preservation they therefore reluctantly withdraw into private life, though their real vocation is ruling. These arguments in defense of philosophy are directed to soothing the people's anger and apprehension. They show how Socrates believes the people must be talked to. They must, above all, be shown that he is a good citizen, even though he may appear useless or even vicious. Thus he insists that these appearances are the result of a fatal misun? derstanding. He is truly the people's friend; he appeals to them over the heads of their rulers. He responds to the great accusations against him-that he is a meddler in things in the heavens and below the earth, a corruptor of the youth, and a deceiver. However, he is silent about the charge of atheism. ï¿½ Having argued that the charges against philosophy are unjust, Soc? rates now proceeds to suggest that the people could accept the rule of philosophers. It is altogether a difficult business
