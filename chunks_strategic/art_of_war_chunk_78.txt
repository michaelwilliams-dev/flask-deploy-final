did so. This act of severity filled the army with wholesome awe, and from that time forth even articles dropped in the highway were not picked up.] 27. If we know that our own men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the enemy is not open to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory. [That is, Ts�ao Kung says, "the issue in this case is uncertain."] 28. If we know that the enemy is open to attack, but are unaware that our own men are not in a condition to attack, we have gone only halfway towards victory. [Cf. III. ss. 13 (1).] 29. If we know that the enemy is open to attack, and also know that our men are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the nature of the ground makes fighting impracticable, we have still gone only halfway towards victory. 30. Hence the experienced soldier, once in motion, is never bewildered; once he has broken camp, he is never at a loss. [The reason being, according to Tu Mu, that he has taken his measures so thoroughly as to ensure victory beforehand. "He does not move reck- lessly," says Chang Yu, "so that when he does move, he makes no mis- takes."] 31. Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and know Earth, you may make your victory complete. [Li Ch�uan sums up as follows: "Given a knowledge of three things�the affairs of men, the seasons of heaven and the natural advantages of earth�, victory will invariably crown your battles."] Chapter 12 THE NINE SITUATIONS 1.

When a chieftain is fighting in his own territory, it is dispersive ground. [So called because the soldiers, being near to their homes and anxious to see their wives and children, are likely to seize the opportunity afforded by a battle and scatter in every direction. "In their advance," observes Tu Mu, "they will lack the valor of desperation, and when they retreat, they will find harbors of refuge."] 3. When he has penetrated into hostile territory, but to no great distance, it is facile ground. [Li Ch�uan and Ho Shih say "because of the facility for retreating," and the other commentators give similar explanations. Tu Mu remarks: "When your army has crossed the border, you should burn your boats and bridges, in order to make it clear to everybody that you have no hankering after home."] 93 CHAPTER 12. THE NINE SITUATIONS 94 4. Ground the possession of which imports great advantage to either side, is contentious ground. [Tu Mu defines the ground as ground "to be contended for." Ts�ao Kung says: "ground on which
