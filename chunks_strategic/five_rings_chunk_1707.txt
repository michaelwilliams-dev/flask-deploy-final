Friends who offer favors without askingforpaymentwill later want some thingfardearer than themoney youwould have paid them. The bargain hashidden problems,both material andpsychological. Learn topay, then, and topaywell. Ontheother hand, this Law offers great opportunitiesforswindling anddeception ifyouapplyitfrom theother side. Dangling thelure of at free lunch isthe conartisfs stock intrade. No man was better atthis than the most successful con artist ofour age,Joseph Weil, a.k.a. “The Yellow Kid.” The Yellow Kid learned early that what made hisswindles possiblewas hisfellow humans’ greed. “This desire togetsomething fornothing,” heonce wrote, “has beenvery costly tomany peoplewho have dealt with meand with other can men. , . . When peoplelea.rn——a3 Idoubt theywill—that theycan’t getsomething fornothing, crime will diminish and weshall alllive ingreater harmony.” Over theyearsWeil devisedmany waystoseduce peoplewith theprospect ofeasy money. Hewould hand out“free” real estate——who could resist such anoffer?——and then thesuckers would learn they had topay$25 to register thesale. Since theland wasfree, itseemed worth thehigh fee, and theYellow Kidwould make thousands ofdollars onthephony registration. Inexchangehewould give hissuckers aphonydeed. Other times, he would tellsuckers about afixed horse race, orastock thatwould earn 200 percentinafew weeks. Ashespun hisstories hewould watch thesucker’s eyes openwide atthethoughtofafree lunch. The lesson issimple:Baityour deceptions with thepossibility ofeasy money. Peopleareessentially lazy,and want wealth tofallintheir lap rather than towork forit.For atsmall sum, sellthem advice onhow to make millions (P.T.Barnum didthislater inlife), and that small sum will become afortune when multiplied bythousands ofsuckers. Lure people in with theprospect ofeasy money and you have the room towork still more deceptionsonthem, since greedispowerful enoughtoblindyourvictims toanything. And astheYellow Kid said, half thefun isteachingamoral lesson: Greed does notpay.
