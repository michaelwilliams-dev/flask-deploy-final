ofaforeigner. Butluck smiled onhimfrom another quar- ter,andthus heescaped thefateofhisbadchoice. Namely, al- though hisSpanish auxiliaries were broken atRavenna, theSwiss came tohisaidandchased theFrench sothathedidnotbecome prisoner ofeither hisenemies orhisauxiliaries. TheFlorentines, when they were disarmed, sent10,000 French toPisa, running a greater riskthen atanytime intheir history. In1353 theEmperor ofConstantinople fielded 10,000 Turks against theGreeks who, when thewarwasover, didn't want toleave. Thus began theser- vitude oftheGreeks totheInfidel. Losers, therefore, relyonsuch arms —they aremuch more dangerous than mercenaries. Auxiliaries leadtosure ruin—they areunited inobedience toothers. Mercenaries, once victorious, if they want tooffend you, need more time andopportunity. They arenotallinaccord andbesides, arebeing paid byyou. Athird ofthem depend directly onyour authority andarenotlikely toof- fend you. Tosummarize, mercenaries aredangerous because of 82—Niccolò Machiavelli their cowardice, while auxiliaries aredangerous when they are brave. Awise Prince therefore avoids dependence onthese forces andrelies onhisown. Better tolosewith hisforces than winwith arms ofothers, judging victory notrealwhen acquired with the arms ofothers. Icannot cease citing Cesare Borgia andhisdeeds. Heentered Romagna with auxiliaries, leading theall-French troops in.With them, hetook Imola andForlì. But,suspecting his own security, heturned tomercenaries, believing them tobeless dangerous. Heturned totheOrsini andVitelli, gotridofthem, andfellback onhisown forces. You canjudge thedifference in such forces bymeasuring thereputation oftheDuke with the French, then with theOrsini andVitelli, andthen onhisown. His reputation only Increased andhewasnever admired more, than when hewasseen incommand ofhisown forces. Idon't want towander from fresh Italian examples, butIdon't want toforget Gerone II(265-215 B.C.), tyrant ofSyracuse, al- ready mentioned. Gerone, made captain ofthearmy bytheSyra- cusans, realized thatthemercenaries were useless —sohehad them cuttopieces, andthen waged warwith hisown men andnot with aliens. Iwant toremind youinthisregard ofafigure from theOldTestament. David offered toSaul tocombat Goliath, the troublesome Philistine. Saul offered David help—histroops. But David refused, saying hecouldn't count onthem. Hepreferred to confront theenemy with hissling anddagger. The troops and arms ofothers either hang heavy, turnagainst you, orforce you. Charles VII(1422-1461), King ofFrance, father ofLouis XI, byvalor andfortune having liberated France from theEnglish, realized thisneed andconscripted citizens andinfantry. Hisson Louis dismissed theinfantry andrelied onSwiss mercenaries. These twoerrors, aswesaw, ledtodangers tohisrealm. Byrais- ingtheSwiss, heundermined hisown troops. Hedismissed his infantry andputtheother troops under Swiss leadership. Grow- ingaccustomed tothesuperiority oftheSwiss, theFrench thought they couldn't winwithout them. Thereafter theFrench could notresist theSwiss. Without theSwiss, they couldn't pre THE PRINCE —83 vailagainst others. French armies became mixed —part their own, partmercenary. These armies, although better than auxilia- riesandonehundred percent mercenaries, were notasgood as native troops. This example suffices, because ifCharles' order hadprevailed France would have been unbeatable. Meager hu- man prudence isthus corrupted andbegins something thinking it isgood without realizing thesecret poison underneath. Whoever ruling aPrincipality cannot seeanevilaborning is nottruly wise —andthisisgiven tofew. Ifyoulook atthefirst cause ofthefalloftheRoman Empire, youwillseethatthey be- gantoconscript theGoths. From thatmove firstcame theweak- ening ofRoman imperial forces. Thevalor theyhadpassed tothe Goths. Iconclude thatwithout itsvery own native troops noPrinci- pality issecure; infact, fatehangs onfortune, nolonger having thevirtuous valor thatinadversity defends itinfullfaith. Itwas always theview ofwise men “quod nihil sittaminformum aut instabile quam tampotential nonsusvinixa” (Tacitus: “No hu- man things issoweak andunstable asareputation ofstrength not based onactual force”). One's own arms canbebased onsub- jects, citizens, orrelatives: allother forces aremercenaryor
