happening?" "That's likely." "Then the tyrant must gradually do away with all of them, if he's going to rule, until he has left neither friend nor enemy of any worth whatsoever." "Plainly." "He must, therefore, look sharply to see who is courageous, who is great-minded, who is prudent, who is rich. And so happy is he that there is a necessity for him, whether he wants to or not, to be an enemy of all of them and plot against them until he purges the city." "A fine purgation," he said. "Yes," I said, "the opposite of the one the doctors give to bodies. For they take off the worst and leave the best, while he does the op? posite." "For it seems," he said, "to be a necessity for him, if he is to rule." "Therefore," I said, "he is bound by a blessed necessity that prescribes that he either dwell with the ordinary many, even though hated by them, or cease to live." "That is precisely his situation," he said. "To the extent that he is more hateful to the citizens for doing these things, won't he have more need of more-and more trustworthy -armed guards?" "Of course." "Who are these trustworthy men? And where will he send for them?" "On their own, many will come flying," he said, "if he gives the wages." "These are drones, by the dog," I said, "of whom you are, in my opinion, again speaking, foreign ones of all sorts." "Your opinion is true," he said. "And who are the trustworthy ones on the spot? Wouldn't he be willing-" "vVhat?" "-to take away the slaves from the citizens, free them and include them among the armed guards surrounding himself?" "Oh, he would be veryï¿½ willing," he said, "since these are, doubtless, the men most trustworthy for him." "The tyrant of whom you speak," I said, "is a blessed thing, if he uses such men as friends and trustworthy helpers after he has destroyed his former ones." "But he certainly does use such men," he said. "And these companions admire him," I said, "and the new citizens have intercourse with him, while the decent men hate him and flee from him." "What else would they do?" "It's not for nothing," I said, "that tragedy in general has the reputation of being wise and, within it, Euripides of being particularly so." 567d e 568 a "Why is that?" "Because, among other things, he uttered this phrase, the product of shrewd thought, 'tyrants are wise from intercourse with the b wise.'29 And he plainly meant that these men we just spoke of are the wise with whom a tyrant has intercourse." "And he and the other poets," he said, "extol tyranny as a con? dition 'equal to that of a god'30 and add much else, too.'' "Therefore," I said, 'because the tragic poets are wise, they par? don us, and all those who have regimes resembling ours, for not admit? ing them into the regime
