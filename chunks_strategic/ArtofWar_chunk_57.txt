after the first roll of the enemy�s drums, when Ts�ao said: "Not just yet." Only after their drums had beaten for the third time, did he give the word for attack. Then they fought, and the men of Ch�i were utterly defeated. Questioned afterwards by the Duke as to the meaning of his delay, Ts�ao Kuei replied: "In battle, a courageous spirit is everything. Now the first roll of the drum tends to create this spirit, but with the second it is already on the wane, and after the third it is gone altogether. I attacked when their CHAPTER 8. MANEUVERING 66 spirit was gone and ours was at its height. Hence our victory." Wu Tzu (chap. 4) puts "spirit" first among the "four important influences" in war, and continues: "The value of a whole army�a mighty host of a million men�is dependent on one man alone: such is the influence of spirit!"] a commander-in-chief may be robbed of his presence of mind. [Chang Yu says: "Presence of mind is the general�s most important asset. It is the quality which enables him to discipline disorder and to inspire courage into the panic- stricken." The great general Li Ching (A.D. 571- 649) has a saying: "Attacking does not merely consist in assaulting walled cities or striking at an army in battle array; it must include the art of as- sailing the enemy�s mental equilibrium."] 1. Now a soldier�s spirit is keenest in the morning; [Always provided, I suppose, that he has had breakfast. At the battle of the Trebia, the Romans were foolishly allowed to fight fasting, whereas Hannibal�s men had breakfasted at their leisure. See Livy, XXI, liv. 8, lv. 1 and 8.] by noonday it has begun to flag; and in the evening, his mind is bent only on returning to camp. 1.

Disciplined and calm, to await the appearance of disorder and hubbub amongst the enemy:�this is the art of retaining self-possession. 3. To be near the goal while the enemy is still far from it, to wait at ease while the enemy is toiling and struggling, to be well-fed while the enemy is famished:�this is the art of husbanding one�s strength. 4. To refrain from intercepting an enemy whose banners are in perfect order, to refrain from attacking an army drawn up in calm and confident array:� this is the art of studying circumstances. 5. It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy, nor to op- pose him when he comes downhill. 6. Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight; do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen. 7. Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy.
