Soc- ratesbecomes argumentative. Instead ofencouraging theoldman in hislaudable intentions, Socrates asmuch astellshimthathedoes not knowwhat justice isandthereby undermines hislife.This isoneofthe most decisive moments ofthedialogue, for,with hisquestion, Socrates takescommand ofthe littlecommunity, forces Cephalus toleave, and makes thenature ofjustice theproblem ofthediscussion. Socrates acts asthough Cephalus hadtried todefine justice andobjects tothedefini- tionhehimself constructs outofCephalus' statement. Justice, ac- cording toSocrates' rendition ofCephalus' view, istelling thetruthand paying one's debts. Socrates' procedure isquite strange. Inthe first place hesaysnothing about halfofwhat interests Cephalus: hedoesnot mention piety, whether this isbecause hethinks Cephalus' understand- ingofpiety isadequate orbecause heisnotinterested inpiety. Sec- ond, inhisdiscussion ofpaying one's debts, Socrates issilent about thegodsandthesacrifices owed tothem. Inaword, Socrates forgets thedivine, which isCephalus' prime preoccupation, andmakes the discussion oneconcerning human justice alone. This, along with hisun- willingness tofacethefactthathemight beignorant ofthevery obliga- tionshe istrying sc?hard tomeet, iswhat causes Cephalus toleave. While thediscussion isgoing on,heiselsewhere performing sacrifices tothegods, concerned withwhat isforgotten inthat discussion. Socrates' objection isvery simple. Everyone knows that itisjust [314 ] Interpretive Essay topayone's debts, buteveryone isalsoaware thatthere areoccasions whenoneneednotandshould notdoso.Thus, itisimpossible, without contradicting oneself, tosaythat justice ispaying one's debts. One must seek anoncontradictory definition ofjustice. Cephalus, too, is aware thatonemustsometimes deviate from theprinciples ofjustice in thename ofjustice, buthehasnever considered what theconsequences ofthat fact are.Hemust adhere tothelaws,human anddivine, orhe would have tospend histime infinding outwhat justice israther than indoing it.Ifeveryone hadtodecide whether thelawsproperly apply ineach case that arises, thepolitical result would beanarchy; and, in- dividually, ataskbeyond thecapacities andenergies ofmostmen would beimposed onthem. ForCephalus thejust isidentical tothelaw ofthecity,andthelaw isprotected bythegods.Theproblem ofjustice issimply expressed inhisview: ifthere arenogods, there isnoreason tobejustortoworry; ifthere are,wemust simply obey their laws, for that iswhat they wish.Butcommon sense tellsusthatlaws arenotal- ways conducive tothegood ofthose they areintended tobenefit. Cephalus, however, iscontent toforget this fact inhissacrifices, even though hisactions maybeharming others. Hislighthearted piety canseem extreme selfishness. Heleaves tohissonthecon- sideration ofwhat istrulygood forother men, for itwould force him tomake adistinction between thejustandthe legal.Andhe leaves toallthoughtful selfish men theconsideration ofwhat the profitable lifewould beifthere arenopunishments after death. The unity ofthings expressed intheidentification ofthejustand thelegalunder theprotection ofthegods hasbeen rentasunder by Socrates' simple objection toCephalus' assertion that aman should pay hisdebts.Now themembers ofthisgroup must trytofindout what justice isandwhether justice isgood forthemanwho practices it. Although the definitions ofjustice proposed byCephalus, Polemarchus, andThrasymachus are allfound wanting andmust beabandoned, thediscussions concerning them arenotsimply critical nor istheir result only negative. From each something is learned which isoftheessence ofpolitical lifeandwhich isreflected inthefinal definition andtheregime thatembodies it. From Cephalus welearn that formostmen justice canmean only law-abidingness, andthatrewards andpunishments inthis lifeand ttie next arenecessary toinsure obedience which does notseem tothem desirable initself. Cephalus' definition failsbecause itcannot account forthose instances inwhich one isadmittedly exempted fromobeying [315 ] THEREPUBLIgI thelaw.Hehasnograsp oftheintention orprinciple oflaw.JJp^ believes inthesanctity ofprivate property: injustice istakingwhat belongs toothers; justice, respecting what belongs tothem. Belonging isdefined bythelaw.Butinsanity andtheintention toinjure aresuffi- cientgrounds fortaking away from amanwhat isthought tobelongto him.

Xhe simple example oftheinsanemanwhodemands thereturn ofhisweap- on, ifgeneralized, leads farfrom theletter ofthelaw,whichmen like Cephalus must respect. Itbecomes Polemarchus' responsibility toex-
