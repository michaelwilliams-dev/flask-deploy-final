(595a-608b) With theconfrontation ofthephilosopher andthe tyrant, thediscussion appears tohave reached itsend,butSocrates oncemore raises thesubject ofpoetry. This issurprising, and itis difficult toseewhyweshould return tothistopic after thelengthy discussion ofitinBook HI.That treatment, however, dealt onlywith theusesanddisadvantages ofpoetry intheeducation ofthewarriors, menwhoneeded courage andthesalutary taleswhich would encourage it.Homer istheteacher oftheGreeks, andhistitletothatrolemustbe examined. Intheearlier discussion. Homer's hero, Achilles, wasthe theme; inthisdiscussion. Homer himself isthetheme. The light tone adopted bySocrates here, theeasewithwhich heapparently dismisses poetry, must notcause onetoforget thatheistaking itvery seriously indeed. Poetry istheopponent, andthere isanancient quarrel between itandphilosophy. Homer isread orlistened tobyalltheGreeks; he speaks ofallthings intheir interrelations, andhetells ofthegods. Homer andtheother great poets constitute therespectable tribunal [426] Interpretive Essay before which philosophy istried. Socrates isafraid ofbeing denounced tothem, asthough theywere thelaw;andinasense theydoreflect that lawanddetermine theopinions thatmake it.However, BookXat- tempts toreverse thissituation. Socrates begins bymaking anapology tothepoets andendsbyopening theway forthem tomake anapology tohim. Socrates does notwish todestroy poetry; heonlywishes to judge it,rather thanbejudged by it. Theother themes ofBookXhelp toclarify thegrounds forthis final consideration ofpoetry. Theimmortality ofthesoulandthe rewards ofjustice arealso discussed, particularly therewards after death. Moreover, BookXculminates inapoetic myth; afterappearing toreject poetry, Socrates uses ittodescribe thecosmos andthefateof man, thebroadest possible objects ofhuman discourse. Poetry is necessary toSocrates' project ofreforming Glaucon, but itmustbea newkind ofpoetry, onewhich cansustain Glaucon inalifeofmoral virtue andrespect forphilosophy. Itisnot,then, thatpoetry mustbe entirely banished butthat itmustbereformed. BookXbegins with a criticism ofHomeric poetry andends with anexample ofSocratic poetry.

Thecosmos orchaos ofpre-Socratic poetry contained nosupport foreither themoral or theoretical life.TheRiverOcean which surrounds Homer's world isa thing ofconstant, meaningless change. Poetry, takenonitsownground, portraying those subjects onwhich itcanbest reveal itspowers, cul- minates inthehero Achilles. And itisAchilles whobemoans hisfate andasserts hispreference forserfdom onearth tothekingdom overthe dead.

Menneed poetry, butthekind ofpoetry which nourishes their soulsmakes allthedifference intheirunderstanding of their nonpoetic lives. Socrates outlines anewkind ofpoetry which leadsbeyond itself, which does notpresent man's only alternatives as tragic orcomic, which supports thephilosophic life.Hegives theprin- ciplewhich Aristotle developed inthePoetics, andwhich isembodied intheworks ofmensuch asDante andShakespeare.
