receiving them into his soul, he would be reared on them and become a gentleman. He would blame and hate the ugly in the right way while he's still young, before he's able to grasp reasonable speech. And when reasonable speech comes, the man who's reared in this way would take most delight in it, recognizing it on account of its being akin?" "In my opinion, at least," he said, "it's for such reasons that there's rearing in music." "Then," I said, "just as we were competent at reading only when the few letters there are didn't escape us in any of the combinations in which they turn up, and we didn't despise them as not needing to be d. 80 l noticed in either small writing or large, but were eager to make them out everywhere, since we wouldn't be skilled readers before we could do so-" "True.ï¿½ "Now isn't it also true that if images of writings should appear somewhere, in water or in mirrors, we wouldn't recognize them before we knew the things themselves, but both belong to the same art and discipline?" "That's entirely certain;" "So, in the name of the gods, is it as I say: we'll never be 402 b musical-either ourselves or those whom we say we must educate to be c guardians-before we recognize the forms of moderation, courage, liberality, magnificence, and all their kin, and, again, their opposites, everywhere they tum up, and notice that they are in whatever they are in, both themselves and their images, despising them neither in little nor big things, but believing that they all belong to the same art and discipline?" "Quite necessarily," he said. "Then," I said, "if the fine dispositions that are in the soul and d those that agree and accord with them in the form should ever coincide in anyone, with both partaking of the same model, wouldn't that be the fairest sight for him who is able to see?" "By far." "Now the fairest is the most lovable?" "Of course." "It's the musical man who would most of all love such human beings, while if there were one who lacked harmony, he wouldn't love him." "No, he wouldn't," he said, "at least if there were some defect in the soul. If, however, there were some bodily defect, he'd be patient and would willingly take delight in him." "I understand," I said. "You have, or had, such a boy and I con? cede your point. But tell me this: does excessive pleasure have anything in common with moderation?" "How could it," he said, "since it puts men out of their minds no less than pain?" "But, then, with the rest of virtue?" "Nothing at all." "But with insolence and licentiousness?" "Most of all." "Can you tell of a greater or keener pleasure than the one con? nected with sex?" "I can't," he said, "nor a madder one either." [ 81 ] e 403 a 403 a b C "Is the naturally
