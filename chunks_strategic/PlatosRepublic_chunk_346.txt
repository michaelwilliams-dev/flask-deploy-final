the wildest thoughts of that same comic poet who had also ridiculed philosophy. Book V is preposterous, and Socrates expects it to be ridiculed. It provokes both laughter and rage in its contempt for convention and nature, in its wounding of all the dearest sensibilities of masculine pride and shame, the family, and statesmanship and the city. As such it can only be understood as Socrates' response to his most dangerous ac? cuser, Aristophanes, and his contest with him. In the Ecclesiazusae Aristophanes had attacked the public in the name of the private, and in the Clouds he had attacked philosophy in the name of poetry. Here Soc? rates suggests that, if philosophy rules, the political can triumph over the private life. If he is right, he can show that Aristophanes did not understand the city because he did not understand philosophy, and he did not understand philosophy because he did not understand that philosophy could grasp the human things and particularly the city. The Republic is the first book of political philosophy, and attempts to show that.philosophy can shed light on human things as no other discipline can. Socrates is the founder of the city in speech and, hence, of po? litical philosophy. In Book V he tries to show the superiority of the philosopher to the comic poet in deed; he does so by producing a com? edy which is more fantastic, more innovative, more comic, and more profound than any work of Aristophanes. Socrates with an air of ut- ï¿½ most seriousness undertakes absurd considerations; in this he is already comic. If what he appears to teach seriously is impossible, as will prove to be the case, Socrates' comedy will be akin to the Ecclesiazusae. In that play the women of Athens try to institute what is just but politically impossible, and thereby they create ridiculous situations; Soc? rates surpasses them by radicalizing their proposals. If the perfection of the city cannot comprehend the perfection of the soul, the city will look ugly in comparison to the soul's beauty and be a proper subject of comedy; its pretensions will be ludicrous. Such a comedy will be a di? vine comedy, one calling for a more divine laughter. Only philosophy could produce it, for, as Socrates will explain, only philosophy has the true standard of beauty. In appearing. to disagree with Aristophanes about the city, Socrates shows that only he knows the true grounds of its inadequacy. Plato believes that his Socrates can argue better about man than Aristophanes, and that his arguments can culminate in better comedies. If this proves to be true, the total superiority of Socrates and his way of life will be manifest. Socrates proposes that women should have the same education and way of life as the men; there should be a full equality of the sexes, and they must, as it were, share the same locker room. Socrates is aware that poets will laugh at this proposal and that it will be
