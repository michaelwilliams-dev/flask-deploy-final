Turkey are that not being called inbythe Princes ofthe realm one cannot hope for arebel- lion from those around the Sultan toaid the enterprise .This isbe- cause ofwhat was said above the subalterns are all tied and obligated tothe Sultan and are more difficult tocorrupt .Even if they are corruptible ,they are oflittle use because they can't hold the people behind them for the same reason .Whoever attacks Turkey must expect tomeet aunited front .He has torely onhis own powers and not the disorder ofhis foe . But once having broken the enemy inthe field ,sothat no more armies can be formed ,the attacker has nothing toworry about except the bloodline ofthe Prince .Once that isextin- guished ,there isno one else tofear — noone else holds the es- teem ofthe populace .Just ashehad nothing tohope ofthe minis- ters before victory ,hehas nothing tofear from them afterwards . The opposite istrue ofcountries that are ruled like France .It iseasy toinsinuate oneself into the realm by gaining the alle- giance ofaBaron .One always finds malcontents and those who want reform .These interests can help one gain access and ease the victory .But afterwards itisinfinitely difficult tocontrol them both those who have helped and those who were opposed .Itis not enough toextinguish the bloodline ofthe King because other lords remain who head up new groups .Not being able tosatisfy orextinguish them ,anew Prince loses that state assoon asthe situation changes .

HOW TO GOVERN CITIES OR PRINCIPALITIES WHICH ,BEFORE OCCUPATION , LIVED ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN LAWS Inthe case ofoccupied states that have been used toliving Iwith their own laws inliberty ,there are three modes ofhold- ing them :first ,toruin them ;second ,go live personally in them ;third ,letthem live according totheir laws while extracting tribute and creating afaithful oligarchy that will keep the state friendly .Such an oligarchy knows that the Prince created the state and
