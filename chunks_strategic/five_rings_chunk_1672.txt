By1814 Napoleon’s powerhad crumbled and allied forces finally conqueredhim. The next governmentwas arestoration ofthemonarchy,intheform ofKing Louis XVIII, brother ofLouis XVI. Fouché, his nose alwayssniff- ingtheairforthenext social shift, knew Louis would notlastlong—he had none ofNapoleon'sflair. Fouché once again playedhiswaiting game, lying low, staying awayfrom thespotlight.Sure enough,inFebruary of1815, Napoleon escaped from theisland ofElba, where hehad been imprisoned. Louis XVIII panicked:Hispolicies had alienated thecitizenry,who were clamoring forNap0leon’sreturn. SoLouis turned tothe one man who could maybe have saved hishide, Fouché, theformer radical who had sent hisbrother, Louis XVI, totheguillotine, but was now one ofthe mostpop- ular andwidely admired politiciansinFrance. Fouché, however, would not side with aloser: Herefused Louis’srequest forhelpbypretendingthat his helpwasunnecessaiy—by swearing thatNapoleonwould never return topower (althoughheknew otherwise). Ashort time later, ofcourse, Napoleonand his new citizenarmywere closing inonParis. Seeinghisreignabout tocollapse, feelingthat Fouché hadbetrayed him, and certain that hedid not want thispowerful and able man on Napoleon’s team, King Louis ordered theIni.n.ister’s arrest and execution. On March 16,1815, policemensurrounded Fouché’s coach on aParis boulevard. Was thisfinallyhisend? Perhaps,but notimmediately: Fouché told thepolicethat anexvmember ofgovernment could notbearrested on the street. Theyfellforthestoryand allowed him toretum home. Later that day, though, theycame tohishouse and once again declared him under arrest. Fouché nodded—but would theofficers be sokind asallow a gentlemantowash and tochange hisclothes before leavinghishouse for thelast time? They gave their permission, Fouché lefttheroom, and the minutes went by.Fouché did not return. Finallythepolicemenwent into thenext room—where theysaw aladder againstanopen window, leading down tothegardenbelow. Thatdayand thenext thepolicecombed Paris forFouché, butbythen Napoleon’scannons were audible inthedistance and thekingand allthe king’smen had tofleethecity.As soon asNapoleonentered Paris, Fouché came outofhiding. Hehad cheated theexecutioner once again. Napoleon greeted hisformer minister ofpoliceandgladlyrestored him tohisold post. During the 100daysthatNapoleonremained inpower,until Water- loo, itwasessentiallyFouché who governedFrance. Alter Napoleon fell, Louis XVIII returned tothethrone, and like acatwith nine lives, Fouché stayedontoserve inyetanother goVemment—by then hispower and in- fluence hadgrownsogreatthat not even thekingdared challengehim. Interpretation In aperiodofunprecedented turmoil, JosephFouché thrived throughhis masteryofthe artoftiming. Heteaches usanumber ofkeylessons. First, itiscritical torecognizethespiritofthe times. Fouché always looked two steps ahead, found the wave that wouldcarryhim topower, androde it.You must alwayswork with thetimes, anticipate twists and turns, and never miss theboat. Sometimes thespiritofthetimes isobscure: Recognizeitnotbywhat isloudest and most obvious init,butbywhat lies hidden and dormant. Look forward todieNapoleons ofthefuture rather thanholdingontotheruins ofthepast. Second, recognizingtheprevailingwinds does notnecessarilymean runningwith them.
