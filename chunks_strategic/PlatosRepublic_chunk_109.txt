into flame, and once it's come to light, confirm it for ourselves." "The way to proceed is as you say," he said, "and it must be done." "Then," I said, "is that which one calls the same, whether it's big? ger or smaller, unlike or like in that respect in which it's called the same?" "Lik:e," he said. 434 b C d e 435 a "Then the just man will not be any different from the just city b with respect to the form itself of justice, but will be like it." "Yes," he said, "he will be like it." "But a city seemed to be just when each of the three classes of [ 113 ] 435 b C d e 436 a b natures present in� it minded its own business and, again, moderate courageous, and wise because of certain other affections and habits of these same classes." "True," he said. "Then it's in this way, my friend, that we'll claim that the single man-with these same forms in his soul-thanks to the same affections as those in the city, rightly lays claim to the same names." "Quite necessarily," he said. "Now it's a slight question about the soul we've stumbled upon, you surprising man," I said. "Does it have these three forms in it or not?" "In my opinion, it's hardly a slight question," he said. "Perhaps, Socrates, the saying that fine things are hard is true." "It looks like it," I said. "But know well, Glaucon, that in my opinion, we'll never get a precise grasp of it on the basis of pro? cedures22 such as we're now using in the argument. There is another longer and further road leading to it. But perhaps we can do it in a way worthy of what's been said and considered before." "Mustn't we be content with that?" he said. "It would be enough for me to present." � "Well, then," I said, "it will quite satisfy me too." "So don't grow weary," he said, "but go ahead with the considera? tion." "Isn't it quite necessary for us to agree that the very same forms and dispositions as are in the city are in each of us?" I said. "Surely they haven't come there from any other place. It would be ridiculous if someone should think that the spiritedness didn't come into the cities from those private men who are just the ones imputed with having this character,23 such as those in Thrace, Scythia, and pretty nearly the whole upper region; or the love of learning, which one could most im? pute to our region, or the love of money, which one could affirm is to be found not least among the Phoenicians and those in Egypt."24 "Quite so," he said. "This is so, then," I said, "and not hard to know." "Surely not." "But this now is hard. Do we act in each of these ways as a result of the same part of ourselves, or are there
