have lost both their reputations and their states. HOW AS A PRINCE TO AVOID BEING DESPISED AND HATED have mentioned the most important qualities for a Prince but Iwant now to be a little more specific: how, namely, the Prince should avoid that which makes him hateful or scorned, and how. If does this, should not worry about his reputation he he otherwise. The fastest way to become hated is to be rapacious and take the property or women of your subjects. This, the Prince has to avoid. Men left to their possessions and honor live contentedly. All one needs then is to guard against the ambitions of a few. It is easy and there are many ways to hinder them. must guard He against being lackadaisical, effeminate, and pusillanimous. Ir.resolute. Above all the Prince needs to guard against irresolute.ness. He should cultivate greatness, liveliness, gravity, and strength. In relations with his subjects, they should know that his judgment is irreversible.

One of the first ways of avoiding plots is to be loved by the masses. Those who plot against the Prince reckon on pleasing the populace. If they are afraid of offending the people, they no longer have the courage to follow this path, because the obstacles faced by con.spirators are endless. There have been many plots, but few have succeeded. Who plots cannot be alone nor can he seek out anyone except malcontents. As soon as you share a secret with a malcon.tent, you give him ammunition to be content because he can gain advantage by informing. Since he sees an immediate advantage in informing, he must either be an awfully good friend or hate the Prince awfully in order to keep faith. In short, the conspirators have to deal with fear, jealousy, and possible punishment, while on his side the Prince has majesty of the Principality, the laws, his friends and
