"Such," Isaid, "asdidn't exist inthetime ofAsclepius, asIsup- e pose. 1infer thisfrom thefactthat atTroy hissons didn't blame the woman whogave thewounded Eurypylus Pramneian wine todrink 406a with agreat dealofbarley andgrated cheese sprinkled on it;and it's [84 ] Bookin/404d-407a socrates/glauco justthese thatarethought tobeinflammatory; nordidthey criticize 406 Patroclus whowasheaHng."^^ "But forallofthat," hesaid, "thedrink iscertainly strange for oneinthatcondition." "No, itisn't," Isaid, "ifonlyyourecognize that thiscurrent artof medicine which isaneducation indisease wasnotusedbytheAscle- piads offormer times, orsothey say, until Herodicus came onthe scene.Hewas agymnastic master andbecame sickly; so'hemixed gymnastic with medicine, andhefirstandforemost worried himself todeath, thenmany others afterwards." "Inwhatway?" hesaid. "Hedrew outhisdeath," Isaid."Attending themortal disease, he wasn't able tocure it,Isuppose, andspent hiswhole lifetreating it withnoleisure foranything else,mightily distressed ifhedeparted abit from hisaccustomed regimen. So,finding ithard todie,thanks tohis wisdom, hecame toanoldage." "Well," hesaid, "thatwasafineprize^^ hewon forhisart." "Such asisfitting," Isaid, "foronewho didn'tknow that itwasn't from ignorance orinexperience inthisform ofmedicine thatAsclepius didn't reveal ittohisoffspring, butrather because heknew that forall menobedient togood laws acertain jobhasbeen assigned toeach in thecityatwhich heiscompelled towork, andnoonehastheleisure to besickthroughout lifeand treat himself. It'slaughable thatwe recognize thisforthecraftsmen, while fortherichandreputed happy wedon't." "How's that?" hesaid. "Acarpenter," Isaid,"when he's sick, thinks fittodrink some medicine from thedoctor andvomit uphisdisease orhave itpurged outfrom below, orsubmit toburning orcutting andberidofit.If someone prescribes alengthy regimen forhim, putting bandages around hisheadandwhat goeswiththem, hesoon says thathehas noleisure tobesicknor isalifethus spent—paying attention toa disease while neglecting thework athand— ofany profit. And, with that,hesaysgoodbye tosuch adoctor and returns tohisaccus- tomed regimen; regaining hishealth, helivesminding hisown busi- ness; ifhisbody isinadequate tobearing upunder it,hediesand is ridofhistroubles." "For thiskind ofman atleast," hesaid, "it'sthought proper to usemedicine inthisway." "Is it,"Isaid,"because hehadadefinite job,and ifhecouldn't do 407 1 it,itwould beofnoprofit togoonliving?" "Plainly," hesaid. [85 ] socrates/glaucon therepublic 407a "While therichman, asweclaim, hasnosuch jobathand that makes hislifeunlivable ifhe'scompelled tokeepaway from it." "Atleast there's notsaid tobe." "That," Isaid, "isbecause you don't listen tohow Phocylides^'^ says thatwhen someone already hasalivelihood he must practice virtue." "I,formypart," hesaid,"suppose hemust alsodosobefore that." "Let's notfight withhimabout that," Isaid. "But let's instruct ourselves astowhether therichmanmust practice itandwhether life is b unlivable fortheonewho doesn't practice it,orwhether care of sickness isahindrance inpaying attention tocarpentry andtheother arts,butdoesn't hinder Phocylides' exhortation." "Yes, byZeus," hesaid, "this excessive care ofthebody, ifit's overandabove gymnastic, hinders itjustabout more than anything. And it'stroublesome inthemanagement ofahousehold, onacam- paign, and insedentary offices inthecity." "Butmost important ofall,surely, isthat italsomakes anykind c oflearning, thought, ormeditation byoneself hard; itisalways onthe lookout fortensions andspinning intheheadandholds philosophy to blame. Sothatwherever virtue ispracticed andmade toundergo scru- tinyinthisway, thiscareofthebody isineveryway ahindrance. Ital- waysmakes onesuppose he'ssickandnever cease totakepains about ,hisbody." "Quite likely," hesaid.
