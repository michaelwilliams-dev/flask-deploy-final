Mao Tkevtung. 18934976 KEYS TOPOWER The human animal isdistinguished byitsconstant creation offorms. Rarely expressingitsemotions directly, itgivesthem form throughlan- guage,orthrough socially acceptablerituals. We cannot communicate our emotions without aform. The forms that wecreate, however, change constandymin fashion, in style,inallthose human phenomena representingthemood ofthe mo- ment. We areconstantly alteringtheforms wehave inherited fromprevi- ousgenerations, and these changesaresigns oflifeandvitality. Indeed. the thingsthat don’t change,theforms thatrigidify,come tolook touslike death, and wedestroythem. Theyoung show this most clearly:Uncom- fortable with theforms thatsociety imposes upon them, havingnosetiden- tity,they play with their own characters, tryingon avariety ofmasks and poses toexpress themselves. This isthevitalitythat drives the motor of form, creatingconstant changesinstyle.

Theproblemcomes later, when they often growconservative andposses- sive. Theynolongerdream ofcreatingnew forms; their identifies are set, their habits congeal,and their rigidity makes themeasy targets. Everyone knows their next move.

Human creations evolve toward abstraction, toward beingmore rnen~ taland less material. This evolution isclear inart,which, inthiscentury, made thegreat discoveryofabstraction andconceptualism; itcan also be seen inpolitics, which over time have become lessovertly violent, more complicated, indirect and cerebral. Warfare andstrategytoohave followed thispattern. Strategy beganinthemanipulationofarmies onland, posi— tioningthem inordered forrnations; onland, strategyisrelativelytwo di- mensional, and controlled bytopography.But allthegreat powershave eventuallytaken tothe sea, forcommerce and colonization. And toprotect their trading lanes theyhave had tolearn how tofight atsea.Maritime war- fare requirestremendous creativityand abstract thinking, since thelines areconstantly shifting.Naval captains distinguishthemselves bytheir abil» itytoadapttotheliteral fluidity oftheterrain and toconfuse theenemy with anabstract, hard—to—ant:icipate form.
