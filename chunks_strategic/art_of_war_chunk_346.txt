the ears of the whole world, and there is nothing you will not hear. Think with the minds of the whole land, and there will be nothing you do not know. If you are lazy even when you see there is good to be done, when you are hesitant even though the time is right, if you persist in something knowing it is wrong, this is where the Way halts. When you are flexible and calm, respectful and serious, strong yet yielding, tolerant yet firm, this is where the Way arises. When duty prevails over desire, this results in flourishing; when desire prevails over duty, this results in perishing. When seriousness prevails over laziness, this results in good fortune. When laziness prevails over seriousness, this results in destruction. Earlier mention was made of the so-called six defenses listed in the Six Strategies, which are analogous to Sun Wu�s parameters for leadership. These �six defenses� are actually qualities and capabilities of capable commanders: humaneness, justice, loyalty, trustworthiness, courage, and strategy. The Six Strategies also lists ways of choosing people for these six defenses: Enrich them and see if they refrain from misconduct, in order to prove their humaneness. Ennoble them and see if they refrain from hauteur, in order to prove their sense of justice. Give them responsibilities and see if they refrain from autocratic behavior, in order to prove their loyalty. Employ them and see if they refrain from deceit, in order to prove their trustworthiness. Endanger them and see if they are unafraid, in order to prove their courage. Burden them and see if they are unflagging, in order to prove their strategic approach to problems. The principles of order elucidated in the Six Strategies are, like the principles of leadership, forerunners of the concepts of organization utilized by both Sun Wu and Sun Bin. Some of the most powerful of these are the diagnostic principles by which defects in a system can be identified. Among these are the so-called Six Robbers and Seven Destroyers. The Six Robbers are: Officials who build huge mansions and estates and pass their time in entertainment, to the detriment of the integrity of leadership. Workers who don�t work, but go around getting into others� business, disrupting order. Officials who have cliques that obscure the good and wise and thwart the enlightened. Ambitious officers who independently communicate with leaders of other outfits, without deference to their own leaders. Executives who disregard rank and look down on teamwork, and are unwilling to go to trouble for employers. Strong factions who overpower those who are weak and lacking in resources. The Seven Destroyers are: Those who lack intelligent tactical strategy but are pugnacious and combative out of ambition for rewards and titles. Self-contradicting opportunists, pretenders who obscure the good and elevate the bad. Those who put on the appearance of austerity and desirelessness in order to get something. Those who pretend to be eccentric intellectuals, putting on airs and looking on the world with aloof contempt.
