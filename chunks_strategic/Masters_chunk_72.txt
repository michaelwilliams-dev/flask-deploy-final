a knack for imitation, and soon he was creating verses in dozens of different styles, always tweaking them a little with his own voice. Several years into this process, Keats came to a fateful decision�he would devote his life to writing poetry. That was his calling in life and he would find a way to make a living at it. To complete the rigorous apprenticeship he had already put himself through, he decided that what he needed was to write a very long poem, precisely 4,000 lines. The poem would revolve around the ancient Greek myth of Endymion. �Endymion,� he wrote a friend, �will be a test, a trial of my Powers of Imagination and chiefly of my invention ��by which I must make 4000 lines of some circumstances and fill them with Poetry.� He gave himself a rather impossible deadline�seven months�and a task of writing fifty lines a day, until he had a rough draft. Three-quarters of the way through, he came to thoroughly hate the poem he was writing. He would not quit, however, willing his way to the end, meeting the deadline he had set. What he did not like about Endymion was the flowery language, the overwriting. But it was only by means of this exercise that he could discover what worked for him. �In Endymion,� he later wrote, �I leaped headlong into the Sea and thereby became better acquainted with the Soundings, the quicksands and the rocks, than if I had stayed upon the green shore and � took tea and comfortable advice.� In the aftermath of writing what he considered to be a mediocre poem, Keats took stock of all of the invaluable lessons he had learned. Never again would he suffer from writer�s block�he had trained himself to write past any obstacle. He had acquired now the habit of writing quickly, with intensity and focus� concentrating his work in a few hours. He could revise with equal speed. He had learned how to criticize himself and his overly romantic tendencies. He could look at his own work with a cold eye. He had learned that it was in the actual writing of the poem that the best ideas would often come to him, and that he had to boldly keep writing or he would miss such discoveries. Most important of all, as a counterexample to Endymion, he had hit upon a style that suited him� language as compact and dense with imagery as possible, with not a single wasted line. With these lessons in hand, in the years 1818 to 1819, before he became gravely ill, Keats would produce some of the most memorable poems in the English language, including all of his greatest odes. This added up to perhaps the most productive two years of writing in the history of Western literature�all of it set up by the rigorous self-apprenticeship he had put himself through. By nature, we humans shrink from anything that seems possibly painful or overtly difficult. We bring this
