his the good or not position to learn how to not be good, and to use use it according to the needs. So, never mind the imaginary Prince. Let's talk about real ones. All men, and particularly Princes, who are raised above them, display qualities, which draw praise or blame. Some are to considered liberal, others miserly (the Tuscan term, not say avaricious � which implies rapaciously taking what belongs to others, while miserly means not spending what one already has). Some are considered generous, others avaricious, some cruel, others compassionate, some faithless, others faithful, some ef.feminate, others pusillanimous, some humane, others proud, some lascivious, others chaste, some loyal, others astute, some 88� Niccol� Machiavelli hard, others soft, some somber, others lighthearted, some reli.gious, others non-believers � on. and so I know people will say it would be praiseworthy for a Prince to possess all those above qualities that are considered good.
