"Exactly," hesaid. "Therefore, imitation, anordinary thing having intercourse with what isordinary, produces ordinary offspring." "Itseems so." "Does this," Isaid, "apply only totheimitation connected with thesight oralso tothatconnected with thehearing, which wename poetry?" "Itislikely," hesaid, "that itapplies alsotothis." "Well, then," Isaid, "let's notjust trust thelikelihood based on painting; but let'snowgodirectly tothevery part ofthought with ^ which poetry's imitation keeps company andseewhether itisordinary orserious." [286] BookX/602d-604b glaucon/socrates "Wemust." 603c "Let's present itinthisway. Imitation, wesay,imitates human beings performing forced orvoluntary actions, and, asaresult ofthe action, supposing themselves tohavedone wellorbadly, and inallof thisexperiencing pain orenjoyment. Was there anything elsebeyond this?" "Nothing." "Then, inallthis, isahuman being ofonemind? Or,justaswith respect tothesight therewasfaction andhehadcontrary opinions in d himself atthesame timeabout thesame things, isthere alsofaction in himwhen itcomes todeeds anddoeshedobattle with himself?

"Rightly," hesaid. "Yes, itwas right," Isaid."Butwhatwethen leftout, itisnow necessary togothrough, inmyopinion." e "What wasthat?" hesaid. "Adecent man," Isaid,"who gets ashissharesome suchchance aslosing asonorsomething elseforwhich hecares particularly, aswe were surely alsosaying then, willbear itmore easily than other men." "Certainly." "Now let'sconsider whether hewon't begrieved atall,orwhether this isimpossible, butthathewillsomehow besensible inthefaceof pain." "The latter," hesaid, "iscloser tothetruth." "Now tellmethisabout him.Doyousuppose he'll fight thepain 604a andholdoutagainst itmorewhen heisseenbyhispeers, orwhen heis alone byhimself inadeserted place?"

"Isn't itargument andlawthat tellhim tohold out,while thesuf- fering itself iswhat draws him tothepain?" h True. "When acontradictory tendency arises inahuman being about thesame thing atthesame time,wesaythatthere arenecessarily two things inhim." "Undeniably." [287 ] socrates/gi^ucon theREPUBLIq 604h "Isn't theoneready tobepersuaded inwhatever direction thelaw leads?" "How so?" "Thelawpresumably saysthat itisfinest tokeep asquiet aspossi- bleinmisfortunes andnotbeirritated, since thegoodandbadinsuch things aren't plain, nordoes taking ithard getoneanywhere, norare c anyofthehuman things worthy ofgreat seriousness; andbeing inpain isanimpediment tothecoming ofthatthing thesupport ofwhich we need asquickly aspossible inthese cases." "What doyoumean?" hesaid. "Deliberation," Isaid, "about what hashappened.
