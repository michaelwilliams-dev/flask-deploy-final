may extricate ourselves from misfortune. [Tu Mu says: "If I wish to extricate myself from a dangerous position, I must consider not only the enemy�s ability to injure me, but also my own ability to gain an advantage over the enemy. If in my counsels these two considerations are properly blended, I shall succeed in liberating myself.... For instance; if I am surrounded by the enemy and only think of effecting an escape, the nervelessness of my policy will incite my adversary to pur- sue and crush me; it would be far better to encourage my men to deliver a bold counter-attack, and use the advantage thus gained to free myself from the enemy�s toils." See the story of Ts�ao Ts�ao, VII. ss. 35, note.] 10. Reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage on them; 1. CHAPTER 9. VARIATION IN TACTICS 72 [Chia Lin enumerates several ways of inflicting this injury, some of which would only occur to the Oriental mind:�"Entice away the enemy�s best and wisest men, so that he may be left without counselors. Introduce traitors into his country, that the government policy may be rendered futile. Fo- ment intrigue and deceit, and thus sow dissension between the ruler and his ministers. By means of every artful contrivance, cause deterioration amongst his men and waste of his treasure. Corrupt his morals by in- sidious gifts leading him into excess. Disturb and unsettle his mind by presenting him with lovely women." Chang Yu (after Wang Hsi) makes a different interpretation of Sun Tzu here: "Get the enemy into a position where he must suffer injury, and he will submit of his own accord."] and make trouble for them, [Tu Mu, in this phrase, in his interpretation indicates that trouble should be make for the enemy affecting their "possessions," or, as we might say, "as- sets," which he considers to be "a large army, a rich exchequer, harmony amongst the soldiers, punctual fulfillment of commands." These give us a whip-hand over the enemy.] and keep them constantly engaged; [Literally, "make servants of them." Tu Yu says "prevent the from having any rest."] hold out specious allurements, and make them rush to any given point. [Meng Shih�s note contains an excellent example of the idiomatic use of: "cause them to forget PIEN (the reasons for acting otherwise than on their first impulse), and hasten in our direction."] 11. The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy�s not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable. 12. There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general: (1) Recklessness, which leads to destruction; ["Bravery without forethought," as Ts�ao Kung analyzes it, which causes a man to fight blindly and desperately like a mad bull. Such an oppon- ent, says Chang Yu, "must not be encountered with brute force, but may be lured into an
