pains and pleasures and desires and fears. If you wish I'm willing to compare it to what I think it's like." "But I do wish." "Don't you know," I said, "that the dyers, when they want to dye wool purple, first choose from a1l the colors the single nature belonging to white things; then they prepare it beforehand and care for it with no 428 e 429 a b C C 429 d little preparation so that it will most receive the color; and it is only e then that they dye? And if a thing is dyed in this way, it becomes color? fast, and washing either without lyes or with lyes can't take away its color. But those things that are not so dyed-whether one dyes other colors or this one without preparatory care-you know what they be? come like." "I do know," he said, "that they're washed out and ridiculous." "Hence," I said, "take it that we too were, to the extent of our power, doing something similar when we selected the soldiers and 430 a educated them in music and gymnastic. Don't think we devised all that for any other purpose than that-persuaded by us-they should receive the laws from us in the finest possible way like a dye, so that their opinion about what's terrible and about everything else would be color? fast because they had gotten the proper nature and rearing, and their dye could not be washed out by those lyes so terribly effective at scour? ing, pleasure-more terribly effective for this than any Chalestrean b. soda14 and alkali; and pain, fear, and desire-worse than any other lye. This kind of power and preservation, through everything, of the right and lawful opinion about what is terrible and what not, I call courage; and so I set it down, unless you say something else." "But I don't say anything else," he said. "For, in my opinion, you regard the right opinion about these same things that comes to be without education-that found in beasts and slaves-as not at all lawful15 and call it something other than courage." b. "What you say," I said, "is very true." ï¿½ "Well, then, I accept this as courage." "Yes, do accept it, but as political courage,"16 I said, "and you'd be right in accepting it. Later, if you want, we'll give it a still finer treatment. At the moment we weren't looking for it, but for justice. For that search, I suppose, this is sufficient." "What you say is fine," he said. "Well, now," I said, "there are still two left that must be seen in b. the city, moderation and that for the sake of which we are making the whole search, justice." "Most certainly." "How could we find justice so we won't have to bother about moderation any further?" "I for my part don't know," he said, "nor would I want it to come to light before, if we aren't going to consider moderation any further.
