all the others you ask about." "And what about the many doubles? Do they look any less half than double?" "No."" "And, then, the things that we would assert to be big and little, light and heavy-will they be addressed by these names any more than by the opposites of these names?" "No," he said, "each will always have something of both." "Then is each of the several manys what one asserts it to be any more than it is not what one asserts it to be?" "They are like the ambiguous jokes at feasts," he said, "and the c. children's riddle about the eunuch, about his hitting the bat-with what and on what he struck it.4ï¿½ For the manys are also ambiguous, and it's not possible to think of them fixedly as either being or not being, or as both or neither." "Can you do anything with them?" I said. "Or could you find a finer place to put them than between being and not to be? For pre? sumably nothing darker than not-being will come to light so that some? thing could not be more than it; and nothing brighter than being will c. come to light so that something could be more than it." "Very true," he said. "Then we have found, as it seems, that the many beliefs41 of the many about what's fair and about the other things roll around42 somewhere between not-being and being purely and simply." "Yes, we have found that." [ 160] "And we agreed beforehand that, if any such thing should come to light, it must be called opinable but not knowable, the wanderer be? tween, seized by the power between." "Yes, we did agree." "And, as for those who look at many fair things but don,t see the fair itself and aren,t even able to follow another who leads them to it, and many just things but not justice itself, and so on with all the rest, we,ll assert that they opine all these things but know nothing of what they opine." "Necessarily," he said. "And what about those who look at each thing itself-at the things that are always the same in all respects? Won,t we say that they know and don,t opiner, "That too is necessary." "Won,t we assert that these men delight in and love that on which knowledge depends, and the others that on which opinion depends? Or don,t we remember that we were saying that they Jove and Jook at fair sounds and colors and such things but can,t even endure the fact that the fair itself is something?" "Yes, we do remember." "So, will we strike a false note in calling them ]overs of opinion rather than lovers of wisdom? And wi1l they be very angry with us if we speak this way?" "No," he said, "that is, if they are persuaded by me. For ifs not ]awful to be harsh with whaf s true." "Must we, therefore, call philosophers rather than ]overs of
