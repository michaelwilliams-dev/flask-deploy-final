a whole, the bearing of the body, and everything else of the sort. Or don't you think so?" "I do." "But to set them down as laws is, I believe, foolish.9 Surely they [ 102] don't come into being, nor would they be maintained, by being set down as laws in speech and in writing." "How could they?" "At least it's likely, Adeimantus," I said, "that the starting point of a man's education sets the course of what follows too. Or doesn't like always call forth like?" "Of course." "Then, I suppose we'd also say that the final result is some one complete and hardy thing, whether good or the opposite." "Of course," he said. "That," I said, "is why I for one wouldn't go further and un? dertake to set down laws about such things." "That's proper," he said. "And, in the name of the gods," I said, "what about that market business-the contracts individuals make with one another in the market, and, if you wish, contracts with manual artisans, and libel, in? sult, lodging of legal complaints, and the appointment of judges, and, of course, whatever imposts might have to be collected or assessed in the markets or harbors, or any market, town, or harbor regulations, or anything else of the kind-shall we bring ourselves to set down laws for any of these things?" "It isn't worth-while," he said, "to d ctate to gentlemen. Most of these things that need legislation they will, no doubt, easily find for themselves." "Yes, my friend," I said, "provided, that is, a god grants them the preservation of the laws we described before." "And if not," he said, "they'll spend their lives continually setting down many such rules and correcting them, thinking they'll get hold of what's best." ï¿½ "You mean," I said, "that such men will live like those who are sick but, due to licentiousness, aren't willing to quit their worthless way of life.,, "Most certainly." "And don't they go on charmingly? For all their treatment, they get nowhere, except, of course, to make their illnesses more com? plicated and bigger, always hoping that if someone would just recom? mend a drug; they will be-thanks to it-healthy." "Yes," he said, "the affections of men who are sick in this way are exactly like that." "What about this?" I said. "Isn't it charming in them that they believe the greatest enemy of all is the man who tells the 425 b C d e 426 a 426a b C d e 427 a b truth-namely, that until one gives up drinking, stuffing oneself, sex and idleness, there will be no help for one in drugs, burning, or cutting, nor in charms, pendants, or anything of the sort." "Not quite charming," he said. "Being harsh with the man who says something good isn't charming." "You are not," I said, "as it seems, a praiser of such men." "No, indeed, by Zeus." "Therefore, if, as we were just saying, the city as a
