Hisdefinition oftherulers "intheprecise sense" ispartofhisprofes- sional propaganda. [330 ] Interpretive Essay Inthediscussion ofthis definition oftherulerwho isaperfect knower ofanart,weseethatThrasymachus isnotmerely alover of gain.He isalso, inhisway, alover ofknowledge. He isamodel ofthat notuncommon phenomenon, "the intellectual." Hispassions areinthe service ofthings other thanknowledge although hedevotes himself toa lifeofknowledge. Knowledge isnotpursued forthesakeofknowledge, butherecognizes acertain superiority inthe lifedevoted toknowing for itsown sake. Itisthiscontradiction that defeats him, fortaking knowledge seriously leadsbeyond preoccupation with one's private ad- vantage toward adisinterested lifedevoted touniversal concern. Thra- symachus' respect forartandreason enables Socrates totamehim,both because Thrasymachus iscompelled bytheargument asalessrational manwould notbewhen anargument goescounter tohispassions, and because heisintrigued bySocrates' artand skill.Even though hisargu- ments arenotalways simply good, Socrates manages togettheadvan- tageover thegreat rhetorician. This isanimpressive feat.The city, when confronted with Socrates, itself destroys him;Thrasymachus, charmed byhisarguments, finally becomes hisfriend. The intellec tual voice ofthecitycanbecome tractable asthecitynever will.The Republic, aXook about aperfect city, ischaracterized byhaving per- fect interlocutors, that is,men without whom acitycould notbe founded andwho are, atthesame time, persuadable, whom argument canconvince toadapt toanewkindofworld which iscontrary totheir apparent advantage. Justasonemusthave almost unbelievable condi- tions tofound thebest cityindeed, soonemusthave exceptional in- terlocutors tofound itinspeech. After Thrasymachus posits theprecise definition oftheruler, a definition which assumes thatruling isanartandthat artisagreat good, itisasimple matter forSocrates torefute—orrather tosilence —him. Thisargument isofparticular interest because itposes the problem ofjustice inamost radical form. Socrates proceeds toshow that allartsaredirected tosubject matters andthatthey areconcerned with those subject matters andnotM'ith themselves; allartsrulesome- thing, andtheyareinterested inthegood ofthething ruled.Thepracti- tioner ofanart,atleast intheprecise sense, doesnotserve himself; on thecontrary, heforgets himself completely. Thrasymachus' definition leads tothefurthest extreme from hisintention. Ifonewanted tohave acityofmenwhocared only forthepublic rather thantheprivate, one would onlyhave tofindawayofconstituting onepeopled byartisans in theprecise sense—which isjustthesolution oftheRepublic. Totheex- tent towhich aman isdevoted tohiscalling, heforgets hisown ad- vantage. [331 ] THEREPUBLIC Thrasymachus rebels attheconclusion towhich theargioment compels him; inattempting torefute it,hecites thewayoftheworld. Shepherds care fortheirsheep inorder thattheymaybeeaten, notin order tohavehappy sheep. Rulers lookonthepeople asshepherds do sheep: asobjects ofexploitation. Ashepherd wholooked tothegood of thesheepwould nothelpthembutwould onlyserve theappetites ofhis master. Similarly, themanwho cares forthepeople anddevotes him- selftothecommon good onlymakes thepeople fatter fortheexploita- tionofthecity's masters. Itismuch more reasonable fortheshepherd todeceive hismasters andeatthesheep himself ortomake himself the master. NowThrasymachus makes itexplicit thatjustice isbad fora manandthatthebestwayoflife isthemost unjust one— thetyrant's life.Hisindignation atSocrates' argument isunderstandable, sinceone mustwonder whoorwhat takes careoftheartisan-ruler who isalsoa human being andhasneeds andwishes ofhisown.Whywould hebe willing tobearuler? Thrasymachus isunable tofindananswer tothis question because hisown assertions havebound him. ItisSocrates himself who provides ananswer, although itis anenigmatic and ironic one. Reiterating thisprinciple that ashep- herd—or aruler- bydefinition cares fornothing buthisflock, Socrates adds that, since theartisan getsnothing forhimself from his art, hemustbepaid awage.Amanwhoearns awage is,according toSoc- rates, apractitioner ofthewage-earner's art;inpoint offact,every ar- tisan practices two arts—theonefromwhich hegets histitleandthe wage-earner's art.With thelatter arthecares forhimself; with thefor- mer, forothers. Wage earning, then, istherubric thatcovers thesideof aman's lifeconcerned with hispersonal advantage; hemust provide himself with thenecessities, andhepursues hisowngood aswell as thatofothers; heisnotaselfless servant. Thus anew art,andanewkind ofart,comes tolight. This art, however, contradicts thedefinition oftheartswhich hasbeen thebasis ofthediscussion. Thewage-earner's art isnotconcerned
