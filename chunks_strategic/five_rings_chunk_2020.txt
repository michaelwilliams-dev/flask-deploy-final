arerealonly insofar asthey "participate" inthe ideas. They arenotbutarelikewhat is.Hence thepractical menwho love particular things make themistake oftaking athing tobethat which itislike.They thusdream their livesaway, never laying hold of areality. Buttheycannot betold this.They must besoothed and deceived, and itisquestionable how fartheycanafford tobetolerant ofthephilosopher whose interests aresodifferent and conflicting. Here, again, poetry seems tobeintheservice ofthecharacteristic weakness ofthemany. Thus, inmentioning theunphilosophic men [394 ] Interpretive Essay who arelikethephilosophers, Glaucon chooses theexample ofthose who love theatrical spectacles. Poetry itself deals inimages ofpar- ticular things; and ituses itsimages togiveadded significance toone's particular attachments, beautifying one's country, one's loves, one's aspirations. Inthebeginning ofthediscussion Thrasymachus, the rhetorician, wasrefuted because hemade theerror ofsaying thata thing isthatwhich itislike.Andthediscussion ofimitation inBook IIIaddressed thissame question. Itisatheme which runsthroughout theRepublic. Poetry, initsmostcommon usage, adorns theparticular andrenders itmore attractive, hence making itmore difficult totrans- cend. Itdoes sobecause itmust appeal toaudiences ofmenwhocannot anddonotwish tomake thattranscendence. Itisthusanopponent of philosophy. Glaucon agrees that philosophers, since they areawake while others aredreaming andarelikepainters whocanusethetruth astheir model, would bethebestrulers iftheypossessed theother virtues. Soc- ratesresponds tothedoubt implied inGlaucon's condition byattempt- ingtoshow that allthevirtues areinvolved inthephilosophers' very vocation andthatthusthey aregood citizens. Asaresult oftheir love ofwisdom, allthelovers ofwisdom possess allthevirtues, andmore reliably thananyone elsebecause theyhave asufficient reason forbeing virtuous. They donothave tomake aneffort tobecome virtuous or concentrate onthevirtues; thevirtues follow ofthemselves from the greatest loveandpleasure ofthephilosophers. Inthecaseofothermen, asAdeimantus hasmade clear, everything theylovehastobesacrificed onthe altar ofvirtue. Byway ofcontrast, without sacrifice the philosopher, inaddition topossessing theintellectual virtues, willbe moderate, courageous, andjust.Atlastthere appears tobearesolution ofthedisharmony between happiness anddevotion tothecitythat arose afterthedestruction ofthecityofsows. Forthephilosophers con- stitute aclass ofmenwhocansafely bemade rulers andwhose hap- piness isidentical with their virtuous activity. However, thissolution maybemore apparent than real, for itis questionable whether thevirtues ofthephilosopher arequite thesame asthose ofthe citizen. One hasonly toconsider thecase ofthe philosopher's loveoftruth, which Socrates assimilates tothewarriors' truthfulness. Itisobvious thatamancanlovethetruth without telling itandcan also regularly tellwhat heunderstands tobethetruth without anylove fororquesting after thereal truth. Similarly, the philosopher's courage andmoderation arenotthesame asthose ofthe simple citizen. Thephilosopher iscourageous because hisconstant pre- occupation with theeternal makes himsomewhat oblivious tolife,and [395 ] THEREPUBLIC notbecause he is'obedient tothecity's rules about what isfearful and what not.Andheismoderate because hehasanimmoderate loveof thetruth, notbecause herestrains hisdesires. Most important ofall Socrates indicates thatthephilosopher isjustonlybyshoMdng that there arecertain kinds ofthings heislikely toabstain from. This isthe same procedure Socrates adopted inBookIVwhen hetried toprove thatamanwith ahealthy soul willbejust,andheadmitted there that this isonly acrude test.Thus thephilosopher islikely tobeindifferent tomoney because itplays only asmall roleinhelping himacquire what hecares for,butthere isnothing here thatindicates hehasadisposition torender unto others what isduetothem. Moreover, there isalsonoth- inginhisnature which would attach himtothecity.Socrates hints at thisbyrepeating acatalogue ofthephilosopher's virtues several times; thevirtues listed change slightly inthecourse ofthese repetitions. The most significant change isthat justice isfinally omitted (cf.487aand 494b). The silent lesson would seem tobethat itisindeed possible to possess intellectual virtue without what latercame tobecalled moral virtue. Theproblem appears tobesomething likethefollowing. Aspre- sented intheRepublic, thevirtues canbederived fromtwopossible sources: thenecessities ofthecityandthenecessities ofphilosophy. The virtues stemming from thesetwosources havemuch incommon, butthey arefarfrom identical. Nonetheless, Socrates' procedure isto identify thetwoandthus toassert thatthephilosopher isidentical with thevirtuous man inthecivic sense. Inthevery actofmaking thisques- tionable identification,
