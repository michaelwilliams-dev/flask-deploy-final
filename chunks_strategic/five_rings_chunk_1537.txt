Filippo Brunelleschi, thegreatRenaissance artist andarchitect, was a great practitionerofthe artofmakingothers come tohim asasign ofhis power.On one occasion hehad been engagedtorepairthedome ofthe Santa Maria delFiore cathedral inFlorence. The commission wasimpor- lam and prestigious.But when thecityofficials hired asecond man, Lorenzo Ghibem‘, towork with B1-unelleschi, thegreat artist brooded inse~ cret. Heknew that Ghiberti had gottenthejobthrough hisconnections, and that hewould donone ofthework andgethalf thecredit. Atacritical moment oftheconstruction, then, Brunelleschi suddenly developedamys- terious illness. Hehad tostop work, butpointedout tocity officials that theyhadhired Ghiberti, who should have been able tocontinue thework onhis own. Soon itbecame clear that Ghiberti was useless and theofiicials came begging toBrunelleschi. Heignored them, insisting that Ghiberti should finish theproject, until finally theyrealized theproblem: Theyfired Ghiberti. Bysome miracle, Bnmelleschi recovered within days.Hedidnothave tothrow atantrum ormake afool ofhimself; hesimply practiced theartof “makingothers come toyou.” Ifon one occasion you make itapoint ofdignitythat others must come toyou and you succeed, theywill continue todosoeven after you stoptrying.

Whenyou induceoppo- nents tocome toyou, then their force is always empty;aslongasyoudo not gotothem. your force isalways full.Attack ingemptinesswith fullness islikethrowing stones oneggs.
