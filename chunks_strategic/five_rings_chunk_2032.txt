devotes himself tospending itina variety ofpleasures. Buttheanti-democratic Adeimantus readily agrees thatoligarchy issuperior todemocracy; thus itappears, from his connection with theoligarchic regime, thattheoligarchic man isthe superior human type. This isobviously notanexhaustive account of themenunder consideration, but itserves Socrates' intention, which is tocondemn thetyrannic man.Todothis, thedesires mustbecon- demned, particularly theerotic desires. Thiscondemnation ofthe desires isthekeytotherankorder ofthemen— themore desire isdom- inant inthem, thelower they areonthescale. However, thisprinci- pleoforder isnotmanifest todesiring mensuch asGlaucon. Itisgiven plausibility bythefactthatinthecities selfish desire iswhatmost leads toinjustice. From astrictly political standpoint, thedenigration of desire isnecessitated; from thestandpoint ofanindividual whowants tobehappy, itisnotsoeasily accepted orseen tobenecessary. This hidden tension between thetwostandpoints ismost revealing andmust bewatched inthedescription which explicitly argues fortheirsame- ness.The similarity ofthe lifeofthecity tothat oftheman ac- tually diminishes inthedownward progress fromtimocracy totyranny. Thetimocratic man islargely devoted tothesame goals asthetimo- cratic cityandhisdescription islikethatofthecity,butthedemocratic manseems tobeable tolead aprivate lifeandhisdescription isquite different from thatofthecity.And, although allwould agree that a tyrannically ruled city istheunhappiest ofcities, itishardly clear that thetyrant istheunhappiest ofmen. Inatimocracy, asthecityfares, so fares theman. This isnotsoevidently thecase indemocracies and tyrannies. The order ofthe cities indignity andgoodness— timocracy, oligarchy, democracy, andtyranny— accords withAdeimantus' tastesand common sense, although itisnotinanywaydemonstrated. Follow- ingtheprinciples tacitly established intheRepublic, acitymust pro- vide forthesustenance ofthebody, beable todefend itself, andhave [417 ] THEREPUBLIG asrulersmenwho care forthecommon good.The cities' ranks seeni to correspond totheir capacity tomeet these conditions. Only aristocracy meets them fiiUy, buttimocracy comes closest tosodoing. Sparta, the model ofthetimocratic regime, isarepublic with along history of stability and isable todefend itsliberty courageously and skillfully. Al- though therulers secretly lustformoney, their loveofhonor protects their devotion tothepublic, andtheyaretooashamed tosacrifice their duty toacquisition. Moreover, iftheir courage isnotthat ofthe educated auxiliaries who areconvinced thatdeath isnothing terrible, and iftheyaresomewhat toosavage, itisundeniable thattheycanfight very well. Next inorder comes theoligarchic regime, which hasneither the perfect rulers ofthearistocratic regime northelove ofhonor, and hence thecourage, ofthetimocratic regime. Theoligarchs turn allof the city's resources totheir private gainandareboth unwilling and unable tofight. Buttheir continence andsobriety inacquiring and keeping property lend totheregime acertain stability. Because itlacks even thestability ofoligarchy, democracy comes fourth. Thedemocrats areincapable ofruling themselves, sotheymust choose leaders. These demogogues despoil therichfortheirown profit while trying tosatisfy thedemands ofthepoor. Finally, the city's property iswasted. Democracy isessentially atransitional regime because itsprinciple, freedom, doesnotencourage therespect forlawrequisite tothemain- tenance ofaregime. Itprepares theway fortyranny, admitted byallto betheworst ofregimes, theregime inwhich theruler exploits thecity simply forhispersonal benefit. Inhistreatment ofthedestruction ofthese regimes, Socrates sets down therulethataregime canbedestroyed onlybythevice intrinsic toitsprinciple. Oligarchy, forexample, because ofitsattachment to money, necessarily impoverishes vulnerable members ofitsown class andthus swells theranks ofthepoorwith able, disaffected men. This regime hastoencourage prodigality andhence sapspublic spiritedness. Oligarchy, inthisview, cannever beoverthrown byanunprovoked, surprise attack byamore powerful neighbor. Itsdownfall mustbea result ofitsown faults. This assertion ofSocrates isakin tohisin- sistence inBook IIIthatthesoul isthecause ofthebody's illness. The regime isthesoulofthecity,and itcauses everything thathappens in it;thusdomestic policy isallthatcounts. Socrates abstracts herefrom accident andparticularly from foreign policy. This serves tofocus at- tention onwhat ismost essential inthecity, itsvirtues; thesedepend entirely ontheregime, and itsgood character isthechief responsibility ofthestatesmen.
