the troubles of the new Prince. However, if you win the rebel people back a second time it is easier to hold on to the province. This is because the Prince, now aware of the rebelliousness, is less quick to punish delinquents, hold suspects, or to move against the weak. For France to lose Milan the first time in 1500 it only took Duke Lodovico rumbling around a little in the province, but to lose it the second time in 1511 it took the whole world against them, and France's armies, exhausted, fled to Italy. This happened because of what we said above. Whatever � both times Milan was taken back. I mentioned the reasons for first loss. It remains say the to 34� Niccol� Machiavelli what remedy France might have had and what a Prince in those circumstances might have done to prevent France's second loss. I should point out when one adds a new state to the old, either to it belongs the same province already and has the same lan.guage, or it doesn't. When it does, it is much easier to hold onto, especially if it is not accustomed to freedom. All it takes is to dis.rupt the dynastic line of former rulers, otherwise maintaining the old customs. If their customs are not disrupted, people will live on quietly. This was the case for Burgundy, Brittany, Gascony and Normandy, which stayed a long time with France. There is some variety of language but the customs are similar. They are to to easy integrate. Whoever acquires them needs only respect two things: one, that the bloodline of the dynasty is ended; two, not to alter the laws or fiscal system. That way the new province becomes quickly a part of the old one. When one acquires a province with another language, differ.ent customs, and different laws, then the trouble begins. It takes real good luck and much work to hold onto such a province. One way to do go so is for the Prince who acquires such a holding to and live there. This secures and preserves the new possession � as the Turks did when they took Greece into the Byzantine Em.pire, by moving to Constantinople. Despite observing a host of laws to hold onto that State, it would not have been possible had the Sultan not gone to live there. Being there, one sees disorders arise and can take quick measures against them. Not being there they get too big to remedy. It makes it easier too for provincial officials. They have fast and easy access to the Prince. If they are good, they will love him more; if they are bad, they will fear him the more. External enemies will respect the Principality the more because, with the Prince there, the Principality will be more diffi.cult to lose. to one or The other good solution is send colonists in two places and let them be part of the new state � otherwise one has to
