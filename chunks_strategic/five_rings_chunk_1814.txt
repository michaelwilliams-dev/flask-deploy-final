Since theof- ficeisancient, itisnotanew Principality, andthere arenone of thedifficulties ofanew Principality. Although thePrince himself isnew, theorders andoffices, which heenters, aretraditional, as ifhewere ahereditary ruler. Butreturning tooursubject, Isuggest thatanyone who fol- lows theabove discourse willseethateither hatred orscorn were thecauses ofdownfall ofthose emperors Imentioned. And one canseewhy some came toabadendandtheothers reached happy ends. ForPertinacius and Alexander, both being new Princes, itwasuseless andharmful toimitate Marcus, who wasa hereditary Prince. Carcalla, Commodius, andMassiminius should never have imitated Severius, nothaving thevirtue necessary to follow inhisfootsteps. AnewPrince inanewPrincipality cannot imitate Marcus, norshould hetrytodowhat Severius did.He should take those qualities ofSeverius necessary forfounding a state ofhisown andmixthem with theglorious qualities ofMar- cus,which arenecessary forconserving andmaintaining astate already onitsfeet. ONFORTS AND OTHER THINGS SOFEVERYDAY USE ORNOT TOPRINCES ome Princes, forreasons ofsecurity, have disarmed their subjects,encouraged othershostilehavefactions,partitioned otherstheirhaveterritory,sought otherstowinhave over suspect elements, others have built fortresses, stillother have torn them down. Although onecannot judge theadvisability ofsuch measures apart from theparticulars ofthose situations where they take place, nevertheless Iwillmake some generalities. Never hasanew Prince disarmed hissubjects. Often, Instead, hehasarmed them. Byarming them heappropriates their force —they areonhisside. Those who youarmbecome your faithful armed subjects andovercome your partisans since youcan’t arm them allyousubject those youdon't arm tothose youdoarm. Thediscrimination obliges those thatyoufavor tosupport you. Theothers excuse youbecause they respect those who take the riskandtheduty. You offend those whom youdisarm. They feel aloss ofyour faith inthem either from cowardice ordistrust. Suspicion ofeither increases their hatred. Because youmust be armed youhave toturntomercenaries, which areuntrustworthy, asIsaid above. Even ifthey arereliable, they arenotstrong enough todefend youagainst strong enemies orsuspect subjects. Therefore, asIsaid, anewPrince always setsupanarmy. His- torysupplies many examples. When aPrince adds anew member tohisoldstate, however, heshould disarm thenewstate, unless theywere allies before be- ingincorporated. Even these with time andopportunity should be neutralized. Thearms should berestricted toone's own soldiers in thatpartoftheoldstate thatisclose toyou. 110—Niccolò Machiavelli Ourforefathers, andthose reputed tobewise, held thatPis- tolabepartitioned andPisa occupied byforce. Tofacilitate this, they sowed division there inorder tomove more easily against them. Intimes ofabalance ofpower, thiswasfairly easy. ButI don’t think itissuitable today. Idon't think these divisions help anyone now —italways happens inadivided city that the weaker faction joins theenemy, theother can't hold, andthecity goes down todefeat. The Venetians, following these oldguidelines, encouraged theGuelfs andGhibellines intheir occupied cities. Although they avoided bloodbaths, they kept thefactions ateach other sothat citizens would bepreoccupied bytheir differences with each other andnotunited against theVenetians. This didnotwork. Defeated atVailate (1509), theVenetians were assailed byoneof thefactions andstripped oftheir state. Such methods seem to weaken thePrince. Inaproud Principality, such divisions arenot permitted. They areuseful during peace, butuseless during war. Without adoubt Princes wax great when they overcome the obstacles intheir path; anew Prince needs fortune andmaking a reputation ismore important tohimthan toahereditary Prince. Enemies make reputations forthePrince andthefeats against them, which heovercomes. APrince mounts bytheladder his enemies useagainst him. Asage Prince, some say,astutely culti- vates enemies when hecansothat, when heputs them down, his reputation increases. Sometimes aPrince andespecially new ones have
