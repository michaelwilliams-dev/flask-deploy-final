valleys means being close to water and fodder. Master Sun Watch the light, stay on the heights. When fighting on a hill, do not climb. This applies to an army in the mountains. DU MU One version says, �Fight going down, not climbing up.� Master Sun When cut off by water, always stay away from the water. Do not meet them in the water; it is advantageous to let half of them cross and then attack them. CAO CAO AND LI QUAN You induce the enemy to cross over. Master Sun When you want to fight, do not face an enemy near water. Watch the light, stay in high places, do not face the current of the water. This applies to an army on water.
