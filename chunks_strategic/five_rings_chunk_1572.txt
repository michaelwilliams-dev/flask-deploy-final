TRANSGRESSION OFTHE LAVV Ch’in Shih Huang Ti,thefirstemperor ofChina (221-210 B.C.), was the mightiestman ofhisday.Hisempirewas vaster and more powerfulthan that ofAlexander theGreat. Hehadconquered allofthekingdomssur- rounding his own kingdom ofChin and unified them into one massive realm called China. Butinthelastyears ofhislife,few,ifanyone,sawhim. Theemperor lived inthe most magnificent palace built tothatdate, in thecapital ofHsien-yang.The palace had 270pavilions;allofthese were connected bysecret underground passageways, allowingtheemperorto move through thepalacewithoutanyone seeinghim. Hesleptinadiffer-— entroom every night, andanyonewhoinadvertentlylaideyesonhim was instantlybeheaded. Onlyahandful ofmen knew hiswhereabouts, andif theyrevealed ittoanyone, they, too, were puttodeath. The firstemperorhadgrownsoterrified ofhuman Contact that when hehad toleave thepalacehetraveled incognito, disguising himself care fully.On one suchtripthrough theprovinces,hesuddenly died. Hisbody wasborne back tothecapitalintheemperor’s carriage, with acartpacked with salted fishtrailingbehind ittocoverupthe smell oftherotting corpse-—~noone was toknow ofhisdeath. Hedied alone, farfrom his wives, hisfamily,hisfriends, and hiscourfiers, accompanied only bya minister and ahandful ofeunuchs. Interpretation Shih Huang Tistarted off astheking ofCh’in, afearless warrior ofunbri- dled ambition. Writers ofthetime described him asaman with “awaspish nose, eyeslikeslits, thevoice ofajackal,and theheart ofatigerorwolf.” Hecould bemerciful sometimes, but more often he“swallowed menup without ascruple.” Itwasthrough trickeryand violence that heconquered theprovinces surroundinghis own and created China, forgingasinglena- tion and culture outofmany. Hebroke upthefeudal system,and tokeep aneyeonthemanymembers oftheroyal families that were scattered across therealm’s various kingdoms, hemoved 120,000 ofthem tothecap- ital, where hehoused the most importantcouxtiers inthe vast palace of Hsienyang. Heconsolidated themanywalls ontheborders andbuilt them into theGreat Wall ofChina. Hestandardized thecountry’s laws, itswrit- tenlanguage,even thesizeofitscartwheels. Aspartofthisprocessofunification, however, thefirstemperorout- lawed thewritings and teachings ofConfucius, thephilosopherwhose ideas onthemoral lifehadalreadybecome virtuallyareligion inChinese culture. OnShih Huang Ti’sorder, thousands ofbooks relatingtoConfu- cius were burned, and anyonewhoquotedConfucius was tobebeheaded. This made many enemies fortheemperor,and hegrew constantly afraid, even paranoid.The executions mounted. Acontemporary,thewriter Han- fei-tzu, noted that “Ch’in hasbeen victorious forfour generations, yethas lived inconstant terror andapprehensionofdestruction.” Astheemperor withdrew deeperanddeeperinto thepalacetoprotect'lHI.\lr\~t)l l-l.HI l'||l‘.
