In1751, when Madame dePompadourwas attheheight ofherpower, sheexperienced her worst crisis. Physically weakened bytheresponsibili— tiesofherposition, shefound itincreasingly difficult tomeet theking’sde~ mands inbed. This wasusuallythepointatwhich themistress would meet herend, strugglingtomaintain herpositionasherbeauty faded. But Madame dePompadourhad astrategy: Sheencouragedthekingtosetup akind ofbrothel, Pare auxCerfs, onthegrounds ofVersailles. There the middle-aged king could have liaisons with themost beautiful young girls in therealm. Madame dePompadourknew that hercharm and herpoliticalacu— men had made herindispensable totheking.
