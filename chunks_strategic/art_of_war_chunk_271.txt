Eventually they starved out the Sui army. Fatigue and Battle Liu Ji said: In warfare, if there is an advantageous position but the enemy has already occupied it, if you then head into battle there you will be fatigued and therefore suffer defeat at the hands of the enemy. The rule is �Those who are first on the battlefield and await opponents are at ease; those who are last on the battlefield and head into battle get worn out� (Sun Tzu, The Art of War, �Emptiness and Fullness�). After the civil wars of the Three Kingdoms period, the Jin dynasty was established, supplanting the victorious kingdom of Wei. The Jin dynasty lasted from 265 to 420, but it was challenged by a series of kingdoms ruled by non- Chinese peoples. These latter were called the Sixteen Kingdoms, and they were established by warlord-kings from among five Central Asian minorities who adopted elements of the cultures of East and South Asia in their rise to nationhood. In the early fourth century, a high minister of the Jin dynasty sent an army of more than one hundred thousand troops to attack one of these kingdoms, which was ruled by a race of people known in Chinese as Jie, descendants of the ancient Xiongnu Huns. The leader of the Jie intended to resist aggressively, but someone warned him, �The Chinese army is well trained and powerful; it is impossible to stand up to it. For now let us strengthen our defensive positions and thus �break their edge.� There is a difference in the power of attack and the power of defense; if we remain on the defensive for now we will gain complete victory.� But the Jie leader said, �The Chinese army has come from afar; the soldiers are physically exhausted and in a ragged and disorderly condition.

If we draw back now and the Chinese take advantage of our withdrawal to attack us once our army is in motion, it will be every man for himself�then how can we fortify our defensive position? What you are recommending is a way to self-destruction without even a fight.� And in the end the leader of the Jie killed the man who objected to aggressive defense against the Chinese. Now the Jie warrior-king appointed a vanguard commander and ordered that any laggards be executed. He set up a dummy force on top of a hill, then stationed two ambush forces on either side. The warrior-king personally led a brigade to meet the Chinese in battle, and then pretended to flee. The Chinese commander sent his men to chase the Jie warriors as they fled. Now hidden Jie ambushers rose up and attacked the pursuers. The Chinese were routed and had to retreat. Victory in Battle Liu Ji said: When you defeat enemies in battle, it will not
