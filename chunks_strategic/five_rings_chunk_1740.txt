tohandle, than toinitiate anew order ofthings. Niccolo ;’\/iachiavelli, I~f69«I 527 KEYS TOPOWER Human psychologycontainsmany dualities, oneofthem beingthat even while peopleunderstand theneed forchange, knowing how important itis forinstitutions and individuals tobeoccasionally renewed, theyarealso ir- ritated andupset bychangesthat affect them personally. They know that changeisnecessary,and thatnovelty providesrelief from boredom, but deep inside they clingtothepast. Changeintheabstract, orsuperficial change, they desire, but achange that upsetscore habits and routines is deeply disturbingtothem. Norevolution hasgone without apowerfullater reaction against it,for inthelongrun thevoid itcreatesprovestoounsettlingtothehuman ani- mal, whounconsciouslyassociates such voids with death and chaos. The opportunityforchangeand renewal seduces peopletotheside ofthe revo~ lution, but once their enthusiasm fades, which itwill, theyareleftwith a certain emptiness. Yearning forthepast, theycreate anopeningforitto creepback in. ForMachiavelli, theprophetwho preachesandbrings changecan onlysurvive bytaking uparms: When the masses inevitably yearn forthe past,hemust bereadytouseforce. Butthearmed prophet.cannot lastlong unless hequicklycreates anew setofvalues and rituals toreplacetheold ones, and tosoothe theanxieties ofthose who dread change. Itisfareasier, and lessbloody,toplayakind ofcongame. Preach changeasmuch asyou like, and even enactyour reforms, butgive them thecomforting appear- ance ofolder events and traditions. Reigningfrom A.D. 8toAD. 23,theChineseemperor Wang Mung emerged from aperiod ofgreathistorical turbulence inwhich thepeople yearnedfororder, anorder representedforthem byConfucius. Some two hundredyears earlier, however, EmperorCh’in had ordered thewritings ofConfucius burned. Afewyears later, word hadspreadthat certain texts hadmiraculously survived, hidden under thescholar’s house. These texts maynothave been genuine, butthey gave Wanghisopportunity: Hefirst confiscated them, then had hisscribes insertpassagesinto them that seemed tosupportthechanges hehad been imposingonthecountry. When hereleased thetexts, itseemed that Confucius sanctioned Wang’s reforms, and thepeople feltcomforted andaccepted them more easily.

They may have in stalled two consuls inplace oftheking, but since theking had been served bytwelve lictors, theyretained the same number toserve under the con- suls. The kinghadpersonally performedanannual sacrifice, in 9.great spectaclethat stirred thepublic; therepublic retained thispractice, only transferringittoaspecial“chief oftheceremony,whom theycalled the Kingofthesacrifice.” These and similargestures satisfied thepeopleand keptthem from clamoring forthemonarchy’sreturn.

Science claims asearch fortruth that would seem toprotectitfrom conservatism and theirrationalityofhabit: Itisaculture ofinnovation. Yet when Charles Darwinpublishedhisideas ofevolution, hefaced fiercerope positionfrom hisfellow scientists than from religiousauthorities. Histheo- rieschallengedtoomany fixed ideas. JonasSalk ran into the same wall with hisradical innovations inimmunology,asdidMax Planck with his revolutionizingofphysics.Planck later wrote ofthescientific oppositionhe faced, “Anew scientific truth does nottriumph byconvincing itsopponents andmakingthem seethelight. butrather because itsopponents eventually die,and anew generation grows upthat isfamiliar with it.” The answer tothis innate conservatism istoplaythecourtier’sgame.
