error byseeking tostrip Venice ofitsac- quired possessions. Hecould have brought theVenetians down if hehadnotaggrandized theChurch norputintheKing ofSpain. Buthaving done thisheshould never have humiliated theVene- tians, because they were powerful enough tokeep others outof Lombardy. The Venetians would never have letsomeone else intoLombardy unless theythemselves took itover, andtheothers would never have given ittoVenice after taking itfrom France, andgoing atitalone against them would nothave made sense. If someone saidthatLouis would have ceded Romagna toAlexan- derandItaly toSpain toavoid war, Iwould respond thatone should never getintoanimbroglio toavoid awarbecause itdoes- n'tsave you. Itjustmakes youvulnerable. Ifsomeone elsecites theloyalty thattheKing owed tothePope, toundertake allthisto resolve hismarriage andthepromises made over theArchbishop- ricofRouen, I'danswer with what follows about thefaith of Princes andhow itshould beobserved. SoLouis lostLombardy byignoring those guidelines men- tioned forthose who take andwant tokeep new territories. This isnothing special, justordinary andreasonable. Italked ofthisin Nantes with theArchbishop ofRouen when Iwas inFrance, when Valentine (aswecommonly called Caesar Borgia, sonof Pope Alexander) occupied Romagna. TheCardinal toldmethe Italians understood nothing ofwar, and Iresponded that the French understood nothing ofpolitics —otherwise theywouldn't have lettheChurch become sopowerful. Also itwasclear that thepower ofboth theChurch andSpain hadbeen caused by France —andFrance's ruinbythem. Onecandraw ageneral rule THE PRINCE —39 from this, which rarely fails —whoever helps someone elseto power getsruined. Thereason isthatittakes industry orforce to make someone powerful, andboth ofthese aresuspect inthe mind oftheonewho becomes powerful. REASONS WHY THE KINGDOM OF DARIUS ,WHICH WAS OCCUPIED BY ALEXANDER THE GREAT , DID NOT REBEL AGAINST HIS SUCCESSORS WHEN ALEXANDER DIED onsidering the difficulties ofacquiring new Principalities , Comeone can marvel athow Alexander the Great became the 'Lord ofAsia inafew years ,and ,having acquired anEm- pire ,soon after he died .Itwould seem logical that his Empire would revolt .As ifhis generals had noother difficulties than ,for reasons ofambition ,tobicker among themselves !My answer is that one must remember that Principalities are governed intwo different wayseither by aPrince whom allserve asministers who thanks toaconcession help togovern the realm ,orby a Prince and his Barons who ,not by appointment ,but byheredity , hold that rank .Such Barons have their own states and underlings who recognize and hold them inaffection .Those states that are governed byaPrince and his servants are centralized with more authority ,because nobody else inthe province isviewed asmore powerful orhigher .When they obey someone else itisonly asa minister orofficial and they hold noparticular affection for them . The examples ofthese two diverse methods ofgovernment today are Turkey and France .One Lord governs the whole mon- archy ofTurkey the rest are his servants .His realm isdivided into provinces ,orsanglaks .and hesends them administrators - changing and varying them ashewants .But the King ofFrance is situated inthe midst ofaphalanx ofhereditary lords ,recognized and appreciated by their subjects .They all have their preemi- 42- Niccolò Machiavelli nence and the King cannot remove them without risking danger . Whoever considers these systems will see that Turkey would be difficult to acquire but ,once won ,easy tohold .Vice -versa , France would be easy tooccupy but difficult tohold . The reasons itisdifficult tooccupy
