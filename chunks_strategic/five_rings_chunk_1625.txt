Rentingthe most splendid apartmentinthecityinto which hehad tem- porarily settled, hewould furnish itwith fabulous furniture and accessories, which hehadbeguntocollect. Hewould drive through thecityinacoach studded withjewels,with sixmagnificent black horses atitshead. He never stayedtoolonginoneplace,and when hedisappeared, sayinghehad more souls togather into hisflock, hisreputation only grew inhisabsence. Hebecame famous, althoughinfact hehad never done asingleconcrete thing. From allover Europe,theblind, thecrippled,and thedesperatecame tovisitBorri, forword hadspreadthat hehadhealing powers.Heasked no feeforhisservices, which onlymade him seem more marvelous, and in- deed some claimed that inthis orthatcityhehadperformedamiracle cure.

The Church continued topursue him, denouncing him forheresyand witchcraft, and Borzi’sresponseto these chargeswas adignified silence; thisonly enhanced hisreputationand made hisfollowers more passionate. Onlythegreatarepersecuted,after all;howmanyunderstood JesusChrist inhis own time? Born’ didnothave tosayaword—-his followers now called thePopetheAntichrist. And soBorri’spower grewandgrew, until onedayheleftthecityof Amsterdam (where hehad settled for awhile), abscondingwith hugesums ofborrowedmoneyand diamonds that had been entrusted tohim. (He claimed tobeable toremove theflaws from diamonds through thepower ofhisgifted mind.) Now he was onthe run. The Inquisition eventually caught upwith him, andforthelastMenty years ofhislifehewasimpris- oned inRome. But sogreatwas thebelief inhisoccultpowersthat tohis dying dayhewas visited bywealthy believers, including QueenChristina ofSweden. Supplyinghim udth money and materials, these visitors al- lowed him tocontinue hissearch fortheelusive philosopher’sstone. Interpretation Before heformed hiscult, Borri seems tohave stumbled on acritical dis- covery. Tiring ofhislifeofdebauchery, hehad decided togive itupand to devote himself totheoccult,agenuine interest ofhis. He must have no titted, however, that when healluded toamystical experience (rather than physical exhaustion)asthe source ofhisconversion, people ofallclasses wanted tohear more. Realizingthepowerhecould gainbyascxibingthe changetosomething external and mysterious, hewent further with his manufactured visions. Thegranderthevision, and the more sacrifices he asked for,the more appealingandbelievable hisstory seemed tobecome. Remember: Peoplearenotinterested inthetruth about change. They donotwant tohear that ithas come from hard work, orfrom anythingas banal asexhaustion, boredom, ordepression; theyaredyingtobelieve in something romantic, otherworldly. Theywant tohear ofangelsand out—of~ body experiences. Indulgethem.
