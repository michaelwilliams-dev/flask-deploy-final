Bydefeating the Middle Kingdom, theking ofWuwould instantlyraise hisstatus. The warbegan with greatfanfare and several victories, butitsoon boggeddown. Avictoryonone from would leave theWu armies vulnera~ ble onanother. Theking’schief minister andadviser, WuTzu-hsiu, warned him that thebarbarous state ofYueh, tothesouth, wasbeginningtonotice thekingdom ofV\’u’s problemsand haddesigns toinvade. Theking only laughedatsuch w0rries~one more bigvictory and thegreat Middle King— dom would behis. Intheyear 490, Wu T212-hsiu sent his sonawaytosafetyintheking- dom ofCh’i. Indoingsohesent thekingasignalthat hedisapproved of thewar, and that hebelieved theking’s selfish ambition wasleading Wu to min. Theking, sensing betrayal,lashed out athisminister, accusing him of alack ofloyalty and, inafitofanger, ordered him tokillhimself. Wu Tzu- hsiu obeyed hisking,butbefore heplungedtheknife into hischest, he cried, “Tear outmyeyes,ohKing, andfixthem onthegate ofWu, sothat I mayseethetriumphant entry ofYueh.” AsWuTzwlrsiu hadpredicted,within afewyearsaYueharmy passed beneath thegate ofWu. Asthebarbarians surrounded thepalace,theking remembered hisminister’s last Words-——~and feltthedead man’s disembod- iedeyes watching hisdisgrace.Unable tohear hisshame, thekingkilled himself, “coveringhisface sothat hewould nothave tomeet thereproaclr fulgaze ofhisminister inthenext world.” Interpretation The story ofWu isaparadigmofalltheempiresthat have come tominby overreachlng. Drunk with success and sickwith ambition, such empiresex‘ pandtogrotesque proportionsand meet amin that istotal. This iswhat happenedtoancient Athens, which lusted forthefarawayisland ofSicily and endeduplosingitsempire.The Romans stretched theboundaries of their empiretoencompassvast territories; indoingsotheyincreased their vulnerability,and thechances ofinvasion from yetanother barbarian tribe. Their useless expansion ledtheir empireinto oblivion. FortheChinese, thefateofthekingdom ofWu serves asanelemental lesson onwhathappenswhenyoudissipate your forces onseveral fronts, losing sight ofdistant dangers forthesake ofpresent gain. “Ifyouarenotin danger,” says Sun-tzu, “do notfight.” Itisalmost aphysicallaw: What is bloated beyonditsproportions inevitably collapses.The mind must not wander from goaltogoal,orbedistracted bysuccess from itssense ofpur- poseandproportion. What isconcentrated, coherent, and connected toits pasthaspower.What isdissipated, divided, and distended rots and falls to theground. Thebigger itbloats, theharder itfalls.

Mayer Amschel, thefirstoftheRothschilds toaccumulate wealth bylending money,inthe lateeighteenth century,well understood the powerthat comes from thiskind ofconcentration and cohesion. First, Mayer Amschel allied himself with onefamily, thepowerful princes ofThom und Taxis. Instead ofspreadinghisservices out, hemade himself these princes’ primary banker. Second, heentrusted none ofhis business tooutsiders, using onlyhischildren and close relatives. The more
