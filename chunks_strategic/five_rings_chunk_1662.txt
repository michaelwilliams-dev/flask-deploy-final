For thus 275 LAW 33Interpretation Catherine had seen very earlyonthesway that amistress has over aman ofpower: Her own husband, Henri II,hadkeptone ofthe most infamous mistresses ofthem all,Diane dePoitiers. What Catherine learned from the experiencewas that aman like herhusband wanted tofeel hecould win a woman over without havingtorelyonhisstatus, which hehad inherited rather than earned. And such aneed contained ahugeblindspot:Aslong asthe woman began theaffair byactingasifshehad beenconquered,the man would fail tonotice that asdine passedthemistress had come tohold powerover him, asDiane dePoitiers did over Henri. Itwas Catherine’s strategytoturn this weakness toheradvantage, using itasawaytoconquer and control men. Allshehad todowas unleash theloveliest women inthe court, her“flying squadron,”on men whom she knew shared her hus« ba.nd’s vulnerability. Remember. Alwayslook forpassionsand obsessions that cannot be controlled. The strongerthepassion,the more vulnerable theperson.This mayseem surprising,forpassionate peoplelookstrong.Infact, however, theyaresimply filling thestagewith their theatricality, distracting people from how weak and helpless they reallyare. Aman’s need toconquer women actuallyreveals atremendous helplessnessthat hasmade suckers outofthem forthousands ofyears. Look atthepartofapersonthat ismost visible—their greed, their lust, their intense fear. These arethe emotions theycannot conceal, and over which theyhave theleast control. And what peoplecannot control, youcancontrol forthem.

Because ofherhus- band’s fabulous wealth, artdealers courted her, butwith such condescen- sionthey obviouslysaw her asanupstart. Onlyone man ofconsequence treated herdifl’erently:thedealer JosephDuveen. Forthefirst fewyearsofDuveen’s relationshipwith Arabella, hemade noeifort tosellexpensivearttoher. Instead heaccompaniedher tofine stores, chatted endlesslyaboutqueensandprincessesheknew, onand on. Atlast, shethought,aman who treated her asanequal,even asuperior,in high society. Meanwhile, ifDuveen didnottrytosell arttoher, hedid sub- tlyeducate her inhisaesthetic ideas——n-amely,that the best at was the most expensiveart.And after Arabella had soaked uphiswayofseeing things, Duveen would act asifshealwayshadexquisite taste, even though
