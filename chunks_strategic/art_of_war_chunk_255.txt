general recommended the other Wu general, with whom he had had the foregoing conversation, saying, �He is a deep thinker and has the ability to bear responsibility. Considering his orderly thinking, I regard him as suitable for this important post. Furthermore, he is not yet well known, so the general of Shu doesn�t hate him. No one could be better. If you give him the job, have him conceal his actions outwardly while inwardly looking for opportunities to take advantage; then he can overcome the general of Shu.� So the king of Wu summoned the other general and promoted him.

As it happened, the waters of the Han River rose violently, enabling the Shu general to capture the leader of the Wei reinforcements, with a large contingent of infantry and cavalry. The Shu general sent his own troops shooting down the swollen river in boats to strike the Wei forces. Now at this time the puppet emperor of the dissolving Han dynasty had his temporary capital not far from the war zone. Cao Cao, the Wei warlord general who manipulated the puppet emperor, thought the capital was too close to enemy lines, and he wanted to move it out of reach. One of the great ministers of Wei, however, objected to Cao Cao�s plan. He said, �The reinforcements we sent were overcome by the river�it is not that they failed in defensive battle. As far as the overall policy of the state is concerned, nothing
