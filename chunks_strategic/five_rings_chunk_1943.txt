"Yes,byZeus," hesaid, "completely." "Well, then," Isaid, "let's take itlike thissothatwemaymore distinctly seewhatwewant." "How?" ^ "Intheargument let'sdivide thecityunder ademocracy intothree parts,which istheway itactually isdivided. Oneclass issurely thatwhich, d thankstothelicense, grows naturally initnoless than intheoligarchiccity." Thats so. "But it'sfarfiercer herethan intheother." "How's that?" "There, duetoitsnotbeing held inhonor butbeing driven from theruling offices, itiswithout exercise and isn'tvigorous. But ina democracy, presumably, this class, withfewexceptions, leads, and its fiercest partdoesthespeaking andtheacting, while therestalight near theplatform andbuzzanddon't endure themanwho saysanything else; theresult isthateverything, apart from acertain fewexceptions, e isgoverned bythis class insuch aregime."

"And thepeople wotild bethethird class, allthosewhodotheir 565a ovi^n work, don't meddle inaffairs, and don't possess verymuch. Whenever theyassemble, they constitute themostnumerous andmost sovereign class inademocracy."
