plainwhat standard should beloioked towhen onedeviates from the letter ofthelaw—which isequivalent tostating thepurpose forwhich laws areinstituted. {331d-336a) Polemarchus inherits hisfather's duty ofdefending thelawandhence ofdefending thatproperty which heisgoing to inherit. Hefails inhisattempt todefine justice inawaywhich iscon- sistent withthemaintenance ofprivate property, andtheRepublic culmi- nates intheelaboration*of aregime inwhich theonly title toproperty is virtue andwhich ishence communistic. Polemarchus' original intention when heinterrupted wasmerely tosupport his father's conten- tion thatoneshould paywhat isowed. Hedoes sobyciting the authority ofapoet. Inhiscase,however (asopposed tothatofCeph- alus), poetic authority apparently does notrefer totheeven greater authority ofthegods; heexpresses hisownview. Socrates can,with greater propriety, callintoquestion theopinions oftheyoung Polemar- chusbased ontheauthority ofSimonides than thedogmas ofthepious oldCephalus based ontheauthority ofthetraditions about thegods. ButevenhereSocrates doesnotcriticize theauthority; hemerely asks Polemarchus tointerpret. Socrates makes theironic assumption that Si- monides mustberightandthat, sinceheisright, hisviews must accord with theresults ofrational argument. Polemarchus iscompelled to learnhow toargue; this isthe firststepontheroadfrom unconditional acceptance oftheancestral order tothenewregime based onreason in which theauthority ofthe father's opinions andthepower ofhisprop- ertyplaynorole.Bytheendofhisdiscussion with Socrates, Polemar- chus isaware thathecannot gethelpfromSimonides andthathemust himself findreasons ifheistobesatisfied with hisbeliefs about justice. Finally heandSocrates join inagreeing thatSimonides could nothave saidwhatPolemarchus asserted hesaid, for itisunreasonable andbase. Simonides remains respectable, butonlybecause itisassumed thathe accepts theauthority ofPolemarchus andSocrates who arenow freeof [316] Interpretive Essay him.Polemarchus isthelastparticipant inthediscussion whoattempts touseanauthority asasufficient cause forbehef. Immediately after himcomes Thrasymachus with hisown definition ofjustice. Polemarchus insists that justice ispaying what oneowes, but Socrates again poses thesame objection thatsilenced hisfather. Inorder tosave hisdefinition Polemarchus must alter thesense ofowing.Now justice isnotgiving back toanymanwhathehasdeposited butgiving good things tofriends. Ingeneral thiswould mean following Cephalus' rule,but itaccounts fortheexceptions: oneneed notaidamanwho in- tends todoonedamage— hemustbeafriend; andonemust look tothe good oftheother party, asCephalus didnotdo.Two great themes emerge: friendship, orcommunity, and thegood— infinite themes which itnowbecomes necessary tounderstand ifonewishes tounder- stand justice. Polemarchus, ofcourse, doesnotrecognize what hashap- pened, forhedoesnotseeanyproblem inknowing what isgood fora friend. Socrates explains Polemarchus' definition ofjustice— doing good, andnoharm, tofriends—interms oftheexample heused toembarrass Cephalus. Athing isnotowed ifitworks harm torender it.ButSoc- rateschanges thething deposited inthiscase: itismoney, notaweap- on.This small change ismost revealing, for itbroadens thescope of theexceptions andchanges their sense. Cephalus would notreturn the weapon because itsowner might hurthimwith it;hisjustification isthe selfish oneofhisown defense; justice mustbepracticed until itis manifestly harmful tooneself. Money inthehands ofamadman isnot somanifestly dangerous toanother man as isaweapon. Ifone withholds hismoney, thejustification forsodoing isnotlikely tobe thathewillharm others butrather thathewillharm himself. Now the focus ofattention isonwhat itdoes totheonewhoreceives rather than totheonewho gives, aquestion towhich Cephalus wasprofoundly in- different. Cephalus wasinterested inwhat justice would profit himself, Polemarchus isinterested initsadvantage forothers. He isreallymuch more ofagentleman than hisfather. Hepresents theother sideofthe problem ofjustice— thegood itdoes thecommunity, asopposed tothe individual. The relation between justice conceived asone'sowngood andjustice conceived asthecommon good istheabiding concern ofthe Republic; Cephalus andPolemarchus represent thetwopoles. Also at thispoint, withtherecognition thataman's property inmoney only ex- tends sofarashecanusethatmoney well— only sofarasisgood for him— private property becomes radically questionable. Aftermore prodding bySocrates, Polemarchus isledtocomplete hisdefinition byassertingthat enemies areowed harm. Justice isbenefiting friends andharming enemies. This isPolemarchus' andthegentleman's [317 ] THEREPUBLIC view ofjustice. AsLessing approvingly put it,"fortheancient Greeks moral greatness consisted inaloveoffriends that isasconstant asthe hatred ofone's enemies isunchanging."
