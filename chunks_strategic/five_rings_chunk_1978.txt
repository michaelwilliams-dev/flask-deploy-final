Although Socrates finds this understanding ofjustice ultimately inadequate, heclearly agrees with Lessing that itistheformula forgentlemanly andheroic nobility and higher thanmost alternatives. Itsounds harsh toourears, for itisfar from themorality ofuniversal love towhichweareaccustomed, and wemustmake great efforts ifwearetounderstand itsdignity. That dignity consists inunswerving loyalty, loyalty tothe first,mostobvious attachments amanforms— loyalty tohisfamily andhiscity.Our ad- miration forthischaracter ismanifest inourhorror atthemanwho is willing tobetray family orfriends forgain, outoffear, oreven inthe pursuit ofanideal. Such loyalty seems natural, for itsprings upinus withour firstappetites andtastes; itisidentical withloveofouromti. It does nothave theabstract aspect oftheloveofahumanity which a mancannot know initsentirety, alovewhich doesnotmake distinc- tionsamong men. Itismore powerful because ofitsexclusiveness; it stays within thelimits ofpossible human concern. But,although many might bewilling toadmit that one's duties toward one'sown takeprecedence over those toward mankind at large, itmight wellbeaskedwhy itisnecessary toharm enemies, or whythereneedbeenemies atall.Theanswer istwofold. There areun- justmenwhowould destroy thegood things andthegood lifeofone's ownfamily ornation ifonedidnotrender them impotent. And,even though therewere notmenwho arenatively unjust, there isascarcity ofgood things intheworld. Thegood lifeofonegroup ofmenleaves other groups outside whowould like,andmayevenbecompelled, to takeaway thegood things ofthe firstgroup. Tohaveafamily oracity that isone'sownimplies thedistinction between insiders andoutsiders; andtheoutsiders arepotential enemies. Justice ashelping friends and harming enemies ispeculiarly apolitical definition ofjustice, and its dignity stands orfallswiththedignity ofpolitical life.Every nation has warsandmustdefend itself; itcanonlydosoifithascitizens whocare for itandarewilling tokillthecitizens ofother nations. Ifthedistinc- tionbetween friends andenemies, andtheinclination tohelpthefor- merandharm thelatter, were obliterated from theheart andmind of man, political lifewould beimpossible. This isthenecessary political definition ofjustice^ and itproduces itsspecific kindofhuman nobility expressed inthevirtue ofthecitizen. Socrates doesnotsimply reject it asheappears todo.Thewarriors inhisbestregime, whom hecom- pares tonoble dogs, share inthemost salient characteristic ofnoble [318 ] Interpretive Essay dogs: gentleness toward acquaintances andharshness toward strangers. This isthekeytothestrengths andweaknesses ofthepolitical man. Socrates' analysis ofthedefinition isdivided intothree parts: (1)a discussion ofhowonecandogood tofriends (332c-334b); (2)anat- tempt todefine afriend (334c-335b); and (3)acritique ofthenotion thatajustmancandoharm (335b-336a). Socrates begins byasserting thatSimonides meant thattheowed is the fitting. Thedeposit isnolonger important. Whether amanhas deposited something ornot isirrelevant; theonlyconsideration iswhat isfitting forhim. Justice might mean depriving himofwhathethinks belongs tohimorgiving himsomething towhich heappears tohaveno claim. Inthisreformulation, doing good tofriends andharm toene- mies isequivalent togiving toeachwhat isfitting. Polemarchus meant thatonegives tofriends thethings theywantanddenies toenemies the things theywant. Socrates changes Polemarchus' meaning byconcen- trating notonthewants ofmenbutonwhat isobjectively proper for them.Asickfriend isjustly treated when given medicine whether he likes itornot.This shift inemphasis implies thattheprimary concern ofthejustmanmustbesomething Polemarchus hasnever considered: what counts isnotsomuch thedisposition togivethegood things to friends, butknowing what thosegood things are.Justice mustbesome kind ofknowledge. Therefore Socrates turns tothemost evident, perhaps theonly sure,models ofknowledge ofwhat isfitting— thearts.Adoctor wishes togivewhat isfitting tobodies andknows what isfitting andhow to give it.The justman, ifheistosucceed inhisintention, must also possess anart.Now theproblem becomes toidentify theartofjustice which, toput itmildly, common sense doesnotapprehend soquickly asitdoes theother arts.Formally, itmustbetheartwhich givesgood tofriends andharm toenemies, just ascookery gives seasoning to foods. However, itimmediately comes tolight thatjustice isnottheonly artcapable ofbenefiting friends andharming enemies. Medicine and navigation areofeven greater usethan justice tomenwho aresickor sailing. Asamatter offact,each oftheartsaims atsome good, and hence each iscapable ofworking thebenefactions orinjuries called for bythedefinition ofjustice. Thequestion istofindwhat justice does thatnoother artdoes,andthis isobviously adifficult, or,rather, anim- possible, task.Polemarchus suggests
