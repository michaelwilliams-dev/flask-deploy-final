especially in matters of state, where certainty is so necessary, owing to the importance of the a.airs involved., Such men deserve to stand by the helm of state either as pilots or as men at the wheel. To Excel in what is Excellent. A great rarity among excellences. You cannot have a great man without something pre-eminent. Mediocrities never win applause. Eminence in some distinguished post distinguishes one from the vulgar mob and ranks us with the elect. To be distinguished in a Small post is to be great in little: the more comfort, the less glory. The highest eminence in great a.airs has the royal characteristic of exciting admiration and winning goodwill. Use good Instruments. Some would have the subtlety of their wits proven by the meanness of their instruments. 'Tis a dangerous satisfaction, and deserves a fatal punishment. The excellence of a minister never diminished the greatness of his lord. All the glory of exploits reverts to the principal actor; also all the blame. Fame only does business with principals. She does not say, "This had good, that had bad servants," but, "This was a good artist, that a bad one." Let your assistants be selected and tested therefore, for you have to trust to them for an immortality of fame. To be the First of the Kind is an Excellence, and to be eminent in it as well, a double one. To have the �rst move is a great ad-vantage when the players are equal. Many a man would have been a veritable Phoenix if he had been the �rst of the sort.

The skill of prodigies may �nd a new path to eminence, but prudence accompanies them all the way. By the novelty of their enterprises sages write their names in the golden book of heroes. Some prefer to be �rst in things of minor import than second in greater exploits. Avoid Worry. Such prudence brings its own reward. It escapes much, and is thus the midwife of comfort and so of happiness. Neither give nor take bad news unless it can help. Some men's ears are stu.ed with the sweets of �attery; others with the bitters of scandal, while some cannot live without a daily annoyance no more than Mithridates could without poison. It is no rule of life to prepare for yourself lifelong trouble in order to give a temporary enjoyment to another, however near and dear. You never ought to spoil your own chances to please another who advises and keeps out of the a.air, and in all cases where to oblige another involves disobliging yourself, 'tis a standing rule that it is better he should su.er now than you afterwards and in vain. Elevated Taste. You can train it like the intellect. Full knowledge whets desire and increases enjoyment. You may
