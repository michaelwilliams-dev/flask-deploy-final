non � anchor morto. Virtue will take arms against sound and fury Let the battle be brief For the ancient valor (from Italia Mia, by Francesco Petrarch 1304-1374) . TRANSLATOR�S NOTE In this edition, The Prince is the first English translation for a general everyman public. Originally composed in 1513, Machiavelli gifted it to Lorenzo de Medici, Duke of Urbino, who received it coldly. It was fi.nally published in 1532, posthumously, and quickly appeared on the church�s Index. Its first English edition appeared in 1640. The many historical editions and translations were published mainly for statesmen, princes, nobles, churchmen and kings; subse.quent editions were for scholars and special audiences. This edition is the first general, journalistic, readable translation that dispenses with scholarly footnotes and apparatus, incorporating the dates and brief attribution to the players within the text itself. For fur.ther information on the personages and period, any reader can easily go to the encyclopedia for more details. The Prince is famed as the first tract of modern political science, and Machiavelli as the father of modern political science. Hitherto, po.litical science had tended to be a rhetorical exercise based on the im.plicit assumptions of Church or Empire. Or like The Republic of Plato, the tracts of this kind had been about Utopias or the ways �aft bring about ideal societies�. Machiavelli thus was the first to found the sci.ence of modern politics on the actual study of mankind, and divorced politics as a science from ethics. It appeared in Italy at the height of the Renaissance, which powered humanism and the new free consciousness into the modern age. Machiavelli is widely seen as a forerunner. For the first time he based political observation on facts rather than on philosophical princi.ples. He emphasized practice, not theory. He raised strategy to impor.tance over theory and principle. He required theory to be balanced by the realities of weaponry, troops, and arms. He argued that Christianity had made values that outmoded antiquity but was the first to see the full divergence of State and Church. He argued that the mystique of virtue was a quality beyond good and evil, and that in real politics secular power needed to instrumental.ize the Church and be aware that was a political power, not just an it exceptional power of God. He posed man's virtue against the vagaries 138 � Niccol� Machiavelli of fortune; he stressed how the moment of decision needed to be fol.lowed up by planning and effort, and he foresaw how tumult becomes an opportunity for liberty. He was the first to factor �the voice of the populace� into political equations. Above all, he formulated the new prestige of the �State.� He dealt even in revolution � and, again, stressed that virtue was a force greater than good and evil. one sense, The Prince supersedes In Plato's Republic � the first tract political science in antiquity that of posed the problem of what the State should be.
