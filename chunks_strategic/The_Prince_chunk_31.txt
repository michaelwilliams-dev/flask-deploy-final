moreover, to please equals and other great citizens without hurting someone, but easier to help the populace. The interest of the populace is more honest than that prominent citizens who want com- of to of mand and oppress, while the populace only wants to be free oppression. On the other hand, an unfriendly populace is hard to 66� Niccol� Machiavelli manage because they are many, while, since prominent citizens are few, a Prince can manage them. is The worst a Prince can expect from the populace to be abandoned by them. But if the prominent few are against him not only may they abandon him but also they may conspire against him. They see more clearly and are themselves more astute, are to out save and advance themselves, and support whomsoever can win.

To be clearer, as to important personages � the noblemen � either they help in governage by their ways to favor the Prince's fortune, or they don't.

People, when they get something good where they expected something bad, admire their benefactor more, and the populace is even more favorable if the Prince can win this favor in many ways. Each no or Prince differs. There are rules certainties. So we will skip this. In conclusion: a Prince needs a friendly populace; otherwise, in adversity, there is no hope. Nabide (205 to 192 B.C.), Prince of the Spartans, survived the THE PRINCE � 67 blockade of all Greece and a victorious Roman army, and de.fended his homeland and state; surviving the original onslaught, he needed only to defend himself against a few enemies. If he had had the populace against him, this would not have sufficed. This is true despite those
