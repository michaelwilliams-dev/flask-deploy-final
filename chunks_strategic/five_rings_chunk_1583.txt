tion. Now Kissingeroffered tosupplytheNixoncamp with valuable inside information onthenegotiationsforpeaceinVietnam that were then going oninParis. Hehad aman onthenegotiatingteam keepinghim informed of thelatest developments.The Nixon team gladly acceptedhisoffer. Atthe same time, however, KissingeralsoapproachedtheDemocratic nominee, Hubert Humphrey,and offered hisaid. TheHumphrey people asked him forinside information onNixon and hesuppliedit.“Look,” Kissinger toldHurnphrey’s people, “I’ve hated Nixon foryears.” Infact he had nointerest ineither side. What hereally wanted was what hegot: the promise ofahigh-level cabinet post from both Nixon andHumphrey. Whichever man won theelection, Kissingefscareer was secure. The winner, ofcourse, wasNixon, andKissinger dulywent ontohis cabinet post.Even so,hewas careful never toappear toomuch ofaNixon man. When Nixon was reelected in1972, men much more loyaltohim thanKissingerwere fired. Kissingerwas also theonlyNixon highofficial to survive Watergate and serve under the next president, Gerald Ford. By maintainingalittle distance hethrived inturbulent times. Those who use this strategyoften notice astrange phenomenon: Peoplewho rush tothesupport ofothers tend togain littlerespectinthe process,fortheir helpissoeasily obtained, while those who stand back findthemselves besiegedwith supplicants.Their aloofness ispowerful, and everyonewants them ontheir side. When Picasso, after early years ofpoverty,had become themost suc- cessful aitist intheworld, hedid not commit himself tothis dealer orthat dealer, although theynow besiegedhim from allsides with attractive offers andgrand promises. Instead, heappearedtohave nointerest intheir ser- vices; thistechniquedrove them wild, and asthey foughtover him his prices onlyrose. When Henry Kissinger,asU.S.secretaryofstate, wanted toreach détente with theSoviet Union, hemade noconcessions orconcil- iatory gestures, butcourted China instead. This infuriated and also scared theSoviets——-theywere already politically isolated and feared further isola tion ifthe United States and China, ,ca.me together. Kissinger’smove pushedthem tothenegotiatingtable. The tactic has aparallelinseduction: Whenyouwant toseduce awoman, Stendhal advises, court her sister first. Stay aloof andpeoplewill come toyou.Itwill become achallenge for them towinyouraffections.
