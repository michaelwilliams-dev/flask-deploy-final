you. When you are weaker than your opponent, then you appear strong to impel the opponent to go away. Thus the movements of opponents all follow your direction. When you move opponents with the prospect of an advantage, since opponents are following you, you wait for them in ambush with well-prepared forces. WANG XI Whether you get opponents to follow you, or get them to take something, be sure you have crack troops ready for them first. Master Sun Therefore good warriors seek effectiveness in battle from the force of momentum, not from individual people. Therefore they are able to choose people and let the force of momentum do its work. LI QUAN When you have the force of momentum in war, even the timid can be courageous. So it is impossible to choose them for their capabilities and give them the appropriate responsibilities. The brave can fight, the careful can guard, the intelligent can communicate. No one is useless. MEI YAOCHEN It is easy to get people to act by means of the force of momentum, whereas it is hard to demand power in individual people. The able have to choose the right people and also let the force of momentum do its work. ZHANG YU The rule for delegation of responsibility is to use greed, use folly, use intelligence, and use bravery, allowing for the natural force of each one, not blaming people for what they are incapable of, but choosing appropriate responsibilities for them according to their respective capacities. Master Sun Getting people to fight by letting the force of momentum work is like rolling logs and rocks. Logs and rocks are still when in a secure place, but roll on an incline; they remain stationary if square, they roll if round. Therefore, when people are skillfully led into battle, the momentum is like that of round rocks rolling down a high mountain�this is force. DU MU Roll rocks down a ten-thousand-foot mountain, and they cannot be stopped� this is because of the mountain, not the rocks. Get people to fight with the courage to win every time, and the strong and the weak unite�this is because of the momentum, not the individuals. [ 6 ] Emptiness and Fullness DU MU Militarists avoid the full and strike the empty, so they first have to recognize emptiness and fullness in others and themselves. Master Sun Those who are first on the battlefield and await the opponents are at ease; those who are last on the battlefield and head into battle get worn out. JIA LIN Those who first position themselves in an advantageous place and await opponents there are prepared, so the troops are relaxed. If the opponents are in an advantageous position, then you should not go to them, but withdraw your troops to another base, making it appear that you will not oppose their army. Opponents will then think that you have no strategy, and will come and attack you. Then you can turn things around
