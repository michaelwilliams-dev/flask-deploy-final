In this case, theweak party involved was thepresident’s dog and theattack backfired-in thelong run, itonlymade thepresidentmore sympathetic, sincemany people willnaturallyside with the“underdog,” justasthe American publiccame tosympathizewith thewilybutoutnumbered Pan- choVilla. Itistemptingtowant tofixourmistakes, but theharder wetry,the worse weoften make them. Itissometimes more politictoleave them alone. In1971, when theNew Ybrk limes publishedthePentagon Papers,a group ofgovernment documents about thehistoryofUS. involvement in Indochina, Henry Kissinger eruptedinto avolcanic rage. Furious about the Nixon administi-ation’s vulnerabilitytothis kind ofdamaging leak, he made recommendations thateventuallyled totheformation ofagroup called thePlumbers toplugtheleaks. This was theunit that later broke into Democratic Party offices intheWatergate Hotel, setting offthechain of events that ledtoNixon’s downfall. InrealitythepublicationofthePenta- gonPaperswas not aserious threat totheadministration, butKissingefs reaction made itabigdeal. Intryingtofix oneproblem, hecreated an- other: aparanoiaforsecuritythat intheend was much more destructive to thegovernment. Had heignoredthePentagon Papers,thescandal they had created would eventuallyhave blown over. Instead ofinadvertently focusingattention on aproblem, makingit seem worse bypublicizing how much concern and anxiety itiscausing you, itisofien farwiser toplaythecontemptuous aristocrat, notdeigning toacknowledgetheproblem’s existence.

Instead shebranded theacademyaclub ofoldmem-and why should shebeangryordisappointedatnothavingtospendher time with them? Crying“sour grapes”issometimes seen asareflection ofthe weak; itisactuallythetactic ofthepowerful.
