WHAT A PRINCE NEEDS TO BE HELD IN ESTEEM N othing makes a Prince more esteemed than great deeds amplend rare displays of himself.Aragon, new there of Spain of Ferdinand of In our times,King is the ex. (1479-1516). He almost qualifies as a new Prince because he rose from the ranks of the weak to become the first King of Christen.dom in glory and fame.

Even the loser has no more interest in helping or receiving you. Who wins wants no dubious friends who won't help him in adversity. Who loses won't touch you either because you did not help him out when misfortune came. This happened in Greece when Antioch of Syria (189 B.C.) was deployed there by the Aetolians chase the Romans.
