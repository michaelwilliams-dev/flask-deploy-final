rulersmen like themselves. According toSocrates, anoble lieistheonlyway toinsure thatmenwholovethetruth will existandrule inasociety. Thenoble lie wasintended tomake bothwarriors andartisans lovethecity, toassure thattheruledwould beobedient totherulers, and, particularly, topre- vent therulers fromabusing their charge. Apparently, though, itisnot completely successful inovercoming thewarriors' temptations. Socrates goesyetfurther: they aredeprived ofallprivate property, ofeverything which theymight calltheirowntowhich theymightbecome privately at- tached, particularly money, which admits ofinfinite increase andextends thepossibility ofprivate desire. Andthey arealsodeprived ofprivacy; theyhavenoplace where theymight store illegally acquired things or enjoy forbidden pleasures. They arealways seenbymen, ifnotbygods, sothatthesecrecy needed forsuccessful lawbreaking andthegaining of anunfounded good reputation arelacking. Injustice cannot beprofit- able forthem.They arenowcompletely political, therealization ofSoc- rates' perfect artisan whocares only forwhatherulesandnotatallfor himself. They canhavenoconcern other than thecommon good. (419c-^27c) Itisnotsurprising thatAdeimantus rebels atthis point.Hehasaccepted much that isdistasteful tohimandgiven up many ofthecharms oflifeforthesakeofthefounding onwhich hehas embarked. Hewants good guardians forhiscity.Butthecomparison of the lifeoftheguardians withwhathehimself would desire istoomuch forAdeimantus. Hisoriginal demands showed him tobeafriend of justice andthepolitical community, buthewanted aneasy-going sort oflifewhich thecitywould defend. Hewascontent with thecityof sows; nothing thathascome afterward intheconstruction ofthegood cityhasgivenhimback thepersonal satisfaction heexperienced there. Hehasthecapacity forself-restraint, acertain austerity notshared by Glaucon. But this isinthename ofthatcomfortable existence which toomuch desire would destroy. Now, inmaking the lifeoftheguar- dians sohard, Socrates hastaken away Adeimantus' motive forhaving allowed them tobetrained soseverely. Adeimantus, following thepro- cedure heandGlaucon adopted intheir attacks onjustice, puts hisob- jection inthemouth ofanother. Theanonymous accuser asserts that Socrates isnotmaking theguardians happy, andAdeimantus asksSoc- rates tomake anapology tothecharge. HejoinsThrasymachus inbring- [369 ] THEREPUBLIC ingSocrates totrial.Thrasymachus charged Socrates with under- mining the city,with teaching adoctrine which would lead todis- respect forthelaw.Adeimantus' charge isnotentirely dissimilar. Asa founder, Socrates istaking away from thecitizens that forwhich they founded thecivil order, their property, theirprivacyâ€” theirown. Soc- rates subordinates happiness tosomething else, orherobsmenoftheir happiness. Histeaching isathreat tothatendforwhich everythingis done. Here, asinthe earlier accusation, theaccuser's selfishness motivates hischarge thatSocrates isunjust. Butthere isalsonodoubt thatSocrates isguilty ascharged. Socrates' defense isnot,asmight beexpected, thatthese guard- ians arehappy. Onecould have responded thatthey getaspecific pleasure fromdoing their duty, thatdevotion tothecity isnaturally good forthem. Evidently Socrates doesnotbelieve thatthi^ isthecase. Menwhoengage inpolitics forthesake ofprivate gainhave asuffi- cient motivation fortheir conduct; buttotal devotion tothecommon good doesnotyethave asufficient justification intheRepublic, andthe guardians areasked toserve without adequate compensation. Socrates' response isthatheistalking about ahappy cityandnotahappy group within it.Looking atitfrom the city's point ofview, onecanseethe advantage ofitspossessing such agroup oftotally dedicated public serv- ants.But thisonlypostpones discussing theproblem oftheindivid- ual's relation tothe city,which hasalready been postponed bythe decision toseejustice inacity first,andrenders itmore acute. Socrates treats thecityasthough itwere anorganism, asthough there could bea happy citywithout happy men. With thisresponse, Socrates hasnotmetAdeimantus' objection. Itisapowerful objection, onethatcanbemade bywisermenthan the youthful, unphilosophic Adeimantus. Aristotle himself agrees that the guardians arenothappy andthat thisspeaks against thedesirability of theregime. Even Aristotle, whom noonecould accuse ofencouraging a laxmorality, compromises withmen's wish tohavesomething oftheir own,andtherulers inhisbestregime areproperty owners. Why then does Socrates insist onmaking- such highdemands onhisrulers? Perhaps itisbecause heismore interested inrevealing aproblem than inmaking apractical suggestion. Bypushing thedemand fordedica- tion totheextreme, hebrings tolight precisely what itisinman that makes such dedication impossible andthereby indicates topractical menwhatcompromises have tobemade.Anydeviation from thisstan- dard ofdedication isindeed acompromise; forexample, thedevotion
