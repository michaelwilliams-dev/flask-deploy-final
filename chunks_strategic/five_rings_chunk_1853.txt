So,consequently, ifsomeone canshow thatwhatwehave said isfalseand ifhehasadequate knowledge that justice isbest,he undoubtedly hasgreatsympathy fortheunjust and isnotangry with them; heknows thatexcept forsomeone whofrom adivine nature can- notstand doing injustice orwhohasgained knowledge andkeepsaway from injustice, nooneelse iswillingly just;butbecause ofalack of d courage, oroldage,orsome other weakness, menblame injustice be- cause they areunable todo it.And that this issoisplain. Forthe first manofthiskind tocome topower isthe firsttodoinjustice tothebest ofhisability. And there isnoother cause ofallthisthan thatwhich gave risetothiswhole argument ofhisandmine with you, Socrates. Wesaid, 'You surprising man, ofallyouwho clairn tobepraisers of e justice— beginning with theheroes^^ atthebeginning (thosewhohave leftspeeches) uptothehuman beings ofthepresent— there isnotone whohaseverblamed injustice orpraised justice other than forthe reputations, honors, and gifts thatcome fromthem. Butastowhat each itself does with itsownpower when itisinthesoulofamanwho possesses itand isnotnoticed bygodsandmen,noonehasever, in poetry orprose, adequately developed theargument thattheone isthe greatest ofevils asoulcanhave init,andjustice thegreatest good. For ifallofyouhadspoken inthiswayfrom thebeginning andpersuaded 367a us,fromyouth onwards, wewould notkeepguard overeachother for fear injustice bedone, buteachwould behisown bestguard, afraid that indoing injustice hewould dwell with thegreatest evil.' [43 ] ADEIMANTUS/SOCRATES THEKEPUBLlC 367a "This, Socrates, andperhaps yetmore than this,would Thrasyma- chusandpossibly someone elsesayabout justice andinjustice, vulgarly turning theirpowers upside down, inmyopinion atleast.ButI—for I bneed hidenothing fromyou—outofmydesire tohear theopposite from you,speak asvehemently asIcan.Now, don't onlyshow usby theargument that justice isstronger^^ than injustice, butshowwhat each initselfdoes tothemanwhohas itthatmakes theonebadandthe other good.Andtakeaway thereputations, asGlaucon toldyou to.For ifyoudon't takethetruereputation fromeachandattach thefalseone to it,we'll saythatyou aren't praising thejustbuttheseeming, nor c blaming being unjust buttheseeming; andthatyou're exhorting oneto beunjust andtogetaway with it;andthatyouagree withThrasyma- chus thatthejust issomeone else's good, theadvantage ofthestronger, while theunjust isone'sownadvantage andprofitable, butdisadvan- tageous totheweaker. Now, sinceyouagreed thatjustice isamong the greatest goods— those thatareworth having forwhat coines fromthem butmuchmore forthemselves, such asseeing, hearing, thinking, and, d ofcourse, being healthy and alltheother goods thatarefruitful bytheir ownnature andnotbyopinion—upraise thisaspect ofjustice. Ofwhat profit isjustice initself tothemanwhopossesses it,andwhatharm does injustice do?Leave wages andreputations toothers topraise. Icould endure other men's praising justice andblaming injustice inthisway, extolling andabusing them intenns ofreputations andwages; butfrom you Icouldn't, unless youwere toordermeto,because youhave spent e yourwhole lifeconsidering nothing other than this.So,don't onlyshow usbytheargument thatjustice isstronger than injustice, butshowwhat each initselfdoes tothemanwhohas it—whether itisnoticed bygods andhuman beings ornot— thatmakes theonegood andtheother bad." Ilistened, andalthough Ihadalways been fullofwonder atthe nature ofGlaucon andAdeimantus, atthistime Iwas particularly 368a delighted and said,"That wasn't abadbeginning, youchildren ofthat man,2i thatGlaucon's lovermade tohispoem about your distinguish- ingyourselves inthebattle atMegara: Sons ofAriston,^^ divine offspring ofafiimous man. That,myfriends, inmyopinion isgood. Forsomething quite divine must certainly havehappened toyou, if-youareremaining unper- suaded that injustice isbetter than justice when youareable tospeak b thatwayonitsbehalf.Nowyoutruly don'tseem tometobebeing per- suaded. Iinfer itfrom therestofyour character, since, onthebasis of thearguments themselves, Iwould distrust you.Andthemore Itrust you,themore I'matalossastowhat Ishould do.Ontheonehand, I [44 ] Book II/367a-369b socrates/adeimantu can'thelp out.Forinmyopinion I'mnotcapable ofit;myproof isthat 368 i when Ithought Ishowed inwhat IsaidtoThrasymachus thatjustice is better than injustice, youdidn't accept itfromme.Ontheother hand, I can't nothelp out.ForI'mafraid itmight beimpious tobeherewhen justice isbeing spoken badly ofandgiveupandnotbring helpwhile I c am stillbreathing andable tomake asound. Sothebestthing istosuc- courherasIamable." Glaucon andtheothers begged meineveryway tohelpoutand nottogiveuptheargument,
