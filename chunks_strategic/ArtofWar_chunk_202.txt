mobile brigade of ascetic religious warriors to go to the rescue of small states victimized by larger ones. After his passing, Mozi�s followers continued this tradition until about the end of the Warring States era. Mencius, who lived somewhat after the time of Mozi, is famous for his elaboration of the teachings of the great educator Confucius. Whereas Mozi had focused his attention on interstate conflicts, Mencius was more concerned with class conflicts. His work strongly upholds the principle and practice of identity of interests as essential to social and political health. Accordingly, Mencius repudiated the last vestiges of ancient beliefs in the divine right of kings, and articulated the moral basis of rebellion by oppressed peoples. Both Mozi and Mencius came to be regarded by Taoists as of their number in some sense, as were Confucius and other early philosophers who wrote the I Ching and The Art of War. In the second century B.C.E., all of these schools of thought were incorporated in some way into one book, the distinguished Taoist classic known as The Masters of Huainan. The subject matter of this extraordinary book covers a wide range of inquiry including politics, sociology, ecology, biology, and psychology, weaving them into a unified science of life. The Masters of Huainan combines the teachings of the I Ching, the Tao Te Ching, and the higher teachings of The Art of War, as typified in a story on a way to practice the dictum of the last-mentioned classic of strategy, that �to win without fighting is best.� When the state of Jin marched on the state of Chu, the grandees of Chu asked the king to attack, but the king said, �Jin did not attack us during the reign of our former king; now that Jin is attacking us during my reign, it must be my fault. What can be done for this disgrace?� The grandees said, �Jin did not attack us in the time of previous ministries; now that Jin is attacking us during our administration, it must be our fault.� The king of Chu bowed his head and wept. Then he rose and bowed to his ministers. When the people of Jin heard about this, they said, �The king of Chu and his ministers are competing to take the blame on themselves; and how easily the king humbles himself to his subordinates. They cannot be attacked.� So that night the Jin army turned around to go home. This is why the Tao Te Ching says, �Who can accept the disgrace of a nation is called ruler of the land.� The Masters of Huainan relates another anecdote to illustrate a corollary principle of The Art of War, to the effect that when contention escalates to conflict there is already loss even in victory, and this can lead to even greater loss even after it has ended: The Martial Lord of Wei asked one of his ministers what had caused the destruction of a certain nation-state. The minister said, �Repeated
