tothelegislator, thear- tisansknow what thepurpose orendoftheir products is.There isno ideawhich thelegislator canlook toandimitate mechanically; hisart comprises wisdom entire. The user's art ispolitical science, ofwhich Socrates isthefounder. Tofollow outtheimage oftheRepublic, the sheep areguarded bydogswho areobedient toshepherds who arein theservice ofowners: thepeople areguarded bywarriors whoareobe- dient toguardians who areultimately obedient tophilosophers orwho [431 ] THEREPUBLIC arephilosophers themselves. Inthebest case the legislators are philosophers, butinanycasethelegislator isthemaster ofthecity. Inthisperspective itbecomes clearwhat Socrates means when he says thatthepoet isanimitator ofanimitator. Thepoet imitates the legislator. Hemust appeal toanaudience; andinthatsense heimitates thetastes andpassions ofthataudience. Butthetastes andpassions of theaudience havebeenformed bythelegislator, who isunderstood to bethecraftsman whobuilds thecityaccording tothepattern provided byhisview ofnature. Thus thepoet,wholooks totheaudience which looks tothelegislator, isatthethirdremove from nature. The poet's function leadshim tobeaservant ofconvention; hisworks give the illusion ofnature, butarefundamentally affected byconvention, and thustheydeceive man inhisquest fornature. Toputthesame thing in adifferent way, thepoetmust imitate heroes inhispoems. Butthose heroes aretheheroes ofhisnation who arealso children ofthe legislator orthefounder oftheGreek wayoflife.Because thepoet looks towhat isaround himorisconveyed bythetradition, andbe- cause hemust appeal toanaudience, heispeculiarly prone tobecome involved inthepopular prejudices. Rousseau, inhisLetter tod'Alem- bert, hasaccurately reproduced thisaspect ofSocrates' critique of poetry andgiven itamodern force.What Socrates stresses isthatthere isnothing inthepoet's artwhich impels himtothediscovery ofwhat is truly natural andmuch thatinclines himtoserve convention. Ifapoet shares theperspective ofthephilosophic legislator, ifheiscapable of themoral andintellectual virtue required forsuch aliberation, and if thatperspective caninform hispoetry, Socrates hasnoquarrel with him. From thisviewpoint, onecan alsounderstand what Socrates meant bytreating thepoet asanimitator ofartifacts. Inonesenseman isanatural being, butinanother heisaproduct ofnomos, convention. Menandmen's ways differ from place toplace astreesandtheirways donot.Thelawtransforms men tosuchanextent thatmany candoubt whether there issuch athing ashuman nature atall.Even ifthere isa natural man, or,more classically expressed, amanwho livesaccording tonature, civil society and itslawsmust aidinhiscoming tobe.Civil men, thedwellers inthecave, areinthedecisive sense theartifacts of thelegislator: their opinions aremade byhim.Human making hasa great deal todowith ourperception ofeven thethings which seem mostunambiguously natural. Men seethebeautiful sunset, thenoble river, theterrifying storm orthesacred cow.Toknow these thingswe must separate what belongs tothem naturally fromwhat opinion adds [432 ] Interpretive Essay tothem. Poetry tends toblend thenatural andconventional elements in things; and itcharms men insuch away thattheynolonger seethe seams oftheunion ofthesetwoelements. Itisnotsufficient, however, tosaythatthepoet isanimitator of animitator, forSocrates knows thatthepoet isnotsimply slavishly subservient tothelawandthelegislator. Thetragic poet depicts men's misfortunes andtheir lamentations. InBook III itwasstated thatgood mendonotsuffer atthelossofthose dear tothem, andthepoetshad beencommanded tosodepict them.Now Socrates admits thattheydo indeed lament, buttheydosoinprivate. The poet's fault lies in publicizing what isproperly private. Hiscrime consists ofbreaking the legislator's command thatmoral virtue must always berepresented as leading tohappiness. Inother words, thepoet tellsthetruth about the passions, atruth suppressed bythelaw.Men areattached totheir ovim things, andmuch ofthesignificance oflifecomes from those things, which arenotnecessarily acquired orkeptbytheexercise ofthemoral virtues. The legislator taught thatnobility andhappiness areone;the poets separate thetwoandreveal thetruth. Asamatter offact, the legislator, aswesaw inBook III,turns tothepoetwhen hewishes to learn thenature ofthehuman passions. Inorder toknow what inman hastobeovercome inorder toestablish agood regime, Socrates studies Homer. Homer, then, isnotSocrates' opponent because heknows nothing ofnature. Itisrather because heknows only thatpartofnature which causes men tolaugh orcry,thepart thatmakes human lifeappear either ridiculous ormiserable. Thepoets dealwith thefailures ofacting menandshowwhat theRepublic hasalsoshownâ€” thatthepractical or moral life isessentially
