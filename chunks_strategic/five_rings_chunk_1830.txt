asitappears inComford without beingdrawn up short, without being puzzled. Butthis isonlybecause itsaysnothing. It usescommonplace terms which havenoprecise significance; itisthe kind ofsentence onefinds innewspaper editorials. From having been shocking orincomprehensible, Platobecomes boring. There isnofood forreflection here. Virtue hasbecome character. Butvirtue hasbeen a theme from thebeginning oftheRepublic, and ithasreceived amost subtle treatment. Asamatter offact^the whole issue ofthebook is whether oneofthevirtues, justice, ischoiceworthy initself oronly for itsaccessory advantages/ Socrates inthispassage teaches thataman oftheSpartan type— thekind ofmanmost reputed forvirtue—really does notlove virtue foritsown sake,butforother advantages follow- ingupon it.Secretly hebelieves money istruly good. This isthesame critique Aristotle makes ofSparta. Thequestion raised here iswhether allvulgar virtue, allnonphilosophic practice ofthevirtues, isbased upon expectation ofsome kind offurther reward ornot.None ofthis would appear from Comford's version, nomatter howhard thestu- dentofthetextmight think about it.Heeven suppresses Adeimantus' question sothattheentire atmosphere ofperplexity disappears. Now, Adeirnantus isanadmirer ofSparta, andSocrates hasbeen trying to [XV ] Preface correct and purify that, admiration. Adeimantus' question indicates hisdifficulty inunderstanding Socrates' criticism ofwhatheadmires; itshowshow littlehehaslearned. Thedramatic aspect ofthedialogue isnotwithout significance. Comford isundoubtedly right thatvirtue nolonger means what it used tomean andthat ithaslost itscurrency. (However, ifonewere to assert that courage, forexample, isavirtue, most contemporaries would havesome divination ofwhatone istalking about.) But isthis senility oftheword onlyanaccident? Ithasbeen saidthat itisoneof thegreat mysteries ofWestern thought "how aword which used to mean themanliness ofmanhascome tomean thechastity ofwoman." Thischange insignificance istheproduct ofanewunderstanding ofthe nature ofmanwhich began with Machiavelli. (Iftherewere atransla- tion ofthePrince which always translated virtu byvirtue, the student whocompared itwith theRepublic would beinaposition tomake themost exciting ofdiscoveries.) "Freedom" took theplace of"virtue" asthemost important term ofpolitical discourse, and virtue came tomean social virtue—that is,thedisposition which would leadmen tobeobedient tocivil authority and live inpeace together rather than thenatural perfection ofthe soul.Theman whobegins hisstudies should notbeexpected toknow these things, buttheonly tolerable result oflearning isthathebecome aware of them andbeable toreflect onwhich ofthealternatives most ade- quately describes thehuman condition. As itnow stands, hemaywell berobbed ofthegreatest opportunity forenlightenment afforded bytheclassic literature. Astudy oftheuseoftheword "virtue" in theRepublic isbyitselfmost revealing; andwhen, inaddition, its sense iscompared inCicero, Thomas Aquinas, Hobbes, andRous- seau, thetrue history ofpolitical thought comes tolight, andaseries ofalternatives ispresented tothemind. These authors allself-con- sciously used thesame term and intheir disagreement were re- ferring tothesame issues. Thereader must besensitized bythe useoftheterm toawhole ethos inwhich "virtue" was stillapolitical issue. Comford uses safeguard instead ofguardian. This isunob- jectionable initself, butguardian isaword thathasbeen laden with significance bywhat haspreceded inthe^book. The rulers, inparticular thosewho fightandthushold thepower inthe city, havebeen called guardians since their introduction inBook II.Ina sense theproblem oftheRepublic wastoeducate aruling classwhich issuch astopossess thecharacteristics ofboth thecitizen, who cares forhiscountry andhasthespirit tofight for it,andthephilosopher, who isgentle andcosmopolitan. This isaquasi-impossibility, and itis [xvi] Preface theleading theme oftheonerous andcomplex training prescribed in thesucceeding fivebooks. Iftheeducation does notsucceed, justice mustbefundamentally compromised withthenature ofthosewhohold power. Inthecontext under discussion here Socrates isdiscussing the regimes which have tobefounded onthefundamental compromise be- cause oftheflawed character oftheguardians' virtues. Regimes depend onmen's virtues, notoninstitutions; ifthehighest virtues arenotpres- entintherulers, aninferior regime mustbeinstituted. There areno guardians above theguardians; )theonlyguardian oftheguardians isa proper education/ Itisthistheme towhich thereader's attention must bebrought. J(Andi^ocrates tellsussomething important about thateducation; it consists
