Cardimzf ftichelieru, 1585-1642 KEYS TOPOWER Accordingtothecosmology oftheancient Greeks, thegodswere thought tohave completevision into thefuture. Theysaweverythingtocome, rightdown totheintricate details. Men, ontheother hand, were seen as victims offate, trapped inthemoment and their emotions, unable tosee beyond immediate dangers. Those heroes, such asOdysseus,who were able tolook beyondthepresentandplanseveralsteps ahead, seemed to defyfate, toapproximatethegods intheir abilitytodetermine thefuture.

They maybelieve theyarethinkingallthe waytotheend, buttheyarereally only focusingonthehappy ending,and deludingthemselves bythestrength oftheir desire. In415 B.C., theancient Athenians attacked Sicily, believingtheir ex- peditionwould bring them riches, power, and aglorious endingtothesix- teen-year PeloponnesianWar. They did notconsider thedangersofan invasion sofarfrom home; they did notforesee that theSicilians would light alltheharder since thebattles were intheir own homeland, orthat allofAthens’s enemies would band together against them, orthat war would break out onseveral fronts, stretching their forces way toothin. TheSicilian expeditionwas acomplete disaster, leadingtothedestruction LAW 2!) .24! ofone ofthegreatestcivilizations ofalltime. The Athenians were ledinto this disaster bytheir hearts, nottheir minds.
