Observance II Soon after Baron JamesRothschild made hisfortune inParis intheearly 1820s, hefaced hismost intractable problem: How could ajew and 3.Ger man, atotal outsider toFrenchsociety,win therespectofthexenophobic Frenchupperclasses? Rothschild was aman who understood power--—he knew that hisfortune would bringhim status, but that ifheremained so ciallyalienated neither hisstatus nor hisfortune would last. Sohelooked at thesocietyofthetime and asked what would wintheir hearts. Charity?The French couldn’t care less. Political influence? Healready hadthat, andifanythingitonlymade peoplemore suspicious ofhim. The oneweak spot, hedecided, was boredom. Intheperiod oftherestoration ofthemonarchy,the Frenchupperclasses were bored. SoRothschild begantospend astoundingsums ofmoneyonentertaining them. Hehired thebest architects inFrance todesign hisgardensandballroom; hehired Marie-Antoine Caréme, the most celebrated French chef, topreparethe most lavish partiesParis had ever witnessed; noFrenchman could resist, even ifthepartieswere given byaGerman Jew.
