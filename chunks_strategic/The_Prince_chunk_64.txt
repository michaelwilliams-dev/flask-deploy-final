the State on what is � not on what should be. Machiavelli served Florence as a ministerial secretary and in other roles, being briefly imprisoned and tortured in 1513. He executed vari.ous diplomatic missions to the Papacy, France, and to other states in It.aly. He married in 1501 to Marietta di Luigi Corsini and had six chil.dren, although he was not a great family man. He also had a long liai.son with the singer, Barbara Salutati. His general allegiance, surpris.ingly, was to Republicanism, although he largely favored constitutional monarchy with parliamentary power and a king. Machiavelli ended up being distrusted and suspect to a wide spec.trum of political and religious forces and was excluded from office when in the year of his death, 1527, he returned to Florence under the new republican constitution.

The hope here is that the reader will come closer to Machiavelli's original spin even when slightly arcane or outmoded. The purpose in reading such a text as the The Prince is after all to reenter the past in a living way just as much as it is to update the past or claim it in the pre.

It needs the authentic ring of its own context and surroundings , its own oxygen , to be true to itself. If that makes it sound quaint , so be it . After all , history is about antiquated times � times when things were different , not just the same as now. Let us import some of this value and spirit into our minds rather than merely be revisionists of the past. The past is past. That is its value . That is why we opt for a rather simple rendering, leaning in the direction of transliteration , rather than sophisticating Machiavelli's text to our taste . Although bias will always creep in, this should
