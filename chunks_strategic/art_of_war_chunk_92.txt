six new grounds, with six variations of plan to match. None of these is mentioned again, though the first is hardly to be distinguished from ground no. 4 in the next chapter. At last, in chap. XI, we come to the Nine Grounds par excellence, immediately followed by the variations. This takes us down to ss. 14. In SS. 43-45, fresh definitions are provided for nos. 5, 6, 2, 8 and 9 (in the order given), as well as for the tenth ground noticed in chap. VIII; and finally, the nine variations are enumerated once more from beginning to end, all, with the exception of 5, 6 and 7, being different from those previously given. Though it is impossible to account for the present state of Sun Tzu�s text, a few suggestive facts maybe brought into prominence: (1) Chap. VIII, according to the title, should deal with nine variations, whereas only five appear. (2) It is an abnormally short chapter. (3) Chap. XI is entitled The Nine Grounds. Several of these are defined twice over, besides which there are two distinct lists of the corresponding variations. (4) The length of the chapter is disproportionate, being double CHAPTER 12. THE NINE SITUATIONS 108 that of any other except IX. I do not propose to draw any inferences from these facts, beyond the general conclusion that Sun Tzu�s work cannot have come down to us in the shape in which it left his hands: chap.

For it is the soldier�s disposition to offer an obstinate resistance when sur- rounded, to fight hard when he cannot help himself, and to obey promptly when he has fallen into danger. [Chang Yu alludes to the conduct of Pan Ch�ao�s devoted followers in 73 A.D. The story runs thus in the HOU HAN SHU, ch. 47: "When Pan Ch�ao arrived at Shan-shan, Kuang, the King of the country, received him at first with great politeness and respect; but shortly afterwards his be- havior underwent a sudden change, and he became remiss and negligent. Pan Ch�ao spoke about this to the officers of his suite: �Have you no- ticed,� he said, �that Kuang�s polite intentions are on the wane? This must signify that envoys have come from the Northern barbarians, and that con- sequently he is in a state of indecision, not knowing with which side to throw in his lot. That surely is the reason. The truly wise man, we are told, can perceive things before they have come to pass; how much more, then, those that are already manifest!� Thereupon he called one of the nat- ives who had been assigned to his service, and set a trap for him, saying: �Where are those envoys from the Hsiung-nu who arrived some day ago?� The man was so taken aback that between surprise and fear
