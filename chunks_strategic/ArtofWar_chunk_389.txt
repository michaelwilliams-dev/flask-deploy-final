and they pass through a phase where the shinai seems very heavy to them. Practitioners of kendo are very sensitive to the balance and differences in weight of their shinai, a difference of 10 or 20 grams being strongly felt. When kendo is practiced using two shinai (nito), the large shinai weighs about 375 grams and the small one 265. But when doing combat exercises, a shinai of 375 grams, held with just one hand, seems very heavy, and very few modern kendo practitioners succeed in handling one one-handed with ease. The large sword that Musashi talks about weighed between 1,200 and 1,500 grams. Thus it was three to four times heavier than the shinai currently used in the nito (two shinai) combat form. 1. Here I decided to translate hoi this way because it seemed to me to have the sense of �initial intention.� 2. This sentence explains what the way of strategy means for Musashi. It goes far beyond handling a sword. He makes things that others might seek in religion a part of strategy itself. One anecdote�perhaps romanticized�tells us that on his way to meet a great number of opponents whom he was supposed to face in a fight in which his chances were very poor, Musashi passed by a Shinto shrine. Suddenly becoming aware that he had started to pray with the intention of asking for the protection of the gods, he straightened up and came to his senses, accusing himself of lacking confidence in his strategy, for he should be trusting his fate only to that. (61) This is the sense in which the phrase of Musashi�s found in the Dokkodo is usually interpreted: �Respect the Buddha and the gods without relying on their help.� In this way he expresses incisively and explicitly a tendency that ordinarily underlies the philosophy of budo but is left unspoken. Warriors could be practitioners of different religions, but the religions were more a coloration of the way of the warrior than the other way around. 1. Hyoho futatsu no ji no ri: Literally, ri means �interest, advantage.� Musashi often uses ri without distinguishing it from its other meaning, �reason, principle, the logic of things, meaning.� Here, in connection with �knowing the ri of the two ideograms hyo and ho,� it seems more plausible that ri has more the sense of �meaning� or �principle� than �interest� or �advantage.� 2. Musashi uses the term bugei to designate the martial arts in general. It is important to note that Musashi makes a point of the demarcation separating hyoho from the other terms. That is why I prefer here to indicate the Japanese term he uses each time rather than to translate them all as �martial arts.� We have: hyoho sha: man of hyoho, someone who knows how to handle the sword ite: archer teppo uchi: someone who shoots a gun yari tsukai: expert with a lance naginata tsukai: expert with the naginata tachi tsukai: expert with the long sword wakizashi tsukai: expert
