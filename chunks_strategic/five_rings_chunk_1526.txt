carcass ofwhat waspurported tobea mermaid. This creature resembled amonkeywith thebody ofafish, but the head andbodywere perfectly joined—itwastrulyawonder. After some research Barnum discovered that the creature had been expertly put together injapan,where thehoax had caused quiteastir. Henevertheless plantedarticles innewspapersaround thecountry claimingthecapture ofamermaid intheFijiIslands. Healso sent thepa— perswoodcut prints ofpaintings showingmermaids. Bythetime heshowed thespecimeninhismuseum, anational debate had beensparkedover the existence ofthese mythicalcreatures. Afewmonths before Batnum’s cam~ paign,no one had cared oreven known about mermaids; noweveryone wastalkingabout them asiftheywere real. Crowds flocked inrecord num» bers toseetheFijiMermaid, and tohear debates onthesubject. Afewyears later, Barnum toured Europe with General Tom Thumb. a five-year—olddwarf from Connecticut whom Bamum claimed was an elevenvyear-old English boy, and whom hehad trained todomanyre- markable acts. During this tour Bamum’s name attracted such attention thatQueen Victoria, thatparagonofsobriety, requestedaprivateaudience with him and histalented dwarf atBuckingham Palace. TheEnglish press mayhave ridiculed Bamum, butVictoria wasroyally entertained byhim, andrespected him ever after. Interpretation Barnum understood the fundamental truth aboutattractingattention: Once people’s eyesare onyou, youhave aspecial legitimacy.ForBarnum, creatinginterest meant creatingacrowd; ashelater wrote, “Every crowd has asilver lining.” And crowds tend toactinconjunction. Ifone person stopstoseeyour beggarman laying bricks inthestreet, more will dothe same. They willgather like dust bunnies. Then, givenagentle push, they will enter yourmuseum orwatch yourshow. Tocreate acrowd you have to dosomething different and odd. Anykind ofcuriosity will serve thepur- pose,forcrowds aremagnetically attracted bytheunusual andinexplica- ble.And once you have their attention, never letitgo.Ifitveers toward other people,itdoes soatyour expense. Barnum would ruthlesslysuck at~ tention from hiscompetitors, knowingwhat avaluable commodity itis. Atthebeginning ofyourrisetothetop,then, spendallyour energyon attractingattention. Most important:The qualityoftheattention isirrele vant. Nomatter how badly hisshows were reviewed, orhow slanderously personalwere theattacks onhishoaxes, Barnum would never complain. If anewspaper critic reviled himparticularly badly, infact, hemade sure to invite the man toanopening and togivehim thebest seat inthehouse. He would even writeanonymousattacks onhis own work, justtokeep his name inthepapers. From Bamum’s vantage, attentionwwhether negative orpositive——was themain ingredient ofhis success.
