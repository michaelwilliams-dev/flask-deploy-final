division, and only half your force will reach the goal. [Literally, "the leader of the first division will be TORN AWAY."] 10. If you march thirty LI with the same object, two-thirds of your army will arrive. [In the T�UNG TIEN is added: "From this we may know the difficulty of maneuvering."] 11. We may take it then that an army without its baggage- train is lost; without provisions it is lost; without bases of supply it is lost. [I think Sun Tzu meant "stores accumulated in depots." But Tu Yu says "fodder and the like," Chang Yu says "Goods in general," and Wang Hsi says "fuel, salt, foodstuffs, etc."] 1See Col. Henderson, op. cit. vol. I. p. 426. CHAPTER 8. MANEUVERING 63 12. We cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the designs of our neighbors. 13. We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country�its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps. 14. We shall be unable to turn natural advantage to account unless we make use of local guides. [ss. 12-14 are repeated in chap. XI. ss. 52.] 15. In war, practice dissimulation, and you will succeed. [In the tactics of Turenne, deception of the enemy, especially as to the numerical strength of his troops, took a very prominent position. 2 ] 16. Whether to concentrate or to divide your troops, must be decided by cir- cumstances. 17. Let your rapidity be that of the wind, [The simile is doubly appropriate, because the wind is not only swift but, as Mei Yao-ch�en points out, "invisible and leaves no tracks."] your compactness that of the forest. [Meng Shih comes nearer to the mark in his note: "When slowly marching, order and ranks must be preserved"�so as to guard against surprise attacks. But natural forest do not grow in rows, whereas they do generally possess the quality of density or compactness.] 18. In raiding and plundering be like fire, [Cf. SHIH CHING, IV. 3. iv. 6: "Fierce as a blazing fire which no man can check."] is immovability like a mountain. [That is, when holding a position from which the enemy is trying to dis- lodge you, or perhaps, as Tu Yu says, when he is trying to entice you into a trap.] 19. Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt. [Tu Yu quotes a saying of T�ai Kung which has passed into a proverb: "You cannot shut your ears to the thunder or your eyes to the lighting� so rapid are they." Likewise, an attack should be made so quickly that it cannot be parried.] 2For a number of maxims on this head, see "Marshal Turenne" (Longmans, 1907), p. 29. CHAPTER 8. MANEUVERING 64 20. When you plunder a countryside, let the spoil be divided amongst your men; [Sun Tzu wishes to lessen the abuses of indiscriminate plundering by in-
