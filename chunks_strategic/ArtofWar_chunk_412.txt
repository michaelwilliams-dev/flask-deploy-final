added to their number by Chi T�ien-pao, being wrongly placed after his grandson Tu Mu. 4. TU MU (803-852) is perhaps the best known as a poet � a bright star even in the glorious galaxy of the T�ang period. We learn from Ch�ao Kung-wu that although he had no practical experience of war, he was extremely fond of dis- cussing the subject, and was moreover well read in the military history of the 39Cf. Catalogue of the library of Fan family at Ningpo: "His commentary is frequently obscure; it fur- nishes a clue, but does not fully develop the meaning." 40WEN HSIEN T�UNG K�AO, ch. 221. 41It is interesting to note that M. Pelliot has recently discovered chapters 1, 4 and 5 of this lost work in the "Grottos of the Thousand Buddhas." See B.E.F.E.O., t. VIII, nos. 3-4, p. 525. CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 19 CH�UN CH�IU and CHAN KUO eras. His notes, therefore, are well worth at- tention. They are very copious, and replete with historical parallels. The gist of Sun Tzu�s work is thus summarized by him: "Practice benevolence and justice, but on the other hand make full use of artifice and measures of expediency." He further declared that all the military triumphs and disasters of the thousand years which had elapsed since Sun Tzu�s death would, upon examination, be found to uphold and corroborate, in every particular, the maxims contained in his book. Tu Mu�s somewhat spiteful charge against Ts�ao Kung has already been con- sidered elsewhere. 1. CH�EN HAO appears to have been a contemporary of Tu Mu. Ch�ao Kung- wu says that he was impelled to write a new commentary on Sun Tzu because Ts�ao Kung�s on the one hand was too obscure and subtle, and that of Tu Mu on the other too long-winded and diffuse. Ou-yang Hsiu, writing in the middle of the 11th century, calls Ts�ao Kung, Tu Mu and Ch�en Hao the three chief commentators on Sun Tzu, and observes that Ch�en Hao is continually attacking Tu Mu�s shortcomings. His commentary, though not lacking in merit, must rank below those of his predecessors. 2. CHIA LIN is known to have lived under the T�ang dynasty, for his commentary on Sun Tzu is mentioned in the T�ang Shu and was afterwards republished by Chi Hsieh of the same dynasty together with those of Meng Shih and Tu Yu. It is of somewhat scanty texture, and in point of quality, too, perhaps the least valuable of the eleven. 3. MEI YAO-CH�EN (1002-1060), commonly known by his "style" as Mei Sheng- yu, was, like Tu Mu, a poet of distinction. His commentary was published with a laudatory preface by the great Ou-yang Hsiu, from which we may cull the fol- lowing: Later scholars have misread Sun Tzu, distorting his words and trying to make them square with their own one-sided views. Thus, though commentators have not been lacking, only a few have proved equal to the task. My friend Sheng-yu has not fallen
