He started toappear inpublic with her onhisarm, and then hebought and furnished anapartmentforher onone ofMunich’s most fashionable boulevards. Al» thoughhehad been known asamiser, and was notgiven toflights of fancy, hestarted toshower Lola with and towritepoetryforher. Now hisfavored mistress, shecatapultedtofame andfortune overnight. Lolabegantolose her sense ofproportion.Onedaywhen she was out riding,anelderlyman rode ahead ofher, abittooslowlyforherliking.

Thedogat» tacked apasserby,butinstead ofhelpingthe mengetthedog away,she whippedhim with theleash. Incidents likethisinfuriated thestolid citizens ofBavaria, butLudwig stood byLola and even had hernaturalized asa Bavarian citizen. Thekings entouragetried towake him tothedangers of theaffair, butthose who criticized Lola were summarilyfired. While Bavarians who had loved their kingnow outwardlydisre— spected him, Lola was made acountess, had anewpalace built forherself, andbegantodabble inpolitics, advising Ludwigonpolicy.She was the most powerfulforce inthekingdom. Her influence intheking’s cabinet continued togrow,and shetreated theother ministers with disdain. As a result, riots broke outthroughout therealm. Aonce peaceful land was vir~ rually inthegrip ofcivil war, and students everywherewere chanting, “Raus mitLola!” ByFebruary of1848, Ludwigwasfinally unable towithstand thepres- sure. With great sadness heordered Lola. toleave Bavaria immediately. Sheleft,but notuntil she waspaidoff.Forthenext five weeks theBevan‘- ans’ wrath wasturned against their formerlybeloved king.

Shedied twoyears later, in 1861. Interpretation Lola Montez attracted men with herwiles, butherpowerover them went beyond thesexual. Itwasthrough theforce ofhercharacter that shekept herlovers enthralled. Men were sucked into themaelstrom shechurned up around her.Theyfeltconfused, upset,butthestrength oftheemotions she stirred also made them feel more alive. Asisoften the case with infection, theproblems would onlyarise over time. Lola’s inherent instabilitywould begintogetunder herlovers’ skin. They would find themselves drawn into herproblems,buttheir emotional attachment toherwould make them want tohelpher. This was thecrucial point oftheclisease--for Lola Montez could notbehelped.Herproblems were toodeep.Once thelover identified with them, hewas lost.
