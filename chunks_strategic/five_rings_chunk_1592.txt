LLONARDQ DAVINCI. 14324519 164 LAW 22TRANSGRESSION OFTHE LAW The island ofMelos isstrategicallysituated intheheart oftheMediter- ranean. Inclassical times, thecityofAthens dominated the seaand coastal areas around Greece, butSparta,inthePeloponnese,had been Mel0s’s original colonizer. During thePeloponnesian War, then, theMelians re- fused toallythemselves with Athens and remained loyaltoMotherSparta. In416 B.C. theAthenians sent anexpedition againstMelos, Before launch- inganall—out attack, however, they dispatchedadelegationtopersuadethe Melians tosurrender and become anallyrather than suffer devastation and defeat. “You know aswell aswedo,” thedelegates said, “that thestandard of justice dependsontheequalityofpowertocompel,and that infact the strongdowhat theyhave thepowertodoand theweak acceptwhat they have toaccept.”When theMelians respondedthat this denied thenotion offairplay,theAthenians said that those inpowerdetermined what was fair and what was not. The Melians arguedthat thisauthority belongedto thegods,not tomortals, “Our opinion ofthegodsand ourknowledgeof men,” repliedamember oftheAthenian delegation,“lead ustoconclude that itisageneralandnecessarylawofnature torule whatever one can.” The Melians would notbudge. Sparta, they insisted, would come to their defense. The Athenians countered that theSpartanswere aconserva- tive,practical people, andwould nothelpMelos because they hadnothing togain and alottolosebydoingso. FinallytheMelians begantotalkofhonor and theprinciple ofresisting brute force. “Do notbeledastray byafalse sense ofhonor,” said theAthe- nians. “Honor often brings men toruin when theyarefaced with anobvi- ousdangerthat somehow affects their pride. There isnothing disgracefulin giving waytothegreatest cityinHellas when she isoffering yousuch rea- sonable terms.” The debate ended. The Melians discussed theissue among themselves, and decided totrust intheaidoftheSpartans,thewill ofthe gods,and thetightnessoftheir cause. They politely declined theAthenians’ offer. Afewdayslater theAthenians invaded Melos. The Melians fought nobly,even without theSpartans,who didnot come totheir rescue. Ittook several attemptsbefore theAthenians could surround and besiegetheir main city,but theMelians finallysurrendered. The Athenians wasted no tirne—they puttodeath allthe men ofmilitary agethattheycouldcapture, theysold the women and children asslaves, andthey re.-populated theis land with their own colonists. Onlyahandful ofMelians survived. Interpretation The Athenians were one ofthe most eminently practical peopleinhistory, andtheymade the most practical argument they could with theMelians: Whenyouareweaker, there isnothingtobegained byfightingauseless fight. No one comes tohelp theweak—by doingsotheywould only put themselves injeopardy.The weak are alone and must submit. Fighting gives younothingtogain butmartyrdom,and intheprocessalotofpeople who donotbelieve inyourcause will die. Weakness isnosin,and can even become astrength ifyou learn how toplayitright.Had theMelians surrendered inthefirstplace, theywould have been able tosabotagetheAthenians insubtle ways,ormighthave gotten what theycould have outofthealliance and then leftitwhen the Athenians themselves were weakened, asinfacthappened several years later.
