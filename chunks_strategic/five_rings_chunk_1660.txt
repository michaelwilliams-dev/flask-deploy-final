Loller ofcourse did most ofthetalking, and onenight heconfessed that hisbusiness wasdoing poorly,with more troubles ahead. Inreturn, Lustig confided inhis new friend that he too had seriousmoney prob1ems——Communisls had seized hisfamilyestate and allitsassets. He was tooold tolearn atrade and gotowork.
