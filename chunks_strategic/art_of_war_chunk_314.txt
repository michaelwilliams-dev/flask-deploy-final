that what is appropriate depends on the situation and cannot be determined in a dogmatic or peremptory fashion. Thus with the successive arising of new situations and new realities, reexamination of aims and measures is necessary to ensure the maintenance of effective alignments of efforts with actualities. �Private and public wealth are one. There are those who have too little life and too much money, and there are those who have too little money and too much life: only enlightened rulers and sages recognize them, and thus can keep them in place. When those who die are not bitter, those who are bereft are not resentful.� Private and public wealth are one from the point of view of the totality of the economy; the manner in which wealth circulates back and forth between the private and public sectors defines the economy in certain ways, of which enlightened leadership must be aware in order to understand the real and potential effects of programs and policies. To have too little life and too much money means to have more wealth than can be effectively used under these conditions; to have too little money and too much life means to have more energy or talent than can be constructively employed under these conditions. The wealth of a society that can balance these two extremes does not leak away. When people die without bitterness and leave no resentment behind them, that means they did the best they could under the conditions in which they lived. �When there is an abundance of money and goods, things are easy. When things are easy, the people do not attribute the merit to their rulers. . . . Therefore to accumulate wealth for the people is the means whereby you may accumulate wealth yourself; this is how warriors last � This key idea of Sun Bin is based on traditional philosophy. In his commentary on the classic I Ching, or Book of Changes, the educator Confucius wrote, �Those above secure their homes by kindness to those below.� Also, �Leaders distribute blessings to reach those below them, while avoiding presumption of virtue.� According to the later Taoist Masters of Huainan, who compiled a great deal of ancient philosophical and scientific lore, �When people have more than enough, they defer; when they have less than enough, they contend. When people defer, courtesy and justice are born; when they contend, violence and disorder arise.� [ 12 ] Killing Soldiers Master Sun said, �. . . When you know soldiers are trustworthy, don�t let others alienate them. Fight only when you are sure to win, without letting anyone know. In battle, don�t forget your flanks, don�t . . .� Most of this chapter is missing or corrupt. Even when people are known to be trustworthy, their loyalty should not be taken for granted. Interlopers may attempt to alienate them, and complacency or arrogance on the part of leadership makes it easier for divisiveness and recalcitrance to take root in the lower echelons.
