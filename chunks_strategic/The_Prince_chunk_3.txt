the enemy: Would we admire him? What if he put out lies for personal gains, or to hide personal misbehavior: Would we consider him virtuous � after all, he still accomplished the mission? Machiavelli denies attributes of virtue to those who, in capacity of leadership, use the not means for themselves personally and for those whom they represent or govern. Machiavelli�s concern is that leaders, at all levels, need to fulfill the role of governing for the benefit of the people, and to defend them at all costs. Virtue does not necessarily stand alone as the most important attribute of those in private or public life. The second most im.portant attribute is astuteness, which means strength, street smart. Its counter part would be weakness or appeasement � attributes that generate danger and self-destruction. Leaders have to be vir.tuous and astute, diligent in their comportment as the caretakers of their people, and be aware of what other leaders and nations do. Machiavelli would build dams before not after floods. If a river brings water from another nation, Machiavelli�s Prince would want to know who and how the leaders and their people control the flow of water. The astute Prince would con.tinuously be concerned with that water flow and be ready to take control of it if his nation�s survival is threatened. Notwithstanding positive or negative results from actions taken, even if the action is to insure proper resources for his na.tion, the Prince�s means to achieve his end would come under the same scrutiny as with the general. His virtue transcends the details of the means when leaders are in the throws of making important decisions. The questions, however, are the same for everyone. If President, what is best for his people? If CEO, what is best for his company? If a tyrant, what is best for himself? If priest, what is best for his flock? Concerning the latter, priests swear to dedicate their lives in upholding and protecting the flock. When they turn their flock into prey, they become vicious and treacherous, unlike wolves, 10� Niccol� Machiavelli which nurture their young and protect them against other preda.tors. And, when their criminally predatory acts go un-answered by church administrators and go unpunished by civil authorities, they continue to harm their victims and turn the community into one continuous Calvary. Regarding these men of the cloth, Ma.chiavelli would be harsher than Dante � remember the number of priests populating Hell? In seeing the church infiltrated, Machiavelli would have been the first condemn the Pope, his cardinals and the public offi. to cials who allowed it to happen. In the end, Popes need to be holy, but just as astute as the next successful politician. Is it preferable to be loved rather than hated, to lie rather than tell the truth, or to be honest or to be dishonest? For different rea.sons, Machiavelli would ascribe any if not all of these attributes to men and women engaged in conducting public office. Neces.sity often
