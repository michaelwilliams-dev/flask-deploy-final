In getting thebetter, heiswealthy anddoesgood tofriends andharm to c [39 ] glaucon/adeimantus/socrates therepublic 362c enemies.

So,inall hkehhood, itisalsomore appropriate forhim tobedearer tothegods than isthejustman. Thus, they say,Socrates, withgodsandwith hu- mans, abetter life isprovided fortheunjust manthan forthejust man." d When Glaucon hadsaid this, Ihad itinmind tosaysomething to it,but hisbrother Adeimantus said inhisturn, "You surely don't believe, Socrates, thattheargument hasbeen adequately stated?" "Why not?" Isaid. "What mostneeded tobesaidhasnotbeen said," hesaid. "Then," Isaid, "asthesaying goes, 'letaman stand byhis brother."' So,you too, ifheleaves outanything, come tohisdefense. And yet,whathesaidwasalready enough tobringmetomyknees and make itimpossible tohelp outjustice." e Andhesaid,"Nonsense. But stillhear thistoo.Wemust alsogo through thearguments opposed tothose ofwhich hespoke, those that praise justice andblame injustice, sothatwhatGlaucon inmyopinion wants willbeclearer. Nodoubt, fathers saytotheir sonsandexhort 363a them, asdoallthosewhohave careofanyone, thatonemustbejust. However, they don't praise justice byitself butthegood reputations thatcome from it;they exhort their charges tobejust sothat, asa result oftheopinion, ruling offices andmarriages willcome totheone whoseems tobejust,and alltheother things thatGlaucon amoment agoattributed tothejustman asaresult ofhishaving agood reputa- tion.And thesemen tellevenmore ofthethings resulting from the opinions. Forbythrowing ingood reputation with thegods, theycan tellofaninexhaustible store ofgoods thatthey saygods give tothe holy.And inthiswaythey joinboth thenoble Hesiod andHomer. Theformer says that forthejustthegodsmake theoaks b Bear acorns onhigh, andbees inthemiddle. And thefleecy sheep heavily laden withwool^ andmany other verygood things connected with these.Andtheother haspretty much thesame totell,aswhen hesays. Asforsome blameless kingwho infearofthegods c Upholds justice, theblack earth bears Barley andwheat, thetrees areladen with fruit. Thesheep bring forth without fail,andthe seaprovides fish.^ AndMusaeus andhissongive thejusteven headier goods than these from thegods. Intheirspeech theyleadthem intoHades andlaythem [40 ] Book 11/362c-364e adeimantus down oncouches; crowning them, theyprepare asymposium ofthe 363c holy,andtheythenmakethemgothrough therestoftimedrunk, inthe behef thatthefinestwage ofvirtue isaneternal drunk.^" Others ex- d tendthewages from thegods yetfurther than these. Fortheysaythata holyandoath-keeping man leaves hischildren's children andawhole tribebehind him.Sointheseand likeways they extol justice. And, in turn, theybury theunholy andunjust inmud inHades andcompel them tocarry water inasieve; andtheybringthem intobadreputation while they are still alive. Thus, those penalties thatGlaucon described e asthelotofthejustmenwho arereputed tobeunjust, these people sayarethelotoftheunjust. Buttheyhave nothing else tosay.This then isthepraise andblame attached toeach. "Furthermore, Socrates, consider stillanother form ofspeeches about justice and injustice, spoken inprose^^ andbypoets. With one tongue they allchant thatmoderation andjustice arefair,buthardand 364a fullofdrudgery, while intemperance andinjustice aresweet andeasy to acquire, andshameful onlybyopinion andlaw.They saythattheun- just isforthemost partmore profitable than thejust;andboth in public and inprivate, they areready andwilling tocallhappy andto honor badmenwhohavewealth orsome otherpower andtodishonor andoverlook thosewhohappen insomeway tobeweak orpoor, al- though theyagree they arebetter than theothers.
