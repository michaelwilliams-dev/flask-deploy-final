strictly adheres to method and discipline; thus it is in his power to control success. 2. In respect of military method, we have, firstly, Measurement; secondly, Es- timation of quantity; thirdly, Calculation; fourthly, Balancing of chances; fifthly, Victory. 3. Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to Meas- urement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity; Balancing of chances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances. [It is not easy to distinguish the four terms very clearly in the Chinese. The first seems to be surveying and measurement of the ground, which enable us to form an estimate of the enemy�s strength, and to make calculations based on the data thus obtained; we are thus led to a general weighing-up, or comparison of the enemy�s chances with our own; if the latter turn the scale, then victory ensues. The chief difficulty lies in third term, which in the Chinese some commentators take as a calculation of NUMBERS, thereby making it nearly synonymous with the second term. Perhaps the second term should be thought of as a consideration of the enemy�s general position or condition, while the third term is the estimate of his numerical strength. On the other hand, Tu Mu says: "The question of relative strength having been settled, we can bring the varied resources of cunning into play." Ho Shih seconds this interpretation, but weakens it. However, it points to the third term as being a calculation of numbers.] 1. A victorious army opposed to a routed one, is as a pound�s weight placed in the scale against a single grain. [Literally, "a victorious army is like an I (20 oz.) weighed against a SHU (1/24 oz.); a routed army is a SHU weighed against an I." The point is simply the enormous advantage which a disciplined force, flushed with victory, has over one demoralized by defeat." Legge, in his note on Men- cius, I. 2. ix. 2, makes the I to be 24 Chinese ounces, and corrects Chu Hsi�s statement that it equaled 20 oz. only. But Li Ch�uan of the T�ang dynasty here gives the same figure as Chu Hsi.] 1. The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up waters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep. Chapter 6 ENERGY 1. Sun Tzu said: The control of a large force is the same principle as the control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their numbers. [That is, cutting up the army into regiments, companies, etc., with sub- ordinate officers in command of each. Tu Mu reminds us of Han Hsin�s famous reply to the first Han Emperor, who once said to him: "How large an army do you think I could lead?" "Not more than 100,000 men, your Majesty." "And you?" asked the Emperor. "Oh!" he answered, "the more the better."] 1. Fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different from fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of
