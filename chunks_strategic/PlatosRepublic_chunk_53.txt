of the arguments themselves, I would distrust you. And the more I trust you, the more I'm at a loss as to what I should do. On the one hand, I can't help out. For in my opinion rm not capable of it; my proof is that when I thought I showed in what I said to Thrasymachus that justice is better than injustice, you didn't accept it from me. On the other hand, I can't not help out. For rm afraid it might be impious to be here when justice is being spoken badly of and give up and not bring help while I am still breathing and able to make a sound. So the best thing is to suc? cour her as I am able." Glaucon and the others begged me in every way to help out and not to give up the argument, but rather to seek out what each is and the truth about the benefit of both. So I spoke my opinion. "It looks to me as though the investigation we are undertaking is no ordinary thing, but one for a man who sees sharply. Since we're not clever men," I said, "in my opinion we should make this kind of investigation of it: if someone had, for example, ordered men who don't see very sharply to read little letters from afar and then someone had the thought that the same letters are somewh,ere else also, but big- ger and in a bigger place, I suppose it would look like a godsend to be able to consider the littler ones after having read these first, if, of course, they do happen to be the same." "Most certainly," said Adeimantus. "But, Socrates, what do you notice in the investigation of the just that's like this?" 'Tll tell you," I said. "There is, we say, justice of one man; and there is, surely, justice of a whole city too?" "Certainly," he said. "Is a city bigger23 than one man?" "Yes, it is bigger;" he said. "So then, perhaps there would be more justice in the bigger and it would be easier to observe closely. If you want, first we'll investigate ,vhat justice is like in the cities. Then, we'll also go on to consider it in individuals, considering the likeness of the bigger in the idea24 of the littler?" "What you say seems fine to me," he said. "If we should watch a city coming into being in speech," I said, "would we also see its justice coming into being, and its injustice?" "Probably," he said. "When this has been done, can we hope to see what we're looking for more easily?" ï¿½ "Far more easily." "Is it resolved25 that we must try to carry this out? I suppose it's no small job, so consider it." , "It's been considered," said Adeimantus. "Don't do anything else." "Well, then," I said, "a city, as I believe, comes into being be- 368 i d 369 a b 369 b
