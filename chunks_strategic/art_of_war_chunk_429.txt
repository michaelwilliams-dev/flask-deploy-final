destroy the fortified turrets mentioned in the preceding note.] 5. The general, unable to control his irritation, will launch his men to the assault like swarming ants, [This vivid simile of Ts�ao Kung is taken from the spectacle of an army of ants climbing a wall. The meaning is that the general, losing patience at the long delay, may make a premature attempt to storm the place before his engines of war are ready.] with the result that one-third of his men are slain, while the town still remains untaken. Such are the disastrous effects of a siege. CHAPTER 4. ATTACK BY STRATAGEM 39 [We are reminded of the terrible losses of the Japanese before Port Arthur, in the most recent siege which history has to record.] 6. Therefore the skillful leader subdues the enemy�s troops without any fight- ing; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field. [Chia Lin notes that he only overthrows the Government, but does no harm to individuals. The classical instance is Wu Wang, who after having put an end to the Yin dynasty was acclaimed "Father and mother of the people."] 7. With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire, and thus, without losing a man, his triumph will be complete. [Owing to the double meanings in the Chinese text, the latter part of the sentence is susceptible of quite a different meaning: "And thus, the weapon not being blunted by use, its keenness remains perfect."] This is the method of attacking by stratagem. 8. It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the enemy�s one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack him; [Straightway, without waiting for any further advantage.] if twice as numerous, to divide our army into two. [Tu Mu takes exception to the saying; and at first sight, indeed, it appears to violate a fundamental principle of war. Ts�ao Kung, however, gives a clue to Sun Tzu�s meaning: "Being two to the enemy�s one, we may use one part of our army in the regular way, and the other for some special diversion." Chang Yu thus further elucidates the point: "If our force is twice as numerous as that of the enemy, it should be split up into two divisions, one to meet the enemy in front, and one to fall upon his rear; if he replies to the frontal attack, he may be crushed from behind; if to the rearward attack, he may be crushed in front." This is what is meant by saying that �one part may be used in the regular way, and the other for some special diversion.� Tu Mu does not understand that dividing one�s army is simply an irregular, just as concentrating it is the regular, strategical method, and he is too hasty in calling this a mistake."] 9. If equally matched, we can offer battle; [Li Ch�uan, followed by Ho Shih, gives
