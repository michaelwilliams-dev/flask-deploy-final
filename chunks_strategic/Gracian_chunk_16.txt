He is a great man who never allows himself to be in�uenced by the impressions of others. Self-re�ection is the school of wisdom. To know one's disposition and to allow for it, even going to the other extreme so as to �nd the juste milieu between nature and art. Self-knowledge is the beginning of self-improvement. There be some whose humours are so monstrous that they are always under the in�uence of one or other of them, and put them in place of their real inclinations. They are torn asunder by such disharmony and get involved in contradictory obligations. Such excesses not only destroy �rmness of will; all power of judgment gets lost, desire and knowledge pulling in opposite directions. Know how to Refuse. One ought not to give way in everything nor to everybody. To know how to refuse is therefore as important as to know how to consent. This is especially the case with men of position. All depends on the how. Some men's No is thought more of than the Yes of others: for a gilded No is more satisfactory than a dry Yes. There are some who always have No on their lips, whereby they make everything distasteful. No always comes �rst with them, and when sometimes they give way after all, it does them no good on account of the unpleasing herald. Your refusal need not be point-blank: let the disappointment come by degrees. Nor let the refusal be �nal; that would be to destroy dependence; let some spice of hope remain to soften the rejection. Let politeness compensate and �ne words supply the place of deeds. Yes and No are soon said, but give much to think over. lxxi Do not Vacillate. Let not your actions be abnormal either from disposition or a.ectation. An able man is always the same in his best qualities; he gets the credit of trustworthiness. If he changes, he does so for good reason or good consideration. In matters of conduct change is hateful. There are some who are di.erent every day; their intelligence varies, still more their will, and with this their fortune. Yesterday's white is to-day's black: to-day's No was yesterday's Yes. They always give the lie to their own credit and destroy their credit with others. Be Resolute. Bad execution of your designs does less harm than irresolution in forming them. Streams do less harm �owing than when dammed up. There are some men so in�rm of purpose that they always require direction from others, and this not on account of any perplexity, for they judge clearly, but from sheer incapacity for action. It needs some skill to �nd out di.culties, but more to �nd a way out of them. There are others who are never in straits . their clear judgment and determined character �t them for the highest callings: their intelligence tells them where to insert the thin end of the wedge, their resolution how to drive it home. They soon get through anything: as
