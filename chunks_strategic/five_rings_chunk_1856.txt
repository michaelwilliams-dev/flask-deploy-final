Weare,asitseems, considering notonlyhow acity,butalsoaluxurious city,comes intobeing. Perhaps that's notbad either. For inconsidering such acity too,wecould probably seeinwhatwayjustice andinjustice naturally grow incities. Now, the true^i city isinmyopinion theonewejustdescribed—a healthy city, asitwere. But, ifyouwant to,let'slook atafeverish city, too.Nothing stands intheway.Forthese things, asitseems, won't satisfy some, orthiswayoflife,butcouches, tables, andother furniture373 ^^ [49] sochates/glaucon there public 373a willbeadded, and, ofcourse, relishes, perfume, incense, courtesans andcakes— allsorts ofallofthem.

Isn't that so?" h "Yes," hesaid. "Then thecitymustbemade bigger again. Thishealthy one isn't adequate anymore, butmust already begorged with abulky mass of things, which arenotincities because ofnecessity— allthehunters and imitators, many concerned with figures and colors, many with music; andpoets and their helpers, rhapsodes, actors, choral dancers, con- tractors, andcraftsmen ofallsorts ofequipment, forfeminine adom- c ment aswell asother things.

"Ofcourse." d "Won't webeinmuch greater need ofdoctors ifwefollow this wayofliferather than theearlier one?" "Much greater." "And theland, ofcourse, which wasthen sufficient forfeeding the menwhowere then, willnowbesmall although itwas sufficient. Or howshould wesay it?" "Like that," hesaid. "Then mustwecutoffapiece ofourneighbors' land, ifweare going tohave sufficient forpasture and tillage, andthey inturnfrom ours, ifthey letthemselves gototheunlimited acquisition ofmoney, overstepping theboundary ofthenecessary?" g "Quite necessarily, Socrates," hesaid. "After thatwon'twegotowar asaconsequence, Glaucon? Or how will itbe?" "Like that," hesaid. "And let'snotyetsaywhether warworks evilorgood," Isaid, "but only thismuch, thatwehave initsturnfound theorigin of war— inthose things whose presence incities most ofallproduces evils both private andpublic." "Most certainly." "Now,myfriend, thecitymustbestillbigger, andnotbyasmall 374a number butbyawhole army, which willgooutanddobattle with in- [50 ] Book 11/373a-374e socRATEs/GLAuco^ vaders forallthewealth and allthethings wewere justnow talking 374 c about."
