Hence theremustbeagood initself, an ideaofthegood inwhich thegood things participate. Amandoesnot desire those things, butdesires thegood,which issomehow inthembut isnotthem.Thegood, however, must alsobeasuper idea,anidea of ideas, fortheother ideas, forexample, justice, man, beauty, arealso good. Therefore these other ideas, themany ideas, areparticipations in theoneideaofthegood. Since theideas are,thegood, then, isthe source ofbeing, butbeyond being, inthesense that itexists inaway different from theother beings. Thegood isthetranscendent principle ofthewhole, thecause ofthebeing ofthings andoftheapprehension ofbeing, uniting knower andknov^Ti, thelover ofthegoodandthegood things. Asexperienced byman, thegood isanoverpowering combina- tionofpleasure andknowledge. Socrates tellsGlaucon thatanaccount ofthegood cannot begiven tohim,because he,Socrates, isincapable ofgiving itandGlaucon is incapable ofunderstanding it.Butheagrees togivehimanaccount of theoffspring ofthegood, thesun.Thesun isthecause both ofthings being seeable andtheirbeing seen,and isalsothecause oftheexistence ofliving things. What thesun isinthevisible world, thegood isinthe intelligible world.Onthebasis ofwhatweknow ofthevisible world with itssun,wecanconjecture about theintelligible world with itsidea ofthegood. This Socrates doesbydrawing thedivided linewhich describes thebeing ofthings andthefaculties which apprehend them. Itshows that reality extends farbeyond anything thepractical man everdreams and that toknow itonemust use faculties never recognized bythepractical man.Thedivided line isasketch ofacos- moswhich cangiveground totheaspirations ofthephilosophic soul.

After initiating Glaucon intothemysteries ofthisdivine beauty, Socrates turns toanelaboration oftherelationship ofthephilosophic [402 ] Interpretive Essay soul tothecity.Thedivided linedescribed thesoul's progress from its lowest level ofcognition, imagination, totrust, thought, andfinally in- tellection, itshighest level. ButnowSocrates makes clear that this is notasimple movement depending onlyontalent and effort. There are powerful forces thatstand inthewayofthephilosophic quest. The discovery ofthatquest hasthecharacter ofaliberation frombondage. Inthemostmoving ofallhismany images, Socrates compares our sit- uation tothatofprisoners inacave.Wearesurrounded bydarkness, ouronlyaccess toourselves andtheworld coming from theobservation ofshadows onthewall. But, although there isdarkness, there is also alight inthecave; thepaleshadows wepossess aremade possible bythat light. Moreover, afewhuman beings canemerge from thecave. Our lives areacombination ofugliness andsublime possibility. TheEnlightenment, taken literally, believed thatthelight could bebrought intothecaveandtheshadows dispelled; men, inthat view, could liveinperfect light. ThisSocrates denies; thephilosopher doesnotbring light tothecave,heescapes intothelightandcanleada fewtoit;heisaguide, notatorchbearer. Theattempt toilluminate the cave isself-defeating: apart ofman craves theshadows. The light would bedimmed anddistorted; itwould notprovide realclarity with- inthecave.And, atthesame time, thosewhohave theurge toascend tothelightwould bediscouraged from theendeavor bythemyth, ap- parently based onreason, thatthere isnoother light towhich theycan ascend. Thus theonlysource ofliberation andinspiration vvould disap- pearfrom thecave.TheEnlightenment teaches thatthecavecanbe transformed; Socrates teaches that itmustbetranscended andthat this transcendence canbeaccomplished onlybyafew. Onlybyconstant reference back tothedivided linecanoneun- derstand thecave. Inwhat sense doesthecaverepresent thehuman sit- uation with respect toeducation? Theprisoners aresaidtobeinbonds andforced tolook atimages ofimages— shadows onthewall ofthe cave.Thelowest level ofthelinebelongs toshadows andreflections, andthefaculty which apprehends them iscalled imagination. This is thelevel ofdistorted andunclear images, andthefaculty related to them iscompletely unreliable. Tojudge ofimages onemustcompare them tothethings ofwhich they areimages. These latter arethethings ofwhich wehave anatural consciousness —^plants, animals, artifacts; etc.— thevarious manys ofwhichwebecome aware through thesenses.
