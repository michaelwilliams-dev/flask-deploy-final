not worth mentioning." "Yes, it is plain," he said, "even to a blind man." "So they'll be rid of all this and live a life more blessed than that most blessed one the Olympic victors live." "In what way?" "Surely the Olympic victors are considered happy for a small part of what belongs to these men. Their victory is not only fairer but the public support is more complete.25 The victory they win is the preservation of the whole city, and they are crowned with support and everything else necessary to life-ho they themselves and their chil? dren as well; and they get prizes from their city while they live and when they die receive a worthy burial." "That's very fine," he said. "Do you remember," I said, "that previously an argument-I don't know whose-reproached us with not making the guardians hap? py; they, for whom it's possible to have what belongs to the citizens, have nothing? We said, I believe, that if this should happen to come up at some point, we would consider it later, but that now we were making the guardians guardians and the city as happy as we could, but we were not looking exclusively to one group in it and forming it for hap? piness."

"26 "If he follows my advice," he said, ''he'll stay in this life." "Then," I said, "as we've described it, do you accept the corn. munity of the women with the men in education, children, and guard. ing the rest of the citizens; and that both when they are staying in the city and going out to war, they must guard and hunt together like dogs, and insofar as possible have everything in every way in common; and that in doing this they'll do what's best and nothing contrary to the nature of the female in her relationship with the male, nothing contrary to the natural community of the two with each other?" "I do accept it," he said. "Then," I said, "doesn't it remain to determine
