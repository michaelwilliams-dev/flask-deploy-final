Negotiation isthe insidious viper that will eatawayatyour victory,sogive yourenemies nothingtonegotiate,nohope,no room tomaneuver. Theyarecrushed andthat isthat. Realize this: Inyour struggleforpower you will stiruprivalries and create enemies. There will bepeople you cannot win over, who will re~ main your enemies nomatter what. Butwhatever wound youinflicted on them, deliberatelyornot, donottake their hatred personally. just recog» nize that there isnopossibilityofpeacebetweenyou, especiallyaslongas youstayinpower. Ifyouletthem stick around, they will seek revenge,as certainlyasnight follows day.Towait forthem toshow their cards isjust silly;asEmpress Wuunderstood, bythen itwill betoolate. Berealistic: With anenemylike thisaround, youwill never besecure. Remember the lessons ofhistory,and thewisdom ofMoses and Mao: Never gohalfway. Itisnot, ofcourse, aquestion ofmurder, itisaquestion ofbanishment. Sufficiently weakened and then exiled from yourcourt forever, yourene- mies arerendered harmless. They have nohope ofrecovering, insinuating themselves andhurting you. And iftheycannot bebanished, atleast un- derstand thattheyareplotting against you, andpaynoheed towhatever friendliness they feign. Your only weaponinsuch asituation isyourown war-iness. Ifyoucannot banish them immediately, then plotforthe best time toact. Image: AVipercrushed beneath your foot but left alive, will rearupand bite you with adouble dose of venom. Anenemythat is left around islike ahalf- deacl viperthatyounurse back tohealth. Time makes the venom grow stronger. Authority: For itmust be noted, that men must either be caressed orelse annihilated; they will revengethemselves forsmall injuries,but cannot do soforgreat ones; theinjury therefore that wedotoaman must besuch that weneed not fear hisvengeance. {Niccolo Machiavelli, 1469-1527} LAW 15 ;113 114 LAW 13REVERSAL This lawshouldvery rarelybeignored,butitdoes sometimes happen that itisbetter toletyourenemiesdestroy themselves, ifsuch athingispossi- ble, than tomake them suffer byyourhand. Inwarfare, forexample,a good general knows thatifheattacks anarmywhen itiscornered, itssol- diers willfightmuch more fiercely. Itissometimes better, then, toleave them anescape route, awayout Asthey retreat, theywear themselves out, and areultimatelymore demoralized bythe retreat than byanydefeat he might inflict onthebattlefield. Whenyouhave someone ontheropes, then——-but onlywhen youare suretheyhave nochance ofrecovery--you mightletthem hang themselves. Letthem betheagents oftheir own de- struction. The result will bethe same, andyouwon‘t feelhalf asbad. Finally,sometimes bycrushinganenemy, youembitter them somuch thatthey spend yearsandyears plotting revenge.TheTreaty ofVersailles had such aneffect ontheGermans. Some wouldarguethat inthelongrun itwould bebetter toshow some leniency.Theproblem is,your leniency involves another n'sk—itmayembolden theenemy, which still harbors a "grudge, but now has some room tooperate.Itisalmost alwayswiser to crushyour enemy.
