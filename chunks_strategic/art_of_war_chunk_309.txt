called �inside.�� In metaphorical terms, the �outside� is the obvious, the evident, the open and aboveboard; the �inside� is the subtle, the concealed, the ulterior or underhanded. The �outside� in this sense may also refer to common consensus, the �inside� to private or covert power. The point of defining these distinctions as they apply to a given situation is to match the nature of a feasible approach to fit the character of an accessible route in the process of pursuing chosen aims. �The straight and direct is called �rope,� while the crooked and tortuous is called �string.� When properly organized according to the character of the route, a battle formation does not get confused. Those on a straight way thrive, while those on a tortuous course half die.� It may be wondered why anyone would take a tortuous course with this understanding. The answer, aside from real or feigned incompetence, may simply be lack of choice, one of the primary motivations of warriors following the tradition of The Art of War. This aphorism applies to the moral dimension of behavior as well as the strategic aspect. Truth or honesty may seem inconvenient under certain circumstances, but the compensation is freedom from confusion and conservation of energy. The whole process of creating and maintaining false appearances to conceal and foster ulterior motives requires so much time and energy for its own operation that this preoccupation alone can become a motivation in itself that is powerful enough, however secondary it may be, to turn into a compulsive mode of behavior. �In general, when it comes to the matter of a battle ground, the sun is the essential element.� On an actual battlefield, the most advantageous position to occupy in relation to the sun is to have it at your back and in your opponent�s eyes. In metaphorical terms, as the source of light that makes it possible to maneuver, the sun stands for intelligence. Strategically, intelligence means reconnaissance and information as well as the specific means and methods of gathering, processing, and applying knowledge. The question that needs to be considered first is what sources and techniques of intelligence are practical under given conditions. �Wind may come from eight directions, and must not be forgotten.� Depending on its direction in relation to the direction of tactical maneuvers on a battlefield, wind affects vision, hearing, coordination, and stamina. Symbolically, wind is traditionally used to represent external influences that affect states of mind. The �eight winds� are gain and loss, censure and praise, honor and disgrace, pain and pleasure. Insofar as psychological states influence personal interaction and professional performance, the action of the �eight winds� must be considered in the course of organizing and managing a group work situation or developing and implementing an operational strategy of any kind. �Crossing water, heading up an incline, or going against the current of a river, camping on deadly ground, or facing woods, are equally worthy of note because these are not conducive to victory.� Crossing water
