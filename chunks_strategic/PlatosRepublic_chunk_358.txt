defenses. He begins by distinguishing the philosophers from the nonphilosophers. This distinction is made by referring to two sa1ient aspects of the philosopher. In the first place, he has a voracious appetite for all learning. His curiosity is not like that of a craftsman who learns only what is useful in the narrow sense and whose interest is limited by his craft. The philosopher learns as other men love-simply because it seems good and an end in itself; as a mat? ter of fact, learning is an erotic activity for him. Love of ]earning is another expression of man's eros, of his longing for completeness. Such a man wants to know everything, aware that no part can be understood without being considered in relation to the whole. Socrates simply describes that rare but revealing phenomenon, the theoretical man, he who proves the possibility of disinterested knowledge. He is the man who can preserve his disinterestedness even in the difficult human questions which concern him most immediately, because he is more at? tracted by clarity than life, satisfaction of desire, or honor. The philosopher introduces to the city a dimension of reason that had not been discerned in the earlier discussion of it. Glaucon objects that on the basis of this description of the philosopher, all the lovers of sights and hearing-particularly the lovers of the festivals where the poets display their dramas-would have to be considered philosophers. In response to this objection, Soc? rates defines the second salient characteristic f the philosopher: he is a lover of the one idea of each thing and not the many things which participate in the ideas, of being and not becoming, of knowledge and not opinion. Thus Socrates introduces the teaching for which he is most renowned and which constitutes the most difficult ï¿½part of his thought-the ideas. Here this teaching is presented to a young man who is not a philosopher in a context where it is not the primary con? cern. Hence the treatment of it is most inadequate, and the existence of the ideas is assumed rather than proved. Socrates only tries to satisfy Glaucon that the phi]osopher has concern for a rea1ity other than that of most men. In so doing, Socrates appeals particularly to Glaucon's own experience with the beautiful things he loves so much. That ex? perience shows Glaucon that all the beautiful things he knows are also in some ways ugly, and that what was once beautiful becomes ugly. These beautiful things seem to be understood to be beautiful in relation to some standard which is entirely beautiful, the approach to which makes them beautiful. That standard is beautifu], while the things which imitate it are and are not beautifu] at the same time. Things which come into being and pass away are only to the extent that they partake of what does not come into being or pass away. The ideas are the permanent ones behind the changing manys to which we apply the same
