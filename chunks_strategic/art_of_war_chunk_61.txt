obeyed." But there are circumstances which sometimes forbid a general to use these advantages. For instance, "a certain road may be the shortest way for him, but if he knows that it abounds in natural obstacles, or that the enemy has laid an ambush on it, he will not follow that road. A hostile force may be open to attack, but if he knows that it is hard-pressed and likely to fight with desperation, he will refrain from striking," and so on.] 7. Hence in the wise leader�s plans, considerations of advantage and of dis- advantage will be blended together. ["Whether in an advantageous position or a disadvantageous one," says Ts�ao Kung, "the opposite state should be always present to your mind."] 8. If our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way, we may succeed in accomplishing the essential part of our schemes. [Tu Mu says: "If we wish to wrest an advantage from the enemy, we must not fix our minds on that alone, but allow for the possibility of the enemy also doing some harm to us, and let this enter as a factor into our calcula- tions."] 9. If, on the other hand, in the midst of difficulties we are always ready to seize an advantage, we may extricate ourselves from misfortune. [Tu Mu says: "If I wish to extricate myself from a dangerous position, I must consider not only the enemy�s ability to injure me, but also my own ability to gain an advantage over the enemy. If in my counsels these two considerations are properly blended, I shall succeed in liberating myself.... For instance; if I am surrounded by the enemy and only think of effecting an escape, the nervelessness of my policy will incite my adversary to pur- sue and crush me; it would be far better to encourage my men to deliver a bold counter-attack, and use the advantage thus gained to free myself from the enemy�s toils." See the story of Ts�ao Ts�ao, VII. ss. 35, note.] 10. Reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage on them; 1. CHAPTER 9. VARIATION IN TACTICS 72 [Chia Lin enumerates several ways of inflicting this injury, some of which would only occur to the Oriental mind:�"Entice away the enemy�s best and wisest men, so that he may be left without counselors. Introduce traitors into his country, that the government policy may be rendered futile. Fo- ment intrigue and deceit, and thus sow dissension between the ruler and his ministers. By means of every artful contrivance, cause deterioration amongst his men and waste of his treasure. Corrupt his morals by in- sidious gifts leading him into excess. Disturb and unsettle his mind by presenting him with lovely women." Chang Yu (after Wang Hsi) makes a different interpretation of Sun Tzu here: "Get the enemy into a position where he must suffer injury, and he will submit of his own accord."] and make trouble for them, [Tu Mu, in this phrase, in his interpretation indicates that
