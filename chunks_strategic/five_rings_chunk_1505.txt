This was amuch better waytoemasculate them than killing them, which would onlyhave ledother generals toseekvengeance. And Sung would have nothingtodo with“friendly”ministers. More often than not,they would end updrinking hisfamouscupofpoisonedwine. Instead ofrelyingonfriends, Sungused hisenemies, one after the other, transforming them into farmore reliable subjects.

Friends will saythat they love your poetry,adore your music, envy yourtaste in clothes———maybe theymean it,often theydonot. Whenyoudecide tohire afriend, yougraduallydiscover thequalities heorshehaskept hidden. Strangely enough,itisyouractofkindness that unbalances everything.
