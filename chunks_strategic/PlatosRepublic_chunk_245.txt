of couches: one that is in nature, which we would say, I suppose, a god produced. Or who else?" "No one else, I suppose." "And then one that the carpenter produced." "Yes," he said. "And one that the painter produced, isn't that so?" "Let it be so." 597 a b 597 b C d e 598 a "Then painter, couchmaker, god-these three preside over three forms of couches." "Yes, three." "Now, the god, whether he didn't want to or whether some necessity was laid upon him not to produce more than one couch in nature, made only one, that very one which is a couch. And two or more such weren't naturally engendered by the god nor will they be begotten." "How's that?" he said. "Because," I said, "if he should make only two, again one would come to light the form of which they in tum would both possess, and that, and not the two, would be the couch that is." "Right," he said. "Then, I suppose, the god, knowing this and wanting to be a real maker of a couch that really is and not a certain couchmaker of a cer? tain couch, begot it as one by nature." "So it seems." "Do you want us to address him as its nature-begetter or some? thing of the kind?" "That's just at any rate," he said, "since by nature he has made both this and everything else." "And what about the carpenter? Isn't he a craftsman of a couch?" "Yes.ï¿½ "And is the painter also a craftsman and maker of such a thing?" "Not at all." "But what of a couch will you say he is?" "In my opinion," he said, "he would most sensibly be addressed as an imitator of that of which these others are craftsmen." "All right," I said, "do you, then, call the man at the third genera? tion from nature an imitator?" "Most certainly," he said. "Therefore this will also apply to the maker of tragedy, if he is an imitator; he is naturally third from a king and the truth, as are all the other imitators." "Probably." "Then we have agreed about the imitator. Now tell me this about the painter. In your opinion, does he in each case attempt to imitate the thing itself in nature, or the works of the craftsmen?" "The works of the craftsmen," he said. "Such as they are or such as they look? For you still have to make this further distinction." "How do you mean?" he said. "Like this. Does a couch, if you observe it from the side, or from the front, or from anywhere else, differ at all from itself? Or does it not differ at all but only look different, and similarly with the rest?" "The latter is so," he said. "It looks different, but isn't." "Now consider this very point. Toward which is painting directed in each case-toward imitation of the being as it is or toward its looking as it looks?
