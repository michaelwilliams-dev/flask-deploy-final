Hetried tohelp Halliwell launch acareer asanartist, even arrangingfor agallerytoshow hiswork, buttheshow was aflop, and thisonly heightenedHalliwell’s sense ofinferiority.InMayof1967, the pair went on abrief holiday togetherinTangier,Morocco. Duringthetrip, Orton wrote inhisdiary,“We satmilking ofhowhappywefelt. And how it couldn’t, surely, last. We’d have topayforit.Orwe’d bestruck down from afarbydisaster because wewere, perhaps,toohappy.Tobeyoung, good- looking, healthy, famous, comparativelyrich andhappyissurely going against nature.” Halliwell outwardly seemed ashappyasOrton. Inwardly, though, he wasseething. And two months later, intheearly morning ofAugust 10, 1967, justdaysafterhelpingOrton putthefinishingtouches tothewicked fa»ceWhat theButler Saw(undoubtedlyhismasterpiece),Kenneth Halliwell bludgeoned joe Orton todeath with repeatedblows ofahammer tothe head. Hethen tooktwenty—0ne sleeping pillsand died himself, leaving be- hind anote thatread, “Ifyouread Orton’s diaryallwill beexplained.” Interpretation Kenneth Halliwell had tried tocast hisdeterioration asmental illness, but what joe Orton’s diaries revealed tohim was thetruth: Itwasenvy, pure andsimple,thatlayattheheart ofhissickness. The diaries, which Halli- well read onthesly,recounted thecouple’s daysasequalsand their strug- gleforrecognition. After Orton found success, the diaries beganto describe Halliwell’s brooding, hisrude comments atparties,hisgrowing sense ofinferiority.AllofthisOrton narrated with adistance that bordered oncontempt. The diaries made clear Halliwe1l’s bitterness over Orton’s success. Eventuallytheonly thingthat would have satisfied him would have been forOrton tohave afailure ofhisown, anunsuccessful play perhaps,sothat theycould have commiserated intheir failure, astheyhad done years be fore. When theopposite happened—as Orton grew onlymore successful andpopular—Halliwell did theonly thing that would make them equals again: Hemade them equalsindeath. With Orton’s murder, hebecame al- most asfamous ashisfriend——posthumously. JoeOrton onlypartlyunderstood hisl0ver’s deterioration. Hisattempt tohelp Halliwell launch acareer inartregistered forwhat itwas: charity andguiltOrton basicallyhad twopossiblesolutions totheproblem.He could have downplayedhis own success, displayingsome faults, deflecting I-Ialliwell’s envy; or, once herealized the nature oftheproblem,hecould have fled asifHalliwell were aviper,asinfact hewas—a viperofenvy. Onceenvyeatsawayatsomeone, everything you doonlymakes itgrow, anddaybydayitfesters inside him. Eventuallyhewill attack. Onlyaminoritycan succeed atthegameoflife, and thatminorityin- evitablyarouses theenvy ofthose around them. Once success happens your way, however, thepeopletofear the most arethose inyourown ctr» cle,thefriends andacquaintances youhave leftbehind. Feelings ofinferi- ority gnawatthem; thethought ofyoursuccess only heightens their feel— ings ofstagnation. Envy, which thephilosopher Kierkegaardcalls “on- happy admiration,” takes hold. You may not seeitbutyou will feel it someday—unless, that is,you learn strategies ofdeflection, little sacrifices tothegods ofsuccess.

Never underestimate the power ofenvy. OBSERVANCE OFTHE LAW The merchant class and the craft guildstowhich medieval Florence owed itsprosperityhad created arepublic thatprotected them from oppression bythenobility.Since highoffice could onlybeheld for afewmonths, no one could gain lasting dominance, andalthoughthis meant that thepoliti calfactions struggled constantlyforcontrol, thesystem kept outtyrants andpettydictators. The Medici family lived forseveral centuries under this system without makingmuch of amark. Theyhad modest originsas apothecaries,and were typical middle-class citizens. Notuntil thelate four- teenth century,when Giovanni de’Medici made amodest fortune inbank ing,didthey emergeasaforce tobereckoned with.
