fornotbeing agood liberal, isnowshunned fornotbeing a wholehearted communitarian. He is,however, back inthegame. But,above all,thePlatonic text isnowgripping because ofitsvery [viii] Preface totheSecond Edition radical, more than up-to-date treatment ofthe"gender question." Ina stunning demonstration ofthepower ofthephilosophic imagination, Plato treats thequestion asitwasnever again treated uptoourownday— proving thereby thatreason canpenetrate totheessentials atanytime or place. /Perfect justice, Socrates argues inthedialogue, canbeachieved only bysuppression ofthedistinction between thesexes inallimportant matters andtheadmission ofwomen onanequal footing toallactivities ofthecity, particularly themost important, fighting andthinking. Corollary tothis is thevirtual suppression ofthebodily differences between thesexesand all thepsychic affects habitually accompanying those differences, especially shame, which effectively separates women frommen.J Inconsequence, Socrates further recognizes thatthere mustbea revolution inthefamily inwhich itsfunctions aretransferred tothe community, sothatwomen willnothave tobear thedouble burden of career mothers. Day-care centers, abortion, andthedesacralization of marriage areonlyafewoftheeasily recognizable elements ofthisrevolu- tion infavor ofsynthesizing theopposites man/woman intotheunity, human being. Some activists even find Socrates' analysis tooradical, sacrificing allthecharms offamily tiestorational considerations ofjustice. Reason, itseems, iscorrosive ofthemysteries ofhuman connectedness. Others rightly suspect thatSocrates isnotsufficiently convinced ofthe factual equality ofwomen. Socrates isagain thequestionable ally,buthe marks thestarting point ofsomething thatwould beunimaginable ifhehad notthought itthrough. Onecansearch inother historical epochs and cultures, butthefoundations ofthisperspective v^dllnotbefound else- where. They areinextricably linked tothefounder ofpolitical philosophy. Forstudents thestory ofmanbound inthecaveandbreaking the bonds, moving outandupintothelightofthesun, isthemostmemorable from theirencounter withtheRepublic. This istheimage ofevery serious student's profoundest longing, thelonging forliberation fromconvention inorder toliveaccording tonature, andoneofthebook's evidently permanent aspects. Thestory stillexercises some ofitsoldmagic, but it nowencounters afresh obstacle, forthemeaning ofthestory isthattruth is substituted formyth. Today students aretaught thatnosuch substitution is possible andthatthere isnothing beyond myth or"narrative." Themyths ofthemost primitive cultures arenot, itissaid, qualitatively different from thenarratives ofthemost rigorous science. Menandwomen mustbend to thepower ofmythrather than trytoshuck itoffasphilosophy wrongly used tobelieve. Socrates, who gailyabandons thefounding myth ornoble liehe himseff madeupforthesakeofthecity,looks quixotic inthislight. Thiscan bedisheartening totheyoung person who cares, but itcanbeabeginning ofphilosophy, forheisperplexed byarealdifficulty inhisownbreast. This isanother casewhere Platonic radicalism isparticularly timely forus. [ix] Preface totheSecond Edition Finally, interms ofmyownexperience ofthese lasttwenty-five years, aftertheRepublic Itranslated Rousseau's Emile, thegreatest modem book oneducation. Rousseau wasoneofthegreat readers ofPlato, andfrommy timeonthatwork Igained aneven greater respect fortheRepublic. Emile isitsnatural companion, andRousseau proved hisgreatness byentering the listsinworthy combat with it.Heshows thatPlato articulated firstand best alltheproblems, andhehimself differs onlywithrespect tosome of thesolutions. Ifonetakes thetwobooks together, onehasthebasic training necessary fortheeducational wars.Andwarsthey are,now thatdoctrine tellsusthatthese twobooks arecornerstones ofanoutlived canon. So, I conclude, theRepublic isalways useful tostudents whoread it,butnow more than ever. Ihave corrected many minor mistranslations ormisleading formula- tions forthissecond edition. Imust alsoaddthatthere arecertainly many more Ididnotcatch. This isregrettable butinherent inthenature ofthe taskandthenature ofthistranslator. Paris, iggi [X] PREFACE This isintended tobealiteral translation. Mygoal—unattained— wasthe accuracy ofWilliam ofMoerbeke's Latin translations ofAristotle. These versions aresofaithful toAristotle's textthatthey areauthorities for thecorrection oftheGreek manuscripts, andtheyenabled Thomas Aquinas tobecome asupreme interpreter ofAristotle without knowing Greek. Such atranslation isintended tobeuseful totheserious student, theonewhowishes and isable toarrive athisownunderstanding of thework.Hemustbeemancipated from thetyranny ofthetranslator, given themeans oftranscending thelimitations ofthetranslator's inter- pretation, enabled todiscover thesubtleties oftheelusive original. The onlyway toprovide thereader with thisindependence isbyaslavish, even ifsometimes cumbersome, literalness— insofar aspossible always using thesame English equivalent forthesameGreek word. Thus the little difficulties which adduptomajor discoveries become
