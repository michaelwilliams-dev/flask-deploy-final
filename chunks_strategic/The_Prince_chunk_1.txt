n answering that our next publication would be a new translation of The Prince by Machiavelli , my acquaint. ance , a public school teacher, became puzzled . "What do you know about the Prince ?� "From which literature , the French or the English?" She had heard of the title , but was unable to identify it readily. "The Prince is by Machiavelli, from Florence , Italy.� "What do you know about him?� "He's the bad guy. Our politicians learn how to scheme and how to cheat from him... a bad dude , not one to have in my house ." "What else do you know about him? For instance , have you actually read his Prince, or any other works , including his plays?" "Plays? I didn't know he wrote plays . I haven't read them . � I had more or less a similar dialogue with an older professor recently retired from a leading institution of higher learning.

With editions published throughout the world, the name Machiavelli is becoming more famous, more relevant, and more accepted. Because of this relevancy, politicians read him and keep ap.plying or adhering to his principles of governing. But like Saint Peter reneging Christ, they will not admit to an intellectual or po.litical connection to the founder of Social Science. Machiavelli, whose life and works are based on the Roman concept of virtue, would not subscribe to opposites of virtue and we do not see traces to classify him as lacking in virtue. This be.ing the case, how did he get the reputation wherein being Ma.chiavellian connotes being evil, scheming, and dissimulating?
