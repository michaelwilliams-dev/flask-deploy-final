areseveral tales ofmenwhodied andlaterbecame gods; notable among themwere Heracles, Pollux, andAscle- pius. 7.This refers toagame, intheplaying ofwhich agroup isdivided into twopartsâ€” onewhich runsawayandtheanother which gives chase.Who does what isdetermined bytwirling ashell,onesideofwhich isblack andtheother white. Twirling theshell isequivalent totossing acoin (cf.Phaedrus, 241b). 8.403a, 416d.A"champion" isanathlete, generally arunner, whowins theprize.TheGreek isathletes, therootofwhich istheword for"prize." 9.This isaterm that refers todrama, inparticular, tothechorus. Itis either amovement ofthedancers from lefttoright, corresponding toapre- viousmovement from right toleft(thestrophe), orthesongthey singwhile performing theirmovement. 10.Palamedes wasaherooftheTrojanWarandwassupposed tohave invented thealphabet, numbers, lighthouses, andmany other useful things.He does notappear inHomer, butAeschylus, Sophocles, andEuripides each wrote tragedies about him,none ofwhich areextant. 11.The little finger, theindex, andthemiddle. 12.InGreek mathematics thestudy ofnumbers and their attributes (arithmetike) isdistinguished from that ofcalculation (logistike), which involves operations withnumbers (addition, subtraction, etc.). 13.Socrates gives aname tothecity:theGreek isCallipolis. There were towns ofthatname (cfHerodotus, VII, 154). 14.This isamilitary term, asaresomany intheconversation with Glaucon. 15.Literally, "increase." Theplane wasunderstood tobetheincrease from apoint, andthesolid theincrease from aplane. [465 ] THEREPUBLIC 16."Discovered" inthiscontext probably means thattheproblems had notbeen adequately formulated andthat decisive oneshadnotyetbeen solved. Socrates indicates thatinhistime solidgeometry wasinastate similar tothatofplane geometry prior toPythagoras. 17.Cf.Aristophanes, Clouds, 170-173, where thesame term isused. 18.Theword isdemiurge, meaning "amanwho practices anartforthe public." Intheexalted sense ofthispassage, hebecomes thecraftsman ofthe cosmos oftheTimaeus andthelater tradition. Itsoriginal humble sense isnot tobeforgotten. 19.Ancient musicians measured theconcordant intervals (forexample, fourth, fifth,andoctave) andgavethem mathematical proportions onthe basis ofthelength ofthestrings required toproduce them. 20.Atechnical term inmusic, hereprobably meaning notes theinter- valsofwhich aresosmall astobealmost inaudible; condensed orcombined notes.Theword initsoriginal sense refers toclothwhich hastightly woven threads. 21.Thecomparison istothejudicial torture ofslaves ontherack. 22.Nomos (cf.365e, note 18). 23.TheGreek (hodos) means "away" or"apath" (cf.532e). None of theartshasawayoftreating being assuch, buteach sees itinaparticular perspective; their particular ways areappropriate only totheir particular sub- jectmatters. Hence some other discipline isneeded, thesolebusiness ofwhich isthestudy ofbeing. 24.TheGreek isborhoroi barbarikoi. 25.Inallbutoneofthemanuscripts there follows asentence ofwhich there areseveral versions, nonewholly intelligible. Hence Ihave left itoutof thetranslation. Itspoint isapparently that iftheclarity ofthename mirrors theclarity ofthesoul intheparticular faculty, Glaucon willbecontent. 26.Without trying tointerpret thedeeper meaning ofthisexpression, it canbestated that itprobably refers tothemathematical problem addressed in theMeno. Itisagreat shock todiscover thatthediagonal ofasquare isnot commensurable with itssides; onlyanirrational number canexpress therela- tionship. This raises far-reaching questions about therelation ofphysical and geometrical reality tomathematical rationality. Such lines areirrational, not able togiveanaccount ofthemselves intheterms ofwhole numbers. This is thediscovery ofthePythagorean theorem. 27.Theword issynopsis, "aseeing together." 28.There isapunon"steadfast" {monirrios) and"established bylaw" {nomimos}. Thephrase isanalliterative jingle. 29.Cf.390a, note 31. 30.Flattery probably means anappeal tothepleasant asopposed tothe good (cf.Gorgias, 463b). 31.Theword for"demon" isdaimoh and that for"happy" iseu- daim'on, "possessing agooddemon."
