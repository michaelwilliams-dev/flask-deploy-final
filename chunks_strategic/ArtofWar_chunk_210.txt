pressing your contention, you return to order and change. Remain steadfast for good fortune.� In a strategic reconstruction of this principle, the chapter on �Doing Battle� in The Art of War says, �It is never beneficial to a nation to have a military operation continue for a long time. Therefore those who are not thoroughly aware of the disadvantages in the use of arms cannot be thoroughly aware in the advantages in the use of arms.� Again using an idealistic ethical framework of interpretation, Cheng Yi explains that the contentious person within a duly established power structure has no one to contend with justly, therefore not pressing contention is a social duty. Returning to order, according to Cheng, means overcoming the emotions that feed contentiousness, so as to change the mentality to an evenminded, objective view of true facts. When this more positive attitude is stabilized, there is normally better luck in social relations and consequent conflict resolution and avoidance. Cheng Yi goes on to say, �Order means real truth; if you lose real truth, that is to go against order. So coming back to order is returning to truth. Ancient classics speak of the more obvious manifestations and consequences of going against order in terms of the brutalization and destruction of peoples.� The Art of War says, �A nation destroyed cannot be restored to existence, the dead cannot be restored to life,� merging utilitarian strategy and humanitarian ethics to conclude that in cases of contention �to win without fighting is best.� Cheng Yi continues: �The point is that when strength is not balanced correctly it behaves impulsively; it does not stay peacefully in place. Because it is not balanced correctly it is not steady; and it is precisely this insecurity that makes it contentious. If you do not press any contention that you should not press, and go back to find out the real truth, you will change insecurity into security, which is fortunate.� The fifth element of the �Contention� hexagram represents a strong and balanced leadership able to settle contention. The statement reads, �The contention is very auspicious.� Cheng Yi interprets thusly: �Settling contention in a way that is balanced accurately is the way to results that are very auspicious and completely good.� He also warns that the object of contention is not victory by any means, or at any cost: �Remember,� he writes, �that there are cases where people are very lucky but the results are not entirely good.� Projecting the concept of �auspicious contention� into the domain of crisis management, in the chapter on �Planning a Siege� The Art of War says, �Those who win every battle are not really skillful�those who render others� armies helpless without fighting are the best of all.� In terms that can be seen as ethical, yet even when purely utilitarian still translate into humanitarian practicalities on the battlefield, The Art of War also says, �Act when it is beneficial, desist if it is not,� and �do not fight when there
