more time and opportunity. They are not all in accord and besides, are being paid by you. A third of them depend directly on your authority and are not likely to of.fend you. To summarize, mercenaries are dangerous because of 82 � Niccol� Machiavelli their cowardice, while auxiliaries are dangerous when they are brave. A wise Prince therefore avoids dependence on these forces and relies on his own. Better to lose with his forces than win with arms of others, judging victory not real when acquired with the arms of others. I cannot cease citing Cesare Borgia and his deeds. He entered Romagna with auxiliaries, leading the all-French troops in. With them, he took Imola and Forl�. But, suspecting his own security, he turned to mercenaries, believing them to be less dangerous. He turned to the Orsini and Vitelli, got rid of them, and fell back on his own forces. You can judge the difference in of the with the such forces by measuring the reputation Duke French, then with the Orsini and Vitelli, and then on his own. His reputation only Increased and he was never admired more, than when he was seen in command of his own forces. I don't want to wander from fresh Italian examples, but I don't want to forget Gerone II (265-215 B.C.), tyrant of Syracuse, al.ready mentioned. Gerone, made captain of the army by the Syra.cusans, realized that the mercenaries were useless � so he had them cut to pieces, and then waged war with his own men and not with aliens. I want to remind you in this regard of a figure from the Old Testament. David offered to Saul to combat Goliath, the troublesome Philistine. Saul offered David help � his troops. But David refused, saying he couldn't count on them. He preferred to confront the enemy with his sling and dagger. troops and The arms of others either hang heavy, turn against you, or force you. Charles VII (1422-1461), King of France, father of Louis XI, by valor and fortune having liberated France from the English, realized this need and conscripted citizens and infantry. His son Louis dismissed the infantry and relied on Swiss mercenaries. These two errors, as we saw, led to dangers to his realm. By rais.ing the Swiss, he undermined his own troops. He dismissed his infantry and put the other troops under Swiss leadership. Grow-the of ing accustomed to superiority the Swiss, the French thought they couldn't win without them. Thereafter the French could not resist the Swiss. Without the Swiss, they couldn't pre THE PRINCE � 83 vail against others. French armies became mixed � part their own, part mercenary. These armies, although better than auxilia.ries and one hundred per cent mercenaries, were not as good as native troops. This example suffices, because Charles' order if had prevailed France would have been unbeatable. Meager hu.man prudence is thus corrupted and begins something thinking it is good without realizing the secret poison underneath. Whoever ruling a
