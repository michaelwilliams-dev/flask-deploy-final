In the course of the numerous combats in which he engaged, Musashi was never once mistaken in his assessment of the strength of his adversaries, which is what made it possible for him to avoid defeat. He never lost a fight and doubtless achieved the highest level of his time. We can also draw the conclusion that if he judged certain opponents to possibly be superior to himself, he avoided fighting with them for as long as he had not succeeded in turning the situation in his favor. For Musashi, discernment of incisive rigor must be the basis of strategy, individual or collective. In the situation of a duel, the mikiri of three centimeters determines the ma and decides the issue of the bout. Mikiri extended to large-scale strategy distills in one word one of the teachings of Sun Tsu: �If you know yourself and you know your enemy, you will not lose one fight in a hundred.� This rigorous discernment characterizes the sword of Musashi as well as his artistic expression. 71. �Think of that which is not evil,� yokoshima ni naki koto o omou: The Japanese expression here contains a nuance of double negation: �Think of that which is not good.� Another translation, corresponding to a second sense of the term yokoshima, is possible: �Think of that which does not deviate from the way.� 1. 72. �Method,� ho: Ho means �law, rule, manner� or �method, model.� It is also a Buddhist term meaning �teaching of the Buddha.� In this sentence Musashi uses ho to refer back to hyoho, thus to his teaching as a whole; that is why I translated this term as �method.� A bit earlier he uses this term to refer to the precepts he had formulated. The sense of the term being clearly limited there, I translated it �rules.� 73. �You maintain your vital energy constantly . . . ,� ki ni hyoho o taesazu: A more literal translation would be: �In your ki, you do not interrupt strategy.� Inversion can serve to reinforce the meaning of an expression. 74. �You have free mastery of your body,� sotai yawaraka nareba: The more usual reading of the ideograms is jiyu, which means �free.� But in the text of the Gorin no sho handed down in the Hosokawa family, which is today considered to be the one closest to the original and which I use as my basic text, these ideograms, in this passage, are transcribed without annotation, while in another passage of the Scroll of Water they are accompanied by an annotation in katakana: yawaraka. In the Ihon gorin no sho by Yamada Jirokichi, this sentence is written differently: Sotai yawarakani jiyu ni nari. (14, p. 365) Thus it contains both the words yawaraka and jiyu. The meanings of these words are as follows: Jiyu means �pursuing freedom of the mind or thought.� In its Buddhist sense, it means �without any constraint.� Yawaraka means �being flexible, gentle, docile.� Yawara is also pronounced ju. It is �the
