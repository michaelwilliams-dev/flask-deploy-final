we were searching for gold we would never willingly make way for one another in the search and ruin our chances of finding it; so don't suppose that when we are seeking for justice, a thing more preci.ous than a great deal of gold, we would ever ï¿½ foolishly give in to one another and not be as serious as we can be about bringing it to light. Don't you suppose that, my friend! Rather, as I suppose, we are not competent. So it's surely far more fitting for us to be pitied by you clever men than to be treated harshly." He listened, burst out laughing very scornfully, and said, "Heracles! Here is that habitual irony of Socrates. I knew it, and I pre? dicted to these fellows that you wouldn't be willing to answer, that you would be ironic and do anything rather than answer if someone asked you something." "That's because you are wise, Thrasymachus," I said. "Hence you knew quite well that if you asked someone how much twelve is and in asking told him beforehand, 'See to it you don't tell me, you human being, that it is two times six, or three times four, or six times two, or four times three; I won't accept such nonsense from you'-it was plain to you, I suppose, that no one would answer a man who asks in this way. And if he asked, 'Thrasymachus, what do you mean? Shall I answer none of those you mentioned before? Even if it happens to be one of these, shall I say something other than the truth, you surprising man? Or what do you mean?'-what would you say to him in re? sponse?" "Very well," he said, "as if this case were similar to the other." "Nothing prevents it from being," I said. "And even granting that it's not similar, but looks Jike it is to the man who is asked, do you think he'H any the Jess answer what appears to him, whether we forbid him to or not?" "WeH, is that what you are going to do?'' he said. "Are you going to give as an answer one of those I forbid?" "I shouldn't be surprised," I said, "if that were my opinion upon consideration." "What if I could show you another answer about justice besides all these and better than they are?" he said. "What punishment do you think you would deserve to suffer?" "What else than the one it is fitting for a man who does not know to suffer?" I said. "And surely it is fitting for him to learn from the man who knows. So this is what I think I deserve to suffer." "That's because you are an agreeable chap!" he said. "But in ad? dition to learning, pay a fine in money too." "When I get some," I said. "He has some," said Glaucon. "Now, for money's sake, speak, Thrasymachus. We shall all contribute for Socrates."31 "I certainly b lieve it,"
