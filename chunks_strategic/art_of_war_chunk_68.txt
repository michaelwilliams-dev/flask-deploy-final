[Chang Yu�s explanation is doubtless right: "When birds that are flying along in a straight line suddenly shoot upwards, it means that soldiers are in ambush at the spot beneath."] Startled beasts indicate that a sudden attack is coming. 23. When there is dust rising in a high column, it is the sign of chariots ad- vancing; when the dust is low, but spread over a wide area, it betokens the approach of infantry. ["High and sharp," or rising to a peak, is of course somewhat exaggerated as applied to dust. The commentators explain the phenomenon by saying that horses and chariots, being heavier than men, raise more dust, and also follow one another in the same wheel-track, whereas foot-soldiers would be marching in ranks, many abreast. According to Chang Yu, "every army on the march must have scouts some way in advance, who on sighting dust raised by the enemy, will gallop back and report it to the commander-in- chief." Cf. Gen. Baden-Powell: "As you move along, say, in a hostile country, your eyes should be looking afar for the enemy or any signs of him: figures, dust rising, birds getting up, glitter of arms, etc."1 ] When it branches out in different directions, it shows that parties have been sent to collect firewood. A few clouds of dust moving to and fro signify that the army is encamping. [Chang Yu says: "In apportioning the defenses for a cantonment, light horse will be sent out to survey the position and ascertain the weak and strong points all along its circumference. Hence the small quantity of dust and its motion."] 24. Humble words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is about to advance. ["As though they stood in great fear of us," says Tu Mu. "Their object is to make us contemptuous and careless, after which they will attack us." Chang Yu alludes to the story of T�ien Tan of the Ch�i-mo against the Yen forces, led by Ch�i Chieh. In ch. 82 of the SHIH CHI we read: "T�ien Tan openly said: �My only fear is that the Yen army may cut off the noses of their Ch�i prisoners and place them in the front rank to fight against us; that would be the undoing of our city.� The other side being informed of this speech, at once acted on the suggestion; but those within the city were enraged at seeing their fellow-countrymen thus mutilated, and fearing only lest they should fall into the enemy�s hands, were nerved to defend them- selves more obstinately than ever. Once again T�ien Tan sent back conver- ted spies who reported these words to the enemy: "What I dread most is 1"Aids to Scouting," p. 26. CHAPTER 10.
