when he realized thathis own life and his own failed attempts to write the great novel was actually thesubject he was looking for, it all poured out of him and into one of the greatestnovels ever written, In Search of Lost Time.This is The Primary Law of the Creative Dynamic that you must engravedeeply in your mind and never forget: your emotional commitment to what youare doing will be translated directly into your work. If you go at your work withhalf a heart, it will show in the lackluster results and in the laggard way in whichyou reach the end.
