These twogenerals begantheir careers asfriends, fightingonthe same side. Hsiang Yu came from the no- bility; large andpowerful, giventobouts ofviolence andtemper,abitdull- witted, hewasyetamightywarrior who always foughtatthehead ofhis troops.LiuPangcame from peasant stock. Hehad never been much ofa soldier, andpreferredwomen and wine tofighting;infact, hewas some thing ofascoundrel. But he waswily,and hehad theabilitytorecognize thebest strategists, keepthem ashisadvisers, and listen totheir advice. He had risen inthearmy through these strengths. In208 13.0., theking ofCh’u sent two massive armies toconquerthe powerful kingdom ofCh’in. Onearmywent north, under thegeneralship ofSung Yi,with HsiangYusecond incommand; theother, ledbyLiu Pang, headed straight toward Ch’in. The targetwas thekingdom’s splendid capital, Hsien-yang. And Hsiang Yu, ever violent andimpatient,could not stand theidea that LiuPang would gettoHsietryang first, andperhaps would assume command oftheentire anny. Atonepointonthenorthern front, Hsiang’s commander, Sung Yi, hesitated insendinghistroopsinto battle. Furious, Hsiangentered Sung Yi’s tent, proclaimed him atraitor, cutoffhishead, and assumed sole com~ mand ofthearmy.Without waiting fororders, heleftthenorthern front and marched directlyonHsien—yang.Hefeltcertain hewas thebetter sol- dier andgeneralthan Liu,but, tohisutter astonishment, hisrival, leadinga smaller, swifterarmy, managedtoreach Hsien-yangfirst. Hsianghad an adviser, FanTseng,who warned him, “This villageheadman [Liu Fang] used tobegreedy only forriches and women, but since entering thecapital hehas notbeen ledastray bywealth, wine, orsex. That shows heisaiming high.” FanTseng urged Hsiangtokillhisrival before itwas toolate. Hetold thegeneral toinvite thewily peasanttoabanquetattheir camp outside Hsien-yang, and, inthemidst ofacelebratorysword dance, tohave his head outoff.The invitation was sent; Liufellforthetrap,and came tothe banquet.ButI-Isianghesitated inorderingthesword dance, andbythe time hegave thesignal,Liuhad sensed atrap,andmanaged toescape. “Bah!” cried FanTsengindisgust, seeing thatHsiang had botched theplot. “One cannot planwith 3.simpleton. LiuPang will stealyour empire yet and make usallhisprisoners." Realizing hismistake,
