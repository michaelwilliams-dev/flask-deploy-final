HOW TO WIN ONE tates ,and all dominions that have orhave had sway over people ,have been orare either Republics orPrincipalities . Principalities are either hereditary ,transmitted by family blood ,orthey are new .New Principalities are either cut from new cloth completely ,aswas the Principality ofMilan for Fran- cesco Sforza ,orthey are new parts added tothe holdings ofthe Prince that acquires them — aswas the Kingdoms ofNaples and ofSicily for the King ofSpain .Such dominions are acquired , whether they were accustomed to living under aPrince ,or whether they lived free - and they are acquired either with the arms ofothers orwith one's own ,either by fortune orbyvalor . SOFHEREDITARY PRINCES ettingwithPrincipality elsewhere,aside theand,discussionIdevelopingshall turnofmyRepublics,theattentionargument whichexclusivelyoutlinedIhaveintodealt thethe first chapter above, Iwillconsider how thePrincipality canbe governed andsustained. Inhereditary states ruled byabloodline there arefewer diffi- culties ofrulethan innew states, because itisenough nottodi- verge from theoldorder andtotemporize against unforeseen de- velopments. Doing this, even anordinary Prince canmaintain his state, unless anextraordinary happening deprives himofit—and even then, assoon ashisfoeruns intotrouble, hecaneasily gain back hisPrincipality. InItaly wehave good examples ofthissuch astheDuke of Ferrara, who withstood theattack oftheVenetians in1484 andof Pope Julius IIin1510 fornoother reason than having along he- reditary claim. This isbecause anatural Prince with along he- reditary lineislesslikely togive offense; heismore likely tobe appreciated; andifheisnotgiven tovices thatmake himhated, it ispretty usual forhimtobeheld inhissubjects' affections. Tradition andcustom ofruledims thememory andthecauses oftheoriginal risetopower —otherwise, onechange only leads toanother ifmemories ofchange arenotforgotten. ItMIXED PRINCIPALITIES evenisiniftheanew PrincipalityPrincipality that thedifficulty arises. Firstly, isnotcompletely new, butanew part ofone—andthiswecancallamixed Principality —then thepossibility ofchanges arise from aproblem natural toallnew Principalities: namely, thatmen change leaders gladly inhopes of improvement intheir lot.This belief leads them totake arms against thenew leader too,because they have been deceived and seefrom experience thatthings have gotten worse. This happens usually andquite necessarily because anew leader always of- fends hisnewsubjects either byusing force orbyother injustices associated with theacquisition ofanew Principality. Obviously, those youoffend become your enemies. You cannot satisfy your friends either because their expectations aredisappointed too,or canyouoppose them since they helped you. Indeed, even ifyou arewell armed, whenever youenter anew province youneed the help ofprovincial leaders. This waswhy Louis XIIin1499 first took Milan, then lostitin1500. Getting help atfirstfrom Ludo- vico theBlack's own forces, these forces soon sawthattheywere deceived, thattheir hopes were betrayed, andthatthey could not putupwith thetroubles ofthenew Prince. However, ifyouwintherebel people back asecond time itis easier tohold ontotheprovince. This isbecause thePrince, now aware oftherebelliousness, islessquick topunish delinquents, hold suspects, ortomove against theweak. ForFrance tolose Milan thefirsttime in1500 itonly took Duke Lodovico rumbling around alittle intheprovince, buttolose itthesecond time in 1511 ittook thewhole world against them, andFrance's armies, exhausted, fledtoItaly. This happened because ofwhat wesaid above. Whatever —both times Milan wastaken back. Imentioned thereasons forthefirst loss. Itremains tosay 34— Niccolò Machiavelli what remedy France might have hadandwhat aPrince inthose circumstances might have done toprevent France's second loss. Ishould point outwhen oneadds anewstate totheold,either itbelongs tothesame province already andhasthesame lan- guage, oritdoesn't. When itdoes, itismuch easier tohold onto, especially ifitisnotaccustomed tofreedom. Allittakes istodis- ruptthedynastic lineofformer rulers, otherwise maintaining the oldcustoms.
