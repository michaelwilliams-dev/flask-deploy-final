With allof Polemarchus' admiration forjustice, itisnotthehighest thing, not sought forassuch. Justice ismore ofameans totheendofpreserving lifeandproperty than itself theendofagood life. Polemarchus' definition ofjustice might beregarded astherulereq- uisite tothesatisfaction ofcollective selfishness: beloyal tothemem- bersofyourowngroup sothatyoucanbesttakeadvantage oftheout- siders. And, inprinciple, there isnoreason why thisselfishness should notbeextended totheindividual ifjustice isnotgood initself. This iswhy Socrates isable toclaim that this definition, which seems sogentle- manly, istheproduct ofarichtyrant: ifwealth isthegoal,thenthebest way toattain itisbybreaking allfaithandseizing power inone's city andconquering asmany nations asonecan.Only ifjusticeJs_arL_end, not^xaeans, isitreasonable tobeunremittingly just. There isatension inPolemarchus —ofwhich heisunaware— be- tween hisloveofproperty andhisloveofjustice. This iswhat Socrates exposes andwhatThrasymachus isabout toexploit. Justice, Thrasyma- chus says, isthemorality ofaband ofrobbers who areface tofacewith their victims, andonly asimpleton would beduped intomaking some- thingmore ofit.Polemarchus isinanuntenable position somewhere between utter selfishness and total dedication tothecommon good. Gentlemanly morality isself-contradictory, andthegoods desired by thegentlemen would, ifhewere clear-sighted, lead inthedirection of tyranny. Thrasymachus continues ontheroad toit,aroad towhich Soc- rates' questions have directed him. (336b-354b) Thrasymachus bursts violently intothediscussion. He isangry because Socrates andPolemarchus hadbeenengaged ina [325 ] THEREPUBLIC dialogue. Hesees this asaform ofweakness. The participants ina dialogue obey certain rules which, likelaws, govern their association- they seek acommon agreement instead oftrying towin avictory. Thevery artofdialectic seems toimpose akind ofjustice onthose who practice it,whereas rhetoric, theartofmaking long speeches without being questioned— Thrasymachus' art— isadapted toself- aggrandizement. Thrasymachus sees dialectic asanopponent of rhetoric andwishes toshow hisaudience thesuperiority ofrhetoric. Moreover, Thrasymachus objects tothesubstance aswell astheform ofwhat hehasjustheard. Justice asdoing good toothers fitsinwell with theself-abnegation ofdialectic and isjust asunsound. Itis foolishness, thedirect opposite ofprudence, which causes aman to hold theposition thatjustice isdoing good toothers while also sup- posing that itisgood forthedoer.Thrasymachus adopts theaccents of moral indignation inthecause ofimmorality. Hecharges Socrates with wrongdoing, withdeceiving othermen; since Socrates' method isirony, heisadissembler orahypocrite. Heimposes ahigher good, inwhich hehimself doesnotbelieve, andwould causemenand cities toneglect theirneeds and interests.i Thrasymachus wishes topunish Socrates, and, inabook teeming with allusions toSocrates' accusation and trial,Thrasymachus makes themost explicit condemnation ofSocrates; hisinsistence that Soc- rates, ifbested byThrasymachus, propose anappropriate punishment forhimself prefigures that fateful daywhen thecondemned Socrates is forced bytheAthenian lawtopropose hisown penalty. ToThrasyma- chus, ashewill totheAthenian jurors, Socrates claims thathehasno money; andnow, asthey willthen, hisfriends offer toprovide himwith thenecessary funds. Thrasymachus andthecityarebothangry atSoc- rates fornotaccepting their point ofview, which appears tobeas clear asday.Theterms ofthetwoaccusations seem tobedifferent, but itsoonbecomes evident thatThrasymachus' definition ofjustice is really thesame asthecity'sandthatheactsasitsrepresentative. For, as soon asheasserts thatthejust istheadvantage ofthestronger, heex- plains thatbythe"stronger" hemeans thosewhoholdpower inacity andconstitute itssovereign, whether thatsovereign consists ofthepeo- ple,therich, thewell-born, orasingle man.The just iswhatever the sovereign initslaws says isjust.This isprecisely what thecity says, andSocrates isdisloyal toboth cityandThrasymachus insuggesting thatjustice goesbeyond thelaw— thatlawmaynotevenbenecessary if wisemen rule.This isanotion that isnotonly antilegal, but is,inpar- ticular, antidemocratic, because itlooks tothefewwise rather than the many free.Thrasymachus insists thatthedecree ofthesovereign isul- [326 ] Interpretive Essay timate, andthatthere isnorecourse beyond it,while Socrates insists thatlaws arejustonly totheextent theyconform toastandard of justice superior tothelawsandindependent ofthewishes ofthe sovereign. Thrasymachus' identification with thecity's view ofjustice helps toexplain hispreviously mentioned moral indignation inthecause of immorality, which alsohas itscounterpart intheactions ofthecity. The city insists that itslaws arejustandpunishes thosewhobreak them. Anger seems
