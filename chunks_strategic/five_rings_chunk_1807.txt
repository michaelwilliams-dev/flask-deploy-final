Often onewho strays from what heactu- allydoes andwhat heshould ideally dorisks ruin. Hewho wants always todogood often wrecks himself among those who arenot good. Wherefore itbehooves aPrince who wants tomaintain his position tolearn how tonotbegood, andtousethegood ornot useitaccording totheneeds. So,never mind theimaginary Prince. Let's talkabout real ones. Allmen, andparticularly Princes, who areraised above them, display qualities, which draw praise orblame. Some are considered liberal, others miserly (the Tuscan term, nottosay avaricious —which implies rapaciously taking what belongs to others, while miserly means notspending what onealready has). Some areconsidered generous, others avaricious, some cruel, others compassionate, some faithless, others faithful, some ef- feminate, others pusillanimous, some humane, others proud, some lascivious, others chaste, some loyal, others astute, some 88— Niccolò Machiavelli hard, others soft, some somber, others lighthearted, some reli- gious, others non- believers —andsoon. Iknow people willsayitwould bepraiseworthy foraPrince topossess allthose above qualities thatareconsidered good. But because they can’t have them allnorpractice them allsince the human condition doesn't allow it,itisneedful foraPrince tobe prudent andknow how toescape theinfamy ofthose vices that would upset thestate andthose which hecanavoid. Butifhe can’t, heneeds toknow which vices willhurthimorthestate the least. Hebest avoid those vices thatwillsurely compromise the state. Allthings considered there willbetraits considered good that, iffollowed, willlead toruin, while other traits considered vices which ifpracticed achieve security andwell being forthe Prince. SCONCERNING LIBERALITY AND PARSIMONY tarting from theabove, liberality isgenerally considered good.harmful. Nonetheless,As,usually liberality,practiced, asvirtuously,itisusually asitpracticed,should be,is liberality isnotrecognized; itdoes notprotect you against charges ofavarice. Towinfrom men praise forliberality, you need toexercise sumptuousness atevery opportunity. Thetrouble isostentation willconsume enormous amounts ofspending. To keep upthereputation ofliberality, thePrince willhave toexer- cisestrong fiscal policies anddoallhecantoraise money. This willturnthepopulace against him. When heispoor, noonewill admire him. Having offended everyone andpleased only afew, hebecomes vulnerable. When herealizes thisandtries tochange course, hegetsareputation formiserliness. APrince cannot exercise liberality without damage tohimself inthepublic eye,sohehastobrace himself against being known asstingy. Intime, hewillbeknown forliberality because hispar- simony will preserve hisassets, andhewill beable todefend himself inwar andundertake projects without leaning onthe populace. That way those who give, who aremany innumber, willseehimasexercising liberality, while those towhom hedoes give, who arefew, aretheonly ones who willseehimasamiser. Inourtimes nogreat things have been done except bythose who were perceived asmisers. Theothers faded away. Pope Julius II, exploiting areputation forliberality toreach thepapacy, didn't keep upthispretence tomake war. TheKing ofFrance waged many wars without special taxes bypracticing steadfast parsi- mony. The current King ofSpain hadhebeen reputed liberal would nothave won many ofhisundertakings. SoaPrince hastobear thereputation ofbeing stingy ifheis 90— Niccolò Machiavelli tonotrobhissubjects, ifheistodefend them, ifheisnotbecome poor, ifheisnottobecome rapacious. Itisavice thathelps him rule. Ifsomeone objects, thatCeasar practiced liberality tobe- come emperor, andmany others asPrince oftherealm ortowina Princedom. Intheformer case, liberality isharmful; inthelatter case, itisnecessary. Ceasar needed topractice liberality towin thePrincipality ofRome, butonce established, ifhehadnot abated thespending, hewould have ruined theEmpire. Ifsome- onealleges thatmany Princes who have done great things with thearmies have been considered liberal, then Ianswer, thePrince either spends hisown orhissubject’s goods, orhespends the goods ofothers. Intheformer case hewillhave tobeparsimoni- ous, inthesecond situation heshould skimp innoway. APrince who travels with thearmies andlives offtheprey,
