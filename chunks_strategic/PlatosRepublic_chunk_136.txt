whether after all it is possible, as it is among other animals, that this community come into being among human beings too, and in what way it is possible?" "You were just ahead of me," he said, "in mentioning what I was going to take up." "For, as to war," I said, "I suppose it's plain how they'll make war." "How?" he said. "That they'll carry out their campaigns in common, and, besides, they'll lead all the hardy children to the war, so that, like the children of the other craftsmen, they can see what they'll have to do in their craft when they are grown up. Besides seeing, they'll help out and serve in the whole business of war, and care for their fathers and mothers. Or haven't you noticed in the other arts that, for example, potters' sons look on as helpers for a long time before putting their hands to the wheel?" "Quite so." "Must they be more careful than the guardians in educating their children by experience and observation of their duties?" "That would be quite ridiculous," he said. "And further, every animal fights exceptionally hard in the pres? ence of its offspring." "That's so. But, Socrates, there's no small risk that in defeats, which are of course likely in war, they will lose the children along with themselves and make it impossible even for the rest of the city to recover." "What you say is true," I said. "But do you believe that one must first provide for the avoidance of all risks?" "Not at all." "And what about this? Since risks must presumably be run, shouldn't it be those from which they will emerge better men when sue- 467 l cessful?" "Plainly." "But do you suppose it makes only a small difference, and one not c worth a risk, whether children who are to be men skilled in war look on the business of war or not?" "No, itï¿½does make a difference for what you are talking about." "Then this must be the beginning, making the children spectators of war. And, if we further contrive something for their security, every? thing will be fine. Won't it?" "Yes.,, "In the first place," I said, "won't their fathers, insofar as is hu? man, be not ignorant but knowledgeable about all the campaigns that are risky and all that are not?" d "It's likely," he said. "Then they'll lead them to the ones and beware of the others." "Right." "And as rulers," I said, "they'll presumably set over them not the most ordinary men but those adequate by experience and age to be leaders and tutors."27 "Yes, tha f s proper." "But, we'll say, many things for many men also turn out contrary to their opinions." "Indeed." "Therefore, in view of such things, my friend, they'll have to be equipped with wings right away as little children, so that, if need be, they can fly and get away." "How do you mean?" he said. "At the earliest
