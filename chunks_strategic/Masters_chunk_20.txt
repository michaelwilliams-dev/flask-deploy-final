He had been able to test out his ideas on how to engineer large-scale projects; he would apply this knowledge elsewhere. Anyway, he didn�t care so much about the finished product; it was the search and process in creating something that had always excited him. Reflecting on his life in this way, he would have clearly detected the workings of some kind of hidden force within him. As a child this force had drawn him to the wildest part of the landscape, where he could observe the most intense and dramatic variety of life. This same force compelled him to steal paper from his father and devote his time to sketching. It pushed him to experiment while working for Verrocchio. It guided him away from the courts of Florence and the insecure egos that flourished among artists. It compelled him to an extreme of boldness�the gigantic sculptures, the attempt to fly, the dissection of hundreds of corpses for his anatomical studies�all to discover the essence of life itself.

He had faithfully followed its guidance to the very end and, having completed his course, now it was time to die. Perhaps his own words, written years before in his notebook, would have come back to him in such a moment: �Just as a well-filled day brings blessed sleep, so a well-employed life brings a blessed death.� KEYS TO MASTERY Among his various possible beings each man always finds one which is his genuine and authentic being. The voice which calls him to that authentic being is what we call �vocation.� But the majority of men devote themselves to silencing that voice of the vocation and refusing to hear it. They manage to make a noise within themselves � to distract their own attention in order not to hear it; and they defraud themselves by substituting for their genuine selves a
