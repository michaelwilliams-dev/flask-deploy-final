propose to draw any inferences from these facts, beyond the general conclusion that Sun Tzu�s work cannot have come down to us in the shape in which it left his hands: chap. VIII is obviously defective and probably out of place, while XI seems to con- tain matter that has either been added by a later hand or ought to appear elsewhere.] 51. For it is the soldier�s disposition to offer an obstinate resistance when sur- rounded, to fight hard when he cannot help himself, and to obey promptly when he has fallen into danger. [Chang Yu alludes to the conduct of Pan Ch�ao�s devoted followers in 73 A.D. The story runs thus in the HOU HAN SHU, ch. 47: "When Pan Ch�ao arrived at Shan-shan, Kuang, the King of the country, received him at first with great politeness and respect; but shortly afterwards his be- havior underwent a sudden change, and he became remiss and negligent. Pan Ch�ao spoke about this to the officers of his suite: �Have you no- ticed,� he said, �that Kuang�s polite intentions are on the wane?

Now it happens that an ambassador from the Hsiung-no arrived in this kingdom only a few days ago, and the result is that the respectful courtesy extended towards us by our royal host has disappeared. Should this envoy prevail upon him to seize our party and hand us over to the Hsiung-no, our bones will become food for the wolves of the desert. What are we to do?� With one accord, the officers replied: �Standing as we do in peril of our lives, we will follow our commander through life and death.� For the sequel of this adventure, see chap.
