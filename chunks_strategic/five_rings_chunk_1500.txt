Let usexamine thesituation. Theevening oftheparty,asFouquet pre- sented spectacleonspectacletoLouis, each more magnificent than the one before, heimaginedtheaffair asdemonstratinghisloyaltyand devotion to theking.Notonlydidhethink thepartywould puthim back intheking’s favor, hethought itwould show hisgood taste, hisconnections, and his popularity, makinghimindispensable totheking anddemonstratingthat hewould make anexcellent prime minister. Instead, however, each new spectacle,each appreciativesmile bestowed bytheguestsonFouquet, made itseem toLouis that his own friends and subjectswere more charmed bythefinance minister thanbytheking himself, andthatFouquet wasactually flauminghiswealth and power.Rather than flattering Louis XXV, Fouquet’selaborate party offended theking’s vanity.Louis would not admit this toanyone,ofcourse-—-instead, hefound aconvenient excuse to ridhimself ofaman who hadinadvertentlymade him feel insecure. Such isthefate, insome form orother, ofallthose who unbalance the master’s sense ofself,pokeholes inhisvanity,ormake him doubt hispro eminence. When thewming began, Fouquetwas attheto}:oftheworld. Bythetime ithad ended, hewas atthebottom. Voltaire, 16.944 778 OBSERVANCE OFTHE LAW Intheearly 1600s, theItalian astronomer and mathematician Galileo found himself inaprecarious position.Hedependedonthegenerosityof greatrulers tosupporthisresearch, and so,like allRenaissance scientists, hewould sometimes make gifts ofhisinventions and discoveries tothe leading patrons ofthetime. Once, forinstance, hepresentedamilitaiy compasshehad invented totheDuke ofGonzaga. Then hededicated a book explainingthe useofthecompass totheMedicis. Both rulers were grateful, andthroughthem Galileo was able tofind more students toteach. Nomatter how greatthediscovery, however, hispatrons usually paidhim withgifts,notcash. This made for alifeofconstant insecurityanddepen- dence. There must beaneasierway,hethought. Galileo hiton anew strategyinl6l0, when hediscovered the moons ofJupiter.Instead ofdividing thediscovery among hispatrons—giving onethetelescopehehadused, dedicatingabook toanother, and soon—as hehaddone inthepast,hedecided tofocus exclusivelyontheMedicis. He chose theMedicis for one reason: Shortlyafter Cosimo Ihad established theMedici dynasty,in1540, hehad made Jupiter,themightiestofthe gods, theMedici symbol—a symbol ofa.powerthat went beyond politics andbanking,onelinked toancient Rome and itsdivinities. Galileo turned hisdiscovery of_]upiter’smoons into acosmic event LAW 133 -1’ ,LAW]honoring theMedicis’ greatness. Shortlyafter thediscovery,heannounced that “thebrightstars [the moons ofjupiterl offered themselves intheheav~ ens” tohistelescopeatthe same time asCosimo II’senthronement. He said that thenumber ofthemoons-—-four——harmonized with thenumber of theMedicis (Cosimo IIhad three brothers) and that the moons orbitecl Jupiterasthese four sons revolved around Cosimo I,thedynasty’sfounder. More than coincidence, thisshowed that theheavens themselves reflected theascendancy oftheMedici family.After hededicated thediscoveryto theMedicis, Galileo commissioned anemblem representing Jupiter sitting on acloud with thefour stars circling about him, andpresentedthis to Cosimo IIasasymbolofhislink tothe stars. In1610 Cosimo IImade Galileo hisofficial court philosopherand mathematician, with afullsalary.For ascientist this was thecoup ofalife» time. Thedays ofbegging forpatronagewere over. Interpretation Inonestroke, Galileo gainedmore with his newstrategythan hehad in yearsofbegging. The reason issimple:All masters want toappearmore brilliant than other people. They donot care about science orempirical tmth orthelatest inven~ tion; theycare about their name and their glory.GalileogavetheMedicis infinitelymore glory bylinking their name with cosmic forces them hehad bymaking them thepatrons ofsome new scientific gadgetordiscovery. Scientists arenotsparedthevagaries ofcourt lifeandpatronage. They too must serve masters who hold thepurse strings.And their great intellec- tualpowerscan make the master feelinsecure, asifhewere onlythere to supplythe funds~—an ugly, ignoble job.The producerofagreatwork wants tofeelheismore thanjusttheprovider ofthefinancing. Hewants to appearcreative andpowerful,and also more important than theworkpro~ duoed inhis name. Instead ofinsecurity youmust give himglory.Galileo did notchallengetheintellectual authorityoftheMedicis with hisdiscov~ ery,ormake them feel inferior inany way; byliterally aligningthem with thestars, hemade them shine brilliantly amongthe courts ofItaly. Hedid notoutshine themaster, hemade themaster outshine allothers. KEYS TO POWER Everyonehas insecurities. Whenyoushow yourselfintheworld and dis-
