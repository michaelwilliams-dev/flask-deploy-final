We areallinastate oftotal dis- traction anddiffusion, hardlyable tokeepourminds inone direction be- fore we arepulledinathousand others. The modern world’s level of conflict ishigher than ever, and wehave internalized itinour own lives. The solution isaform ofretreat inside ourselves, tothepast,tomore concentrated forms ofthought and action. AsSchopenhauer wrote, “Intel- lect isamagnitudeofintensity,not amagnitude ofextensity.” Napoleon knew thevalue ofconcentrating yourforces attheenemy’s weakestspot—— itwasthe secret ofhis success onthebattlefield. Buthiswillpower and his mind were equally modeled onthis notion. Single-mindedness ofpurpose, total concentration onthegoal, and the useofthese qualifies against peo plelessfocused, peopleinastate ofdistraction—such anarrow will find its markeverytime and overwhelm theenemy. Casanova attributed his success inlifetohisabilitytoconcentrate on a single goalandpushatituntil ityielded. Itwas hisabilitytogive himself overcompletelytothe women hedesired that made him sointenselyse- ducfive. For the weeks ormonths that one ofthese women lived inhis orbit, hethoughtofnoone else. When hewasimprisonedinthetreacher- ous“leads” ofthedoge’s palaceinVenice, aprisonfrom which noone had everescaped,heconcentrated hismind onthesingle goalofescape, day after day. Achange ofcells, which meant that months ofdigginghad all been fornaught, did notdiscourage him; hepersistedandeventuallyes- caped.“Ihave always believed,” helater wrote, “that when amangetsit intohishead todosomething, and when heexclusively occupieshimself in thatdesign,hemust succeed, whatever thediliiculties. That man will be- come Grand Vizier orPope.” Concentrate C1asingle goal,asingle task, and beat itinto submission. Intheworld ofpower youwillconstantlyneed helpfrom other people, usuallythose more powerfulthanyou.The fool flitsfrom onepersontoan- other, believing that hewill survive byspreadinghimself out.Itisacorol- laryofthelawofconcentration, however, that muchenergyissaved, and more powerisattained, byaffixing yourselftoasingle, appropriatesource ofpower. The scientist Nikola Tesla. mined himself bybelievingthat he somehow maintained hisindependence bynothavingtoserve asingle master. He even turned down P.Morgan, who offered him arich con- tract. Intheend, Tesla’s “independence”meant that hecould dependon nosingle patron,but wasalways havingtotoady uptoadozen ofthem. Later inhislifeherealized hismistake. Allthegreat Renaissance paintersand writers wrestled with thisprob- lem, none more sothan thesixteenth-centurywriter Pietro Aretino. Throughout hislifeAretino suffered theindignitiesofhavingtopleasethis princeand that. Atlast, hehad hadenough,and decided towoo Charles V,promisingtheemperortheservices ofhispowerful pen.Hefinallydis- covered the freedom that came from attachment to asinglesource of power. Michelangelofound this freedom with Pope Julius II,Galileo with theMedicis. Intheend, thesingie patron appreciates your loyaltyand be- comes dependentonyour services; inthelongrun the master serves the slave. Finally, poweritself alwaysexists inconcentrated forms. Inany orga- nization itisinevitable for asmall youptohold thestrings. And often itis notthose with thetitles. Inthegameofpower, onlythefool llails about without fixing histarget. You must find outwho controls theoperations, who isthereal director behind the scenes. AsRichelieu discovered atthe beginningofhisrise tothetopoftheFrench politicalscene duringthe LAW 23 I75 I76 LAW 23early seventeenth century, itwas notKing Louis XIII who decided things, itwas theking’smother. And soheattached himself toher, andcatapulted throughtheranks ofthecourtiers, allthewaytothetop. Itisenoughtostrike oilonce—yourwealth andpowerareassured for alifetime. Image: The Arrow. You cannot hittwo targets with one arrow. Ifyour thoughts stray, you miss theenemy’sheart. Mind and arrow must become one. Only with such concentration of mental and physical powercanyourarrow hitthetargetand pierce the heart.
