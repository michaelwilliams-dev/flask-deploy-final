Thetermmusic isindeed adifficult oneforthemodern reader, but there hasbeen afulldiscussion ofitinseveral passages ofthe Republic, andanyotherwordwould surely bemost misleading. And, infact,thesensewegive tomusic isnottotally alien totheunderstand- ingGlaucon andAdeimantus had atthe start. ItisSocrates who transformed theirviewbyconcentrating onthespeech and itstruth while subordinating rhythm andharmony. ItisSocrates who ra- tionalized music. Isitnotconceivable thattheRepublic isabookmeant forpeople whoaregoing toreadwidely init,andthat itwould beunfair tocheat them forthesakeofthesubjective satisfaction ofthosewhopick out sentences aimlessly?

Only unawareness oftheproblems canaccount for such aperverse skewing oftheemphases. And thiswasasentence cho- senbyCornford todemonstrate theevident superiority ofhispro- cedure! There areawhole series offundamental teiTns likevirtue. Nature andcityarebuttwoofthemost important which aremost often mis- translated. Ihave tried toindicate anumber ofthem inthenoteswhen they firstoccur. They aretranslated astheyhavebeenbythegreat authors inthephilosophic tradition. Above all, Ihave avoided using terms ofrecent origin forwhich itisdifficult tofindanexactGreek equivalent, inasmuch asthey arelikely tobetheoneswhich most reflect specifically modem thought. Itis,ofcourse, impossible always [xvii] Preface totranslate every Greek word inthesame way.Buttheonlystandard forchange wastheabsolute unintelligibility oftherendition andnot anydesire tomake Plato sound better ortoaddvariety where hemight seem monotonous. And themost crucial words, likethose justmen- tioned andformandregime, etc.,arealways thesame inspite ofthe difficulties thisprocedure sometimes causes. Ordinarily incon- temporary translations theoccurrence of,forexample, nature inthe English isnoindication thatthere isanything related tophysis inthe Greek, andtheoccurrence ofphysis intheGreek does notregularly callforth anyword related tonature from thetranslator. But, since nature isthestandard forPlato, thisconfusion causes thereader either tobeignorant ofthefactthatnature isindeed Plato's standard orto mistake which phenomena heconsiders natural. Literal translation makes theRepublic adifficult book toread; but itisinitself adifficult bock, andourhistorical situation makes itdoubly difficult forus.This must notbehidden./Plato intended hisworks essentially forthe in- telligent andindustrious few, anatural aristocracy determined neither bybirth norwealthyand thistranslation attempts todonothing which would contradict that intention. Inaddition tounawareness oftheneed forprecision, unwill- ingness toaccept certain unpalatable orshocking statements orteach- ings isanother cause ofdeviation from literalness. This unwillingness isdueeither toarefusal tobelieve Plato sayswhathemeans ortoa desire tomakehimrespectable. Comford provides again aspectacular example ofanottoouncommon tendency. AtBook III414Socrates tellsoftheneed fora"noble lie"tobebelieved inthecityheand his companions arefounding (inspeech). Cornford calls ita"bold flight of invention' andadds thefollowing note: "This phrase iscommonly ren- dered 'noble lie,'aself-contradictory expression nomore applicable to Plato's harmless allegory than toaNew Testament parable orthe Pilgrim's Progress, andliable tosuggest thathewould countenance the lies, forthemost part ignoble, now called propaganda ..."{ibid., p. 106).ButSocrates calls italie.The diflference between aparable and thistale isthatthemanwhohears aparable isconscious that itisanin- vention thetruth ofwhich isnotinitsliteral expression, whereas the inhabitants ofSocrates' cityaretobelieve theuntrue story tobetrue. His ijjterlocutors areshocked bythenotion, but—according toCorn- ford—wearetobelieve itisharmless because itmight conjure up unpleasant associations. Thiswhole question oflying hasbeen carefully prepared byPlato from thevery outset, starting with thediscussion with oldCephalus (331 b-c). Itrecurs again with respect totheliesofthepoets (377 d).

Agood regime cannot bebased onenlighten- ment; ifthere isnolie,anumber ofcompromises— among them private property-^must bemade andhence
