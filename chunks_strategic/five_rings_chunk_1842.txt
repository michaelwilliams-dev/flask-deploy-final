"And isn'ttheart," Isaid, "naturally directed toward seeking and providing fortheadvantage ofeach?" "Yes, that iswhat itisdirected toward." "And isthere thenanyadvantage foreach oftheartsother than to beasperfect aspossible?" "How doyoumean thisquestion?" "Just as," Isaid, "ifyoushould askmewhether it'senough fora body tobeabody orwhether itneeds something else, Iwould say:'By allmeans, itneeds something else.And theartofmedicine hasnow been discovered because abody isdefective,^^ and itwon't dofor itto belike that.The artwasdevised forthepurpose ofproviding what is advantageous forabody.' Would Iseem toyoutospeak correctly in saying thatornot?" "You would," hesaid. "And what about medicine itself, isitoranyother artdefective, 342 anddoes itneedsome supplementary virtue?

Isitsoorotherwise?" "That's theway itlooks," hesaid. c "Then," Isaid, "medicine doesn't consider theadvantage of medicine, butofthebody." "Yes," hesaid. "Nor doeshorsemanship consider theadvantage ofhorsemanship, butofhorses. Nordoesanyother artconsider itsownadvantage —^for itdoesn't haveanyfurther needto—buttheadvantage ofthatofwhich itistheart." "Itlooks thatway," hesaid. "But, Thrasymachus, the arts ruleand aremasters ofthat of which they arearts." Heconceded thistoo,butwith agreat dealofresistance. "Then, there isnokind ofknowledge thatconsiders orcommands theadvantage ofthestronger, butrather ofwhat isweaker andruledby d it." Hefinally agreed tothis, too,although hetried toputupafight about it.When hehadagreed, Isaid: "Then, isn't itthecase thatthedoctor, insofar asheisadoctor, considers orcommands notthedoctor's advantage, butthatofthesick man? Forthedoctor intheprecise sensewasagreed tobearuler of bodies andnotamoney-maker. Wasn't itsoagreed?" Heassented. "Andwasthepilot intheprecise sense agreed tobearuler of sailors andnotasailor?" e "Itwasagreed." "Then such apilotandruler willconsider orcommand thebenefit notofthepilot, butofthemanwho isasailor and isruled." Heassented with resistance. "Therefore, Thrasymachus," Isaid, "there isn'teveranyone who holds anyposition ofrule, insofar ashe isruler,who considers or commands hisownadvantage rather than thatofwhat isruled andof which hehimself isthecraftsman; and itislooking tothisandwhat is [20] Book 11342a-344a socrates/thrasymachu! advantageous and fitting for itthathesayseverything hesaysanddoes 342 everything hedoes." Whenwecame tothispoint intheargument and itwasevident to 343 i everyone thattheargument about thejusthadturned around intheop- posite direction, Thrasymachus, instead ofanswering, said, "Tell me, Socrates, doyouhave awetnurse?" "Why this?" Isaid. "Shouldn't youanswer instead ofasking such things?" "Because," hesaid, "youknow sheneglects your sniveling nose anddoesn't give itthewiping youneed, since it'sherfaultyoudonot evenrecognize sheep orshepherd." "Because ofwhat, inparticular?" Isaid. "Because yousuppose shepherds orcowherds consider thegood ofthesheep orthecowsandfatten them andtakecareofthem looking tosomething other than their masters' goodandtheirown;andsoyou alsobelieve thattherulers inthe cities, thosewho truly rule, think about theruled differently from theway amanwould regard sheep, andthatnight anddaythey consider anything elsethanhowthey will benefit themselves. Andyouaresofaroffabout thejustandjustice, andtheunjust andinjustice, thatyouareunaware thatjustice andthe justarereally someone else's good, theadvantage ofthemanwho is stronger and rules, andapersonal harm tothemanwhoobeys and serves.
