commentary. It is suggested that before his interview with Ho Lu, Sun Tzu had only written the 13 chapters, but afterwards composed a sort of exegesis in the form of question and answer between himself and the King. Pi I-hsun, the author of the SUN TZU HSU LU, backs this up with a quotation from the WU YUEH CH�UN CH�IU: "The King of Wu summoned Sun Tzu, and asked him questions about the art of war. Each time he set forth a chapter of his work, the King could not find words enough to praise him." As he points out, if the whole work was expounded on the same scale as in the above- mentioned fragments, the total number of chapters could not fail to be considerable. Then the numerous other treatises attributed to Sun Tzu might be included. The fact that the HAN CHIH mentions no work of Sun Tzu except the 82 P�IEN, whereas the Sui and T�ang bibliographies give the titles of others in addition to the "13 chapters," is good proof, Pi I-hsun thinks, that all of these were contained in the 82 P�IEN. Without pinning our faith to the accuracy of details supplied by the WU YUEH CH�UN CH�IU, or admitting the genuineness of any of the treatises cited by Pi I-hsun, we may see in this theory a probable solution of the mystery. Between Ssu-ma Ch�ien and Pan Ku there was plenty of time for a luxuriant crop of forgeries to have grown up under the magic name of Sun Tzu, and the 82 P�IEN may very well represent a collected edition of these lumped together with the original work. It is also possible, though less likely, that some of them existed in the time of the earlier historian and were purposely ignored by him.15 12The passage I have put in brackets is omitted in the T�U SHU, and may be an interpolation. It was known, however to Chang Shou-chieh of the T�ang dynasty, and appears in the T�AI P�ING YU LAN. 13Ts�ao Kung seems to be thinking of the first part of chap. II, perhaps especially of ss. 8. 14See chap. XI. 15On the other hand, it is noteworthy that WU TZU, which is not in 6 chapters, has 48 assigned to it in the HAN CHIH. Likewise, the CHUNG YUNG is credited with 49 chapters, though now only in one only. In CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 10 Tu Mu�s conjecture seems to be based on a passage which states: "Wei Wu Ti strung together Sun Wu�s Art of War," which in turn may have resulted from a misun- derstanding of the final words of Ts�ao King�s preface. This, as Sun Hsing-yen points out, is only a modest way of saying that he made an explanatory paraphrase, or in other words, wrote a commentary on it. On the whole, this theory has met with very little acceptance. Thus, the SSU K�U CH�UAN SHU says: "The mention of the 13 chapters in the SHIH CHI
