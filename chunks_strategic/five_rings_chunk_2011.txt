sionofinjustice, which mustbediscerned ifitistobecompared to justice. But,hewillnotbepermitted tocontinue inthat direction, for hisinterlocutors arenotyetpersuaded that itisdesirable tobeamem- berofthis city,andwant toknowmore about it.The identification of thegood ofthesoulwith thatofthecityhasnotbeen convincing to them. This isunderstandable, since itispurely formal toassert thata justsoul isoneinwhich eachofitsparts does itsownworkwhen one doesnotknow thenature ofthose parts orprecisely what theirwork is. Itcannot beassumed merely thatthey exactly parallel theparts ofthe cityandtheirwork. Nothing asyethasindicated thatthemanwhohasahealthy soul willbeidentical withthecitizen oftheregime which hasbeen establish- ed.Isthewiseman,whomakes fulluseofthepowers ofhisreason, thesame astheprudent statesman, who issuescommands tothewar- riorsandtheartisans? Ishiscourage thatofthewarrior whoholds the belief thatwhat isgood forthecity isgood forhim,and isthuswilling todieonthebattlefield? Ishismoderation thatofanobedient subject, orthatofarulerwho cares forthecitizens andwishes torulethem for theirgood?Anddoes hisjustice consist indoing someworkwhich the cityprescribes tohimand isuseful toit?Affirmative answers toallor anyofthese questions seem highly improbable. Glaucon's realques- tion,however, waswhether hishappiness depended onbeing agood citizen, alaw-abiding man. Socrates tries togivetheimpression that there isaharmony between thejustice ofthecityandthatofmanby never suggesting thatthere might notbe. But itisaglaring problem, andSocrates' mode ofpresentation has rendered itevenmore obtrusive. Aswehave already observed, ifthe parallel ofcityandman istohold true,then aman, likethecity,should beinterested only inhimself andmerely useothers forhisown ad- vantage, asthecitydoes.And inthepresent discussion Socrates has made itappear thatthesoul's health canbeattained inisolation; asthe good city's neighbors were only ahindrance initsquest forthegood life,aman's neighbors might alsobeunderstood tobehindrances. In thatcase,hewould want tostrive forthegreatest self-sufBciency. This impression isintensified bythefactthat thebody, whose needs tiea man tohisfellows, hasbeen treated here asthough itdidnotexist.The parallel ofcityandmanpresented would tend tosupport theview that [378 ] Interpretive Essay thejustman— inthesense ofthemanwith ahealthy soul—would liot want tobeagood citizen inthegood city. Itwould alsoseem thathe would notwant tobeatyrant, forhisperfection seems tobeinde- pendent ofthecity.When Socrates points outthatamanwith ahealthy soulwould notbelikely tosteal deposits, break oaths, commit adultery, etc.,hedoesnotprove thatthejustindividual abstains fromsuchdeeds because herespects thelaws oreven cares forothermen.The factthat thejustmandoesnottrytotakeadvantage ofothermencould beas easily explained byalackofdesire fortheobjects involved asbyat- tachment tothecommon good. Indescribing theconduct ofsuchaman inrelation toothers, Socrates only tellsofthings hedoesnotdo,but never mentions anypositive deeds ofcitizen virtue which hedoes do.It would seem possible tobeajustmanwithout being ajust citizen, which goes further thananything Glaucon hadsuggested. The apparent answer tothequestion ofjustice hasonly heightened thedifficulty ofthatquestion, forwenowhave thejustcity andthejustsoul,andtheir relations areasmysterious asaretherela- tions ofbodyandsoul.Asaresult ofthespurious identification ofcity and soul, thenature ofthesoulhasemerged asthedecisive considera- tion intheunderstanding ofjustice. Given themagnitude ofthiscon- sideration, itisnowonder thatSocrates iseager, ashewas inthe beginning ofthedialogue, tohurry away. Itisalsonowonder that his companions once again jointogether tostophim, forheowesthem much more. (449a-473c) Inascene that recapitulates thebeginning ofthe dialogue, Polemarchus again joins withAdeimantus to"arrest" Soc- rates.They aremore formidable thistime, fortheyhavenowadded Glaucon andThrasymachus totheir ranks. Thedialogue begins anew. Socrates' companions have recognized, ifonly inaperipheral way, the incompleteness ofthediscussion ofthesoul,which they take tobean incompleteness ofthediscussion ofthecity.Theywant toknowmore about hisstatement that friends inthecityhave allthings incom- mon—including women andchildren— forthis total lack ofprivacy means thatamancannot have alifeofhiso\vn.Therefore aman's soul mustbesatisfied bythecommunity ornotbesatisfied atall.They ac- cuseSocrates ofacrime, ofdoing injustice byrobbing them ofapartof thediscussion. Andthey areright. Socrates wanted todohisduty to menandthecitywithout devoting himself tothem completely; hewas keeping hiswayoflifeprivate. Alltheothers could find their satisfac- tionanddignity inthecitythathasbeen established. ButcanSocrates? He iscompelled toappear before thebarofthat city;herehecannot [379 ] THEREPUBLIC giveamythical account ofhislife(ashedidintheApology) butmust explain himself ashereally is.This cityclaims tobethegreatest good formen, tocallforthehighest loyalty, tosatisfy thehuman potential.
