he also says, �Avoid keen energy, strike the slumping and receding.� To take full advantage of the principles of emptiness and fullness, Sun teaches four kinds of mastery essential to the uncanny warrior: mastery of energy, mastery of the heart, mastery of strength, and mastery of adaptation. The principles of emptiness and fullness also display the fundamental mechanism of the classic yin-yang principles on which they are based, that of reversion from one to the other at the extremes. Master Sun says, �Do not stop an army on its way home. A surrounded army must be given a way out. Do not press a desperate enemy.� The I Ching says, �The sovereign uses three chasers, letting the game ahead escape,� and �if you are too adamant, action is unlucky, even if you are right.� The eighth chapter of The Art of War is devoted to adaptation, already seen to be one of the cornerstones of the warrior�s art. Master Sun says, �If generals do not know how to adapt advantageously, even if they know the lay of the land they cannot take advantage of it.� The I Ching says, �Persist too intensely at what is currently beyond your depth, and your fidelity to that course will bring misfortune, no gain.� Adaptability naturally depends on readiness, another persistent theme of The Art of War. Master Sun says, �The rule of military operations is not to count on opponents not coming, but to rely on having ways of dealing with them; not to count on opponents not attacking, but to rely on having what cannot be attacked.� The I Ching says, �If you take on too much without a solid foundation, you will eventually be drained, leaving you with embarrassment and bad luck.� In The Art of War, readiness does not just mean material preparedness; without a suitable mental state, sheer physical power is not enough to guarantee victory. Master Sun here defines the psychological dimensions of the victorious leader indirectly, by enumerating five dangers�to be too willing to die, too eager to live, too quick to anger, too puritanical, or too sentimental. Any one of these excesses, he affirms, create vulnerabilities that can easily be exploited by canny opponents. The I Ching says, �When waiting on the fringes of a situation, before the appropriate time to go into action has arrived, be steady and avoid giving in to impulse�then you won�t go wrong.� The ninth chapter deals with maneuvering armies. Again Master Sun deals with all three aspects of the warrior�s art�the physical, social, and psychological. In concrete physical terms, he begins by recommending certain obvious types of terrain that enhance the odds of victory: high ground, upstream, the sunny side of hills, regions with plenty of resources. Referring to all three dimensions, he then describes ways of interpreting enemy movements. Although Master Sun never dismisses the weight of sheer numbers or material might, here as elsewhere there is the strong suggestion that social and psychological factors can overcome the sort
