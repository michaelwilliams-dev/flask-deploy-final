of Wei, Shu, and Wu competed for hegemony over the remains of the Chinese empire after the fall of the Han dynasty, at one point a general of Shu defected to Wei and was subsequently made military governor of an area called �New City.� Before long, however, the new governor established relations with the kingdom of Wu and transferred his allegiance back to Shu, rebelling against Wei. Now Sima Yi, a leading general of Wei, sent a secret military force to strike the traitor. His commanders said, �Now that he is connected with Shu, we should observe from a distance before making our move.� But the Wei general replied, �He is unreliable and lacks a sense of duty. This is a time when loyalties are in doubt, and we should hasten to resolve matters before he has settled down.� So the Wei troops traveled by forced marches day and night to arrive at the outskirts of New City. Both Wu and Shu sent reinforcements to help the defector, so the Wei general divided his forces to resist them. At the outset of these events, the defector had written to the chief strategist of Shu, �New City is so far away from the center of Wei that I will have my fortifications all ready by the time the emperor in Wei is informed of my actions. My commanders are well prepared, and my location is protected by natural barriers. The great general of Wei will surely not come himself, and even if his commanders come they cannot trouble me.� But then when the Wei force arrived, the defector informed the Shu strategist, expressing his suprise: �It has only been eight days since I made my move, and the Wei army is already at the city wall. How extraordinarily swift they are!� There was an outlying citadel surrounded on three sides by water, and the defector had a wooden barricade built outside for extra protection. The Wei troops, however, crossed the water and smashed the barricade, pressing right up to the city walls. On the tenth day, several of the defector�s own men assassinated him and opened the gates of the city, surrendering to the kingdom of Wei. Orderliness and Battle Liu Ji said: In warfare, if the enemy�s ranks are orderly on the move and the soldiers are calm, it will not do to enter into battle with them too readily. It is better to wait for a change or stir within them to strike; then you can win. The rule is �Avoiding confrontation with orderly ranks and not attacking great formations is mastering adaptation� (Sun Tzu, The Art of War, �Armed Struggle�). This story is related to the preceding story, about the general of the Three Kingdoms era who defected from Shu to Wei, became a military governor in outlying territory, then defected back to Shu but also had ties with Wu. At one point he even declared independence, with the diplomatic recognition of the king of Wu. According to
