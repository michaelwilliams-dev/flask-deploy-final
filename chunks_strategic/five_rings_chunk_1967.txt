Now togothrough themany things would take along time, Glaucon. Butthesum,hesaid,was this.For alltheunjust deeds theyhaddone anyone and allthemen towhom theyhaddone injustice, theyhadpaid thepenalty forevery oneinturn, tentimes over foreach.That is,they werepunished foreach injustice once every hundred years; taking this h asthelength ofhuman life, inthiswaytheycould payoffthepenalty fortheinjustice tentimes over. Thus, forexample, ifsomemenwere causes ofthedeath ofmany, either bybetraying cities orarmies and hadreduced men toslavery, orwere involved inanyother wrongdoing, they received foreach ofthese things tenfold sufferings; andagain, if theyhaddonegood deeds andhadproved justandholy, inthesame c measure didthey receive reward. Andabout thosewhowere only just bornandlived ashort time,hesaidother things notworth mentioning. Andhetoldofstillgreater wages forimpiety andpiety toward gods andparents andformurder. Forhesaidhewastherewhen oneman wasasked byanother, 'Where isArdiaeus theGreat?' ThisArdiaeus [298 ] BookXI614c-616e socrates hadbeen tyrant inacertain cityofPamphylia justathousand years 615c before thattime; hehad, aswas said, killed hisoldfather andelder brother anddonemany other unholy deeds." NowErsaid thatthe d man asked responded, 'Hehasn't come. Nor willhecome here,' he asserted. 'For thistoo,ofcourse, wasoneoftheterrible sightswesaw. Whenwewere nearthemouth about togoupandhadsuffered every- thing else,wesuddenly sawhimandothers. Justabout allofthemwere tyrants, buttherewere alsosome private men, ofthosewhohadcom- mitted great faults. They supposed theywere ready togoup,butthe e mouth didnotadmit thern; itroared when oneofthosewhose badness isincurable orwhohadnotpaid asufficient penalty attempted togo up.There weremen atthat place,' hesaid, 'fierce men, looking fiery through andthrough, standing byandobserving thesound, whotook hold ofsomeandledthem away, butwhobound Ardiaeus andothers hands, feet,andhead, threw themdown andstripped offtheir skin. 616a They dragged them along thewayside, carding them likewool on thorns; andthey indicated tothosewhocamebyforwhat reason this wasdoneandthatthesemenwould beledaway andthrown intoTar- tarus.' Theyhadexperienced many fears ofallkinds, hesaid,butmore extreme thananywasthefearthateachmanexperienced lestthesound come ashewent up;andwhen itwas silent, eachwentupwith the greatest delight. Suchthenwere thepenalties andpunishments; and,on theother hand, thebounties were theantistrophes ofthese. "When each group hadspent seven days intheplain, onthe b eighth theyweremade todepart from thereandcontinue their journey.
