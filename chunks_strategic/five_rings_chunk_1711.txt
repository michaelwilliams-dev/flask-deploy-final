cords——the Gordian knot—~would rule theworld. Manyhad tried tountie the enor mous and intricate knot, but none had succeeded. Alexander, seeing he could notpossiblyuntie theknot with hisbare hands, took outhissword andwith one slash cutitinhalf. This symbolic gesture showed theworld thathewould notdo asothers, butwould blaze hisown path. Against astounding odds, Alexander conquered thePersians. Most ex- pectedhim tostop there--it was agreat triumph, enough tosecure his fame foreternity.But Alexander had the same relationshiptohis own deeds ashehad tohisfather: Hisconquest ofPersia represented thepast, andhewanted never torest onpasttriumphs,ortoallow thepast toout- shine thepresent. Hemoved ontoIndia, extendinghisempire beyond all known limits. Onlyhisdisgruntled and weary soldiers prevented him from goingfarther. Interpretation Alexander representsanextremelyuncommon typeinhistory:the sonof afamous and successful man whomanagestosurpassthefather inglory andpower.The reason thistypeisuncommon issimple:The father most oftenmanagestoamass hisfortune, hiskingdom, because hebeginswith little ornothing. Adesperate urge irnpels him tosucceed»-he hasnothing tolosebycunningandimpetuousness, and has nofamous father ofhis own tocompete against.This kind ofman has reason tobelieve in himself-—-to believe that hisway ofdoing thingsisthebest, because, after all,itworked forhim. When aman likethis has ason, hebecomes domineering andoppres sive, imposinghislessons onthe son, who isstarting offlifeincircums stances totally different from those inwhich the father himself began.theszzttly (>Hzz.s','zrnfe.s'~ slim. /l_fn’r painzlrxg hart’ })t?{'()I)'l€ SL’l't')IId mfiure tohim.
