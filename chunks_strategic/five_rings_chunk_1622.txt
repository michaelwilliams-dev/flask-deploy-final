lived, aswedonow, inatime oftransformation: Organized religionwas onthewane, science ontherise. Peoplewere desperatetomllyaround anew cause orfaith. The Charlatans had begun bypeddlinghealth elixirs and alchernic shortcuts towealth. Moving quicklyfrom town totown, they originallyfocused onsmall groups—until, byaccident, theystumbled on atruth ofhuman nature: Thelarger thegroup they gatheredaround themselves, theeasier itwas to deceive. The charlatan would station himself on ahigh wooden platform (hence theterm “mountebank”) and crowds would swarm around him. Inagroup setting, peoplewere more emotional, less able toreason. Had thecharlatan spokentothem individually, theymight have found himridiculous, butlost inacrowd they gotcaught upinacommunal mood ofraptattention. Itbe came impossibleforthem tofind thedistance tobeskeptical, Anydeficien- cies inthecharlatan’s ideas were hidden bythezeal ofthe mass. Passion and enthusiasm swept throughthecrowd like acontagion,andtheyreacted violently toanyonewho dared tospreadaseed ofdoubt. Bothconsciously studyingthisdynamicover decades ofexperimentand spontaneously adaptingtothese situations asthey happened,thecharlatans perfectedthe science ofattractingandholdingacrowd, moldingthecrowd into followers and thefollowers into acult. Thegimmicks oftheCharlatans mayseem quaint today, but there are thousands ofcharlatansamongusstill,usingthe same tried~a:nd—true meth~ odstheir predecessors refined centuries ago,only changing the names of their elixirs andmodernizing thelook oftheir cults. Wefind these latter» daycharlatans inallarenas oflife-~business, fashion, politics,art.Many of them, perhaps,arefollowinginthecharlatan tradition without having any knowledge ofitshistory,butyoucan hemore systematicand deliberate. Simplyfollow thefivesteps ofcultmaking that ourcharlatan ancestorsper- fected over theyears. Step1:Keep ItVague; Keep ItSimple.Tocreate acultyou must first attract attention. This you should donotthrough actions, which are too clear andreadable, butthrough words, which arehazyanddeceptive.Your initial speeches, conversations, and interviews must include two elements: onthe one hand thepromise ofsomething greatandtransformative, and ontheother a.totalvagueness. This combination willstimulate allkinds of hazy dreams inyour listeners, who will make their own connections and seewhat theywant tosee. Tomakeyour vagueness attractive, usewords ofgreatresonance but cloudy meaning, words fullofheat and enthusiasm. Fancytitles forsimple thingsarehelpful,asarethe useofnumbers and thecreation ofnew words forvague concepts. Allofthese create theimpression ofspecialized knowl edge, giving youaveneer ofprofunclity. Bythe same token, trytomake the subjectofyourcult new andfresh, sothat fewwillunderstand it.Done right, thecombination ofvague promises, cloudy‘ butalluring concepts,andfiery enthusiasm will stirpeople’ssouls and agroupwillform around you. Talk :00vaguelyand youhave nocredibility. But itismore dangerous tobespecific. Ifyouexplainindetail thebenefits people willgain byfol- lowing your cult, youwill beexpectedtosatisfythem. As acorollarytoitsvagueness your appealshould also besimple. Most peop1e’s problemshave complexcauses: deep-rooted neurosis, inter connected social factors, roots thatgowayback intime and areexceed- inglyhard tounravel. Few, however, have thepatiencetodeal with this; most peoplewant tohear that asimplesolution will cure their problems. Theabilitytooffer thiskind ofsolution willgive yougreat power andbuild youafollowing. Instead ofthecomplicated explanationsofreallife, return totheprimitive solutions ofourancestors, togood oldcountry remedies, to mysterious panaceas. Step2:Emphasize theVisual and the Sensual over theIntellectual. Once peoplehave begun togatheraroundyou,twodangers willpresent themselves: boredom andskepticism. Boredom will make people goelse where; skepticism will allow them thedistance tothink rationally about whatever itisyouareoffering, blowing awaythemistyouhave artfullycre- ated andrevealing yourideas forwhat theyare.
