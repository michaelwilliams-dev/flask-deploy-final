the enemy, Wang Kuo being slain."] 1. The sight of men whispering together in small knots or speaking in sub- dued tones points to disaffection amongst the rank and file. 2. Too frequent rewards signify that the enemy is at the end of his resources; [Because, when an army is hard pressed, as Tu Mu says, there is always a fear of mutiny, and lavish rewards are given to keep the men in good temper.] too many punishments betray a condition of dire distress. [Because in such case discipline becomes relaxed, and unwonted severity is necessary to keep the men to their duty.] 1. To begin by bluster, but afterwards to take fright at the enemy�s numbers, shows a supreme lack of intelligence. [I follow the interpretation of Ts�ao Kung, also adopted by Li Ch�uan, Tu Mu, and Chang Yu. Another possible meaning set forth by Tu Yu, Chia Lin, Mei Tao-ch�en and Wang Hsi, is: "The general who is first tyran- nical towards his men, and then in terror lest they should mutiny, etc." This would connect the sentence with what went before about rewards and punishments.] 1. When envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths, it is a sign that the enemy wishes for a truce. [Tu Mu says: "If the enemy open friendly relations be sending hostages, it is a sign that they are anxious for an armistice, either because their strength is exhausted or for some other reason." But it hardly needs a Sun Tzu to draw such an obvious inference.] 1. If the enemy�s troops march up angrily and remain facing ours for a long time without either joining battle or taking themselves off again, the situ- ation is one that demands great vigilance and circumspection. [Ts�ao Kung says a maneuver of this sort may be only a ruse to gain time for an unexpected flank attack or the laying of an ambush.] CHAPTER 10. THE ARMY ON THE MARCH 84 1. If our troops are no more in number than the enemy, that is amply suffi- cient; it only means that no direct attack can be made. [Literally, "no martial advance." That is to say, CHENG tactics and frontal attacks must be eschewed, and stratagem resorted to instead.] What we can do is simply to concentrate all our available strength, keep a close watch on the enemy, and obtain reinforcements. [This is an obscure sentence, and none of the commentators succeed in squeezing very good sense out of it. I follow Li Ch�uan, who appears to of- fer the simplest explanation: "Only the side that gets more men will win." Fortunately we have Chang Yu to expound its meaning to us in language which is lucidity itself: "When the numbers are even, and no favorable opening presents itself, although we may not be strong enough to deliver a sustained attack, we can find additional recruits amongst our sutlers and camp-followers, and then, concentrating our forces and keeping a close watch on the enemy,
