"You speak," hesaid, "ofastatesmanlike Asclepius."^^ "Plainly," Isaid."And don'tyouseethat hissons,because hewas 408a likethat,bothshowed themselves tobegoodmen inthewar atTroy andmade useoftheartofmedicine intheway Isay?Ordon'tyou re- member that aswellfrom thewound Pandarus inflicted onMenelaus, They sucked outtheblood andsprinkled gentle drugs onit^^ [86] BooJi III/407a-409a socrates/glaucon andthat after thisthey didn't prescribe what hemust drink oreat 408a anymore thanwith Eurypylus, beUeving thedrugs tobesufficient tocuremenwho before theirwounds were healthy andorderly in theirregimen, even iftheyshould happen totake adrink mixed with b barley, cheese, andwine rightaway? And, asforthose with anaturally sickly and licentious body, they thought that living isofnoprofit either tothemselves orothers, that theartshouldn't beapplied to them, andthattheymustn't betreated— noteven iftheywere richer than Midas." "You speak," hesaid, "ofquite subtle sonsofAsclepius." "It'sappropriate," Isaid."And yet it'sinjust thisthatthetragic poets aswell asPindar^** don't obey us.Although they claim Ascle- piuswasthesonofApollo, they alsosayhewaspersuaded bygold to cure arichmanwhowasasgood asdeadand it'sforthisthathewas struck withathunderbolt. Butwe,inaccord withwhatwassaidbefore, c won't believe both things fromthem; rather ifhewasagod's son,we'll sayhewasn't basely greedy, and ifhewasbasely greedy, hewasn't a god's son." "Quite right inthat," hesaid. "Butwhatdoyousayabout this, Socrates? Won't weneed togetgood doctors inthecity?And, of course, thosewhohavehandled themost healthy menandthemost d sickoneswould bethebest,andthebestjudges, similarly, would be thosewhohavebeen familiar with allsorts ofnatures." "Yesindeed, Imeangood ones," Isaid."Butdoyouknowwhom I consider tobesuch?" "Iwould, ifyou'd tellme,"hesaid. "Well, I'lltry," Isaid."However youasked about dissimilar mat- ters inthesame speech." "How's that?" hesaid. "Doctors," Isaid,"would prove cleverest if,beginning inchild- hood, inaddition tolearning theart,theyshould befamiliar withvery many andverybadbodies andshould themselves suffer alldiseases and e notbequite healthy bynature. For Idon'tsuppose theycare forabody with abody— inthatcase itwouldn't bepossible forthebodies them- selves ever tobe,ortohavebeen,bad—butforabody with asoul;and it'snotpossible forasoul tohave been, andtobe,badandtocare for anything well." "Correct," hesaid. "Ajudge, ontheother hand,myfriend, rules asoulwith asoul, 409a and it'snotpossible for ittohavebeen reared andbeen familiar with badsoulsfromyouth on,andtohavegonethrough the listofallunjust deeds andtohavecommitted them itself soastobesharp atinferring from itself theunjust deeds ofothers likediseases inthebody. Rather, [87 ] socrates/glaucon therepublic 409a itmust havebeen inexperienced anduntainted bybad dispositions when itwasyoung, if,asafineandgood soul, it'sgoing tomake healthy judgments about what isjust. This isexactly whydecent men when they areyoung, look asthough theywere innocents^^ and easily hdeceived byunjust men, because theyhave inthemselves nopatterns of affections similar tothose ofbadmen." "Yes, indeed," hesaid, "this isthevery thing thathappens to them." "That, yousee, iswhy," Isaid, "thegoodjudge must notbeyoung butold, alatelearner ofwhat injustice is;hemust nothavebecome aware ofitaskindred, dwelling inhisown soul. Rather, having studied itassomething alien inalien souls, over along time, hehasbecome thoroughly aware ofhow itisnaturally bad, having made use of knowledge, nothisownpersonal experience." "Well," hesaid, "ajudge who's likethatseems tobemost noble." "And good, too," Isaid,"which iswhatyouasked. Themanwho hasagood soul isgood. That clever andsuspicious man, theonewho hashimself donemany unjust things andsupposes he's amaster crim- inalandwise, looks clever, because heisonhisguard, when hekeeps company with hislikes—taking hisbearings bythepatterns within himself. Butwhen hehascontact withgoodmenwho areolder, henow d looks stupid, distrustful outofseason, and ignorant ofahealthy disposition, because hedoes notpossess apattern forsuch aman. But since hemeets badmenmore often thangood ones, heseems tobe rather more wisethanunlearned, both tohimself andtoothers." "That is,"hesaid, "quite certainly true." "Then it'snotinsuch aman thatthegoodandwisejudge mustbe looked forbutintheformer," Isaid."Forbadness would never know virtue and itself, while virtue inaneducated nature will intime gain a eknowledge ofboth itself andbadness simultaneously.
