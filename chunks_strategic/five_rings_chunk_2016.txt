Socrates' demand thatthecitybeunified isidentical tothedemand thatthebody and itsextensions— property andthefamily— beperfectly mastered. Ifthatmastery isimpossible, soisthecity.Wewould learn from this factthatphilosophy isessentially aprivate activity andthatthecity mustalways beruledbyprejudices. Moreover, from theexample ofthe city inspeech, amanwould learnwhathemustovercome inhimself inorder tobecome aphilosopher. Socrates forgets thebody inorder to make clear itsimportance. Toputthematter more simply: only inacitysuch asSocrates and hiscompanions have constructed willnoobloquy beattached toSoc- rates' deplorable neglect ofhisfamily andhisindifference tothelabor necessary tomaking acomfortable living. This city,which isconstructed inresponse toAristophanes' charge thatSocrates hadtobreak thelaw inorder tofeedandclothe himself andinorder toreplenish hissociety ofmalecompanions, willtakecareofhim,andhischildren willbetal- ented youths ofthekindhesought outinAthens. Inallother cities Soc- ratesmustbemorally suspect asapoorhusband andfather. Socrates has thestrength toendure thisopprobrium; ifhewere seriously concerned about it,hewould fetter hismind intrying toavoid it.Inthepassage under consideration, then,weseetheconditions ofphilosophy andwhat mustbesacrificed toit.Asyetthecitizens ofthiscityhavenosufficient rea- sontomake these sacrifices. But ifphilosophy isdesirable, soarethese ef- forts toconquer everything thatattaches onetoparticularity. Socrates can contemplate going naked where others goclothed; heisnotafraid ofridi- cule.Hecanalsocontemplate sexual intercourse where others arestricken with terror; heisnotafraid ofmoral indignation. Inother words, hetreats thecomic seriously andthetragic lightly. Hecansmile where others cryandremain earnest where others laugh. IntheSymposium hesays [387 ] THEREPUBLIC thatthetruepoetmustbeboth tragedian andcomedian, implying that thetruepoet isthephilosopher. Hereheshows thatthemanwhohas both giftsmust usethem tooppose theways thevulgar tragic andcom- icpoets usethem; hemust treat thetragic lightly andthecomic seriously, hence reversing their usual roles.Themanwho isable todo this isalready aphilosopher. Inboth cases, itisshame which mustbe opposed; forshame isthewall builtbyconvention which stands be- tween themind andthelight.Theordinary poetry appeals tothat shame, accepting itsedicts aslaw,while philosophic poetry overcomes it.Shame, inboth thecase ofnakedness and that ofincest, is spiritedness' means ofcontrolling eros forthesakeofpreservation and thecity.The effect ofthatshame ispervasive andsubtle, making the thinkable appear unthinkable. Themind requires heroic efforts in order tobecome aware ofthedistortions ofitsvision caused byshame and toovercome them. Having discussed thecommunity ofwomen andchildren and its advantages, Socrates andGlaucon turntothequestion ofthepossibility ofthisregime. ButSocrates, whoseems anxious toavoid thisquestion, turns thediscussion totheforeign relations oftheircompleted city, particularly totheway inwhich itwillfight wars.Thechanges within thecitybring about changes inthecharacter ofinter-city relations. In this discussion, although Socrates provides some satisfactions tobe derived fromwarforGlaucon's erotic andwarlike temper, thegeneral intention istotemper andhumanize war.Tothisend, Socrates pro- poses apan-Hellenic policy ofhostility toward thebarbarians. Asthe relations among themembers ofthecityaretobeliketherelations among themembers ofafamily, sotherelations among theGreek cities aretobecome liketherelations which prevail among theparties ina cityandtherelations between Greeks andnon-Greeks aretobecome liketherelations ofGreek cities. Thus there isageneral reduction of hostility along theline(without expectation that itcanbedoneaway with altogether), andeventhebarbarians profit from thechange. Inthis way, allmen arebrought closer tooneanother byextending thesenti- ments connected with love ofone'sown toallofhumanity: fellow citizens aretobebrothers, Greeks aretobefellow citizens, andbar- barians aretobeGreeks. Atthispoint Socrates accepts theGreek, or conventional, distinction between Greek andbarbarian. Oneshould not,however, assume thatheislimited bythishorizon; heisspeaking toGlaucon who issubject tosuch limitations. Later,when Glaucon has learned more, Socrates asserts that thisgood citycanbeeither Greek or barbarian. This discussion oftherelation among cities mixes conven- tionwith nature intheintention ofbringing men closer together and removing theobstacles which prevent therecognition ofacommon hu- [388] Interpretive Essay manity, without atthesame timeundermining theprinciples which make political lifepossible. Theeager Glaucon finally insists thatSocrates must stoptrying to avoid thequestion. Socrates must tellwhether theregime ispossible. Glaucon, however, nolonger means bypossible whathadearlier been meant. Hewants toknowhow theregime willcome intobeing;
