him out of Sun Tzu�s mouth.] 13. These are the five besetting sins of a general, ruinous to the conduct of war. 14. When an army is overthrown and its leader slain, the cause will surely be found among these five dangerous faults. Let them be a subject of meditation. 1. Chapter 10 THE ARMY ON THE MARCH [The contents of this interesting chapter are better indicated in ss. 1 than by this head- ing.] 1. Sun Tzu said: We come now to the question of encamping the army, and observing signs of the enemy. Pass quickly over mountains, and keep in the neighborhood of valleys. [The idea is, not to linger among barren uplands, but to keep close to sup- plies of water and grass. Cf. Wu Tzu, ch. 3: "Abide not in natural ovens," i.e. "the openings of valleys." Chang Yu tells the following anecdote: Wu- tu Ch�iang was a robber captain in the time of the Later Han, and Ma Yuan was sent to exterminate his gang. Ch�iang having found a refuge in the hills, Ma Yuan made no attempt to force a battle, but seized all the fa- vorable positions commanding supplies of water and forage. Ch�iang was soon in such a desperate plight for want of provisions that he was forced to make a total surrender. He did not know the advantage of keeping in the neighborhood of valleys."] 2. Camp in high places, [Not on high hills, but on knolls or hillocks elevated above the surrounding country.] facing the sun. [Tu Mu takes this to mean "facing south," and Ch�en Hao "facing east." Cf. infra, SS. 11, 13. Do not climb heights in order to fight. So much for mountain warfare. 3. After crossing a river, you should get far away from it. ["In order to tempt the enemy to cross after you," according to Ts�ao Kung, and also, says Chang Yu, "in order not to be impeded in your evolutions." 75 CHAPTER 10. THE ARMY ON THE MARCH 76 The T�UNG TIEN reads, "If THE ENEMY crosses a river," etc. But in view of the next sentence, this is almost certainly an interpolation.] 4. When an invading force crosses a river in its onward march, do not advance to meet it in mid-stream. It will be best to let half the army get across, and then deliver your attack. [Li Ch�uan alludes to the great victory won by Han Hsin over Lung Chu at the Wei River. Turning to the CH�IEN HAN SHU, ch. 34, fol. 6 verso, we find the battle described as follows: "The two armies were drawn up on opposite sides of the river. In the night, Han Hsin ordered his men to take some ten thousand sacks filled with sand and construct a dam higher up. Then, leading half his army across, he attacked Lung Chu; but after a time, pretending to have failed in his attempt, he hastily withdrew to the other bank. Lung Chu was much elated
