however, hehelps ustoseethedistinction be- tween thetwo. Itisanewwayofstating thealready familiar tension between theneeds ofthebodyandthose ofthesoul.Thevirtues con- nected with thecityhelp topreserve thecityandthereby itsinhabi- tants; preservation, ormere life, isthegoal.Thevirtues connected with philosophy aidinthequest forthecomprehensive truth; thegood life is thegoal.Both goalsmake theirdemands, andthosedemands conflict. There are,then,twokinds ofvirtue: philosophic virtue anddemotic, or vulgar, virtue. Moreover, inboth instances, virtue isloved notforvirtue's sake butforsome other goodbeyond it;or,touseKantian language, the system ofthevirtues presented bySocrates isheteronomous. What Glaucon hadasked for isaproof that justice isgood initself.The implicit Socratic teaching isthat liosuchproof ispossible, thatnature doesnotgiveaground foravirtue notconnected withsome other end. Hediffers from theutilitarians only inthattheneeds ofthebody do notconstitute theonly end. InSocratic thought, thedemands of [396 ] Interpretive Essay philosophy, orofthesoul,provide asecond polar starfortheguidance ofhuman conduct. Thistempers theunmitigated pursuit ofthegoods connected withthebodyandthecitywhich characterizes thetradition begun byMachiavelli andHobbes; and itadds asublimity totheac- count ofthevirtues which isalsolacking inthelaterthought. Still, this leaves thevirtues ofthewarrior class inakind oflimbo. They are asked toliveanddieforthecity.They areasked tohavemore virtues than their self-preservation would demand, yetthey arenot philosophers. What, then, isthestatus oftheir virtues? Socrates seems todeny theexistence oftheindependent moral virtues. These arethe virtues presented byAristotle asends inthemselves, pursued only be- cause they arenoble. Socrates presents instead twokinds ofvirtues, one lowandonehigh, butbothmercenary inthesense thatthey arepur- sued forthesakeofsome reward. The warrior's virtue issomewhere between them. Virtue, ifpursued forother reasons, isnolonger what wemeanbytrue virtue; thegreat tradition stretching from Aristotle to Kant isevidence forthat.Butvirtue pursued foritsownsake iswithout ground andhasatincture offolly. This istheSocratic teaching. Moral virtue isahalfway house, partaking ofthegrandeur etmisere ofits twosources. (487b-503b) Adeimantus, sensing theinadequacy ofthisproof of thephilosopher's public virtue andcomparing itwith theexperience of thecities, forthefourth and lasttime stops Socrates inthename ofthe city.Once more, hisinterruption takes theform ofanaccusation, but anaccusation nolonger directed against certain political proposals but rather against thephilosophers themselves, against thetruesource of the difficulties. According toAdeimantus, philosophers mislead men bytheir superior power ofspeech, making theweaker argument appear thestronger; atbestthey areuseless tothecity, atworst, andmost usually, they arecompletely vicious. Ofallmen, their dedication tothe cityappears tobemost questionable. Philosophy always hasabad reputation, and itbecomes Socrates' duty toshow that itsill-repute is thefault ofthosewhohate itrather thanofitspractitioners. Intheper- fonnance ofthatduty,hewillalsoprove toGlaucon thatphilosophy is onething thatamanwould want topursue even ifitbrings himabad reputation orthereputation forinjustice. Ifphilosophy isthehealth of thesoul,andhence justice inthehighest sense, justice isdesirable init- self, regardless ofreputation. This isthepraise ofjustice Glaucon asked forinthebeginning. Theexplanation ofphilosophy's plight isdivided intothree parts: thetruephilosophers aremisunderstood andneglected, thepotential [397 ] THEREPUBLIC philosophers arecorrupted, andimpostors have taken ontheguise of philosophers. Philosophy isexculpated and isuseful tothecity ifprop- erlyused.Theappeal isdirected tothepeople asawhole, whom Adeimantus seems torepresent. Thepeople's hostility isexplained asa result ofmisunderstanding andthedeceptions ofvicious men.Thepeo- plearerepresented aspersuadable because they aredecent, andthere arenoreal conflicts ofinterest. This gentleness ofthepeople isa necessary condition oftheactualization ofthegood cityand is therefore somewhat overstated inanaccount which tries toshow thata citywillaccept philosophers askings. Socrates begins hisapology withanimage, the firstofseveral that aretocome. These images constitute akind ofSocratic poetry and serve tocounterbalance thepowerful attack Socrates hasmade on poetry. Just aswelearned thatthepoetsknow thehuman passions, herewelearn thatthey areinpossession ofoneofthemost powerful tools forleading men tothetruth.The intellect doesnotperceive the ideas directly; itknows oftheir existence onlythrough particulars. Man must reason about thethings heperceives inorder toknow their causes. Without afullandprofound experience ofthephenomena, the intellect
