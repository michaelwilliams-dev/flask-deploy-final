"Let ussay it,then, asfollows," Isaid, "the justmandoes notget thebetter ofwhat islikebutofwhat isunhke, while theunjust man getsthebetter oflikeandunlike?" d "what yousaid isverygood, "hesaid. "And," Isaid, "istheunjust manbothprudent andgood, while thejustman isneither?" "That's good too,"hesaid. "Then," Isaid, "istheunjust man also liketheprudent andthe good, while thejustman isnotlikethem?" [27] THBASYMACHUS/SOCKATES THEREPUBLIC 349d "How"hesaid, "could henotbeHkesuchmen, since heissuch asthey, while theother isnotlikethem." "Fine. Then iseach ofthem such asthose towhom heislike?" "What elsecould theybe?"hesaid, e "All right, Thrasymachus. Doyousaythatoneman ismusical andthatanother isunmusical?" "Ido." "Which isprudent andwhich thoughtless?" "Surely themusical man isprudent andtheunmusical man thoughtless." "Then, inthethings inwhich heisprudent, ishealsogood, andin those inwhich heisthoughtless, bad?" "Yes." 350a "Andwhat about amedical man? Isitnotthesame withhim?" "Itisthesame." "Then, youbestofmen, isanymusical manwho istuning alyre inyour opinion willing togetthebetter ofanother musical man in tightening and relaxing the strings, ordoesheclaim hedeserves more?" "Not inmyopinion." "But thebetter oftheunmusical man?" "Necessarily," hesaid. "Andwhat about amedical man?Onquestions offoodanddrink, would hewant togetthebetter ofamedical man oramedical ac- tion?" "Surely not." "But thebetter ofwhat isnotmedical?" Yes. "Now, forevery kind ofknowledge andlackofknowledge, seeif inyouropinion anyman atallwhoknows chooses voluntarily tosayor domore thananother manwhoknows, andnotthesame astheman who islikehimself inthesame action." b "Perhaps," hesaid, "itisnecessarily so." "Andwhat about theignorant man?Would henotgetthebetter ofboth themanwhoknows andthemanwhodoes not?" "Perhaps." "Themanwhoknows iswise?" "Isayso." "And thewiseman isgood?" Isayso. "Then themanwho isbothgoodandwise willnotwant togetthe better ofthelike,butoftheunlike andopposite?" [28] Boo/c I/349d-351a thrasymachus "Itseems so,"hesaid. 350b "Butthebadandunlearned willwant togetthebetter ofboth the likeandtheopposite?" "Itlooks like it." "Then, Thrasymachus," Isaid,"does ourunjustman getthebet- terofboth likeandunlike? Weren't yousaying that?" "Iwas,"hesaid. "And thejustman willnotgetthebetter oflikebutofunlike?" c "Yes." "Then," Isaid, "the justman islikethewiseandgood, butthe unjustman likethebadandunlearned." "I'm afraid so." "Butwewere alsoagreed thateach issuch astheonehe is like." "Wewere." "Then thejustmanhasrevealed himself tousasgoodandwise, andtheunjustmanunlearned andbad." Now,Thrasymachus didnotagree toallofthissoeasily asItell it now,buthedragged hisfeetandresisted, andheproduced awonderful c quantity ofsweat, for itwassummer. Andthen Isawwhat Ihadnot yetseenbefore—^Thrasymachus blushing. Atallevents, whenwehad come tocomplete agreement about justice being virtue andwisdom, andinjustice both viceandlackoflearning, Isaid, "All right, letthat besettled forus;butwedidsaythat injustice ismighty aswell.Or don'tyouremember, Thrasymachus?" "Iremember," hesaid."Butevenwhat you're saying now doesn't satisfy me,and Ihavesomething tosayabout it.But ifIshould speak, Iknow well thatyouwould saythat Iammaking apublic harangue. So e then, either letmesayasmuch asIwant; or,ifyouwant tokeepon questioning, goahead andquestion, and, justaswitholdwiveswho tell tales, Ishall saytoyou, 'All right,' and Ishallnodandshakemy head." "Not, inanycase, contrary toyourown opinion," Isaid. "To satisfy you," hesaid, "since youwon't letmespeak. What elsedoyouwant?" "Nothing, byZeus," Isaid, "but ifthat's whatyouaregoing to do,goahead anddo it.And I'llaskquestions." "Then ask." "Iaskwhat Iasked amoment agosothatwecan inanorderly fashion make athorough consideration oftheargument about the 351, character ofjustice ascompared toinjustice. Surely itwassaidthat in- justice ismore powerful andmightier than justice. Butnow," Isaid.

But,Thrasy- machus, Idonotdesire ittobesosimply considered, but inthis h way:would yousaythat acity isunjust that tries toenslave other cities unjustly, andhasreduced them toslavery, andkeeps many enslaved toitself?" "Ofcourse," hesaid."And it'sthisthebest citywillmost do,the onethat ismost perfectly unjust." "Iunderstand," Isaid, "that thisargument wasyours, but Iam considering thisaspect ofit:willthecitythatbecomes stronger than another have thispower without justice, orisitnecessary for ittohave thispower with justice?" c "If,"hesaid, "it's asyou
