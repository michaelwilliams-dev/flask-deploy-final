cause each of us isn't self-sufficient but is in need of much. Do you believe there's another beginning to the founding of a city?" "None at all," he said. b. "So, then, when one man takes on another_ for one need and another for another need, and, since many things are needed, many men gather in one settlement as partners and helpers, to this common settlement we give the name city, don't we?" "Most certainly." "Now, does one man give a share to another, if he does give a share, or take a share, in the belief that it's better for himself?" "Certainly." "Come, now," I said, "let's make a city in speech from the begin? ning. Our need, as it seems, will make it." "Of course." b. "Well, now, the first and greatest of needs is the provision of food for existing and living." "Certainly." "Second, of course, is housing, and third, clothing, and such." "That's so." "Now wait," I said. "How will the city be sufficient to provide for this much? Won't one man be a farmer, another the housebuilder, and still another, a weaver? Or shall we add to it a shoemaker or some other man who cares for what has to do with the body?" "Certainly." "The city of utmost necessity26 would be made of four or five men." b. "It looks like it." "Now, what about this? Must each one of them put his work at the disposition of all in common-for example, must the farmer, one man, provide food for four and spend four times as much time and labor in the provision of food and then give it in common to the others; or must he neglect them and produce a fourth part of the food in a 370 a fourth part of the time and use the other three parts for the provision of a house, clothing, 27 and shoes, not taking the trouble to share in com? mon with others, but minding his own business for himself?" And Adeimantus said, "Perhaps, Socrates, the latter is easier than the former." "It wouldn't be strange, by Zeus," I said. "I myself also had the thought when you spoke that, in th first place, each of us is naturally not quite like anyone else, but rather differs in his nature; different b men are apt for the accomplishment of different jobs. Isn't that your opinion?" "It is." "And, what about this? Who would doï¿½a finer job, one man prac? ticing many arts, or one man one art?" "One man, one art," he said. "And, further, it's also plain, I suppose, that if a man lets the cru? cial moment in any work pass, it is completely ruined." "Yes, it is plain." "I don't suppose the thing done is willing to await the leisure of the man who does it; but it's necessary for the man who does it to follow close upon the thing done, and not as a spare-time occupation." "It is necessary."
