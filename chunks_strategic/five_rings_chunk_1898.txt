"And what about this?Won't lawsuits andcomplaints against one another virtually vanish fromamong them thanks totheir possessing nothing private butthebody, while therest isincommon? Onthis basis they willthenbefreefrom faction, totheextent atanyrate that ehuman beings divide into factions over thepossession ofmoney, chil- dren, andrelatives?" "Yes," hesaid, "it'squite necessary thattheyberidoffactions." "And further, there would justly benosuits forassault orinsult among them. Forwe'll surely saythat itisfineandjust formen totake careoftheirowndefense against others ofthesame age,thusimposing onthem thenecessity oftaking careoftheir bodies." "Right," hesaid. 465a "This law isalso right," Isaid, "inthat, ifaman's spiritedness is aroused against someone, hewould presumably satisfy itinthisway andbelesslikely togetintobigger quarrels." "Most certainly." "Further, anolderman willbecharged with ruling andpun- ishing alltheyounger ones." "Plainly." "And, further, unless rulers command it, it'snot likely that a younger man willeverattempt toassault orstrike anolder one.Andhe won't, Isuppose, dishonor one inanyother way.Forthere aretwo sufficient guardians hindering him, fearandshame: shame preventing hhimfrom laying hands asonparents, fearthattheothers willcome tothe aidofthemanwho suffers it,some assons, others asbrothers, and others asfathers." "So itturns out,"hesaid. "Then willthemen, asaresult ofthelaws, live inpeace withone another inallrespects?" [144 ] BookV/464c-466b socrates/glaucon "Verymuch so." 465b "Since they arefreefrom faction among themselves, there won't everbeanydanger thattherestofthecity will split into factions against these guardians oroneanother." "Surely not." "Because oftheir unseemliness, Ihesitate tomention thepettiest oftheevilsofwhich theywould berid:poormen flattering rich, allthe c wantandgrieftheyhave inrearing children andmaking money forthe necessary support ofthehousehold, making debts andrepudiating them, doing allsorts ofthings toprovide fortheallowances thatthey turnover tothewomen andthedomestics tomanage. What andhow they suffer from these things,myfriend, isperfectly plain, ignoble, and notworth mentioning." "Yes, itisplain," hesaid,"even toablind man." d "Sothey'll beridofallthisandlivealifemore blessed than that most blessed onetheOlympic victors live." "Inwhatway?" "Surely theOlympic victors areconsidered happy forasmall part ofwhat belongs tothesemen. Their victory isnotonly fairer butthe public support ismore complete.^^ The victory theywin isthe preservation ofthewhole city,andthey arecrowned withsupport and everything elsenecessary tolife—boththeythemselves andtheir chil- dren aswell;andthey getprizes from their citywhile they liveand e when they diereceive aworthy burial." "That's very fine," hesaid. "Doyouremember," Isaid, "that previously anargument—I don'tknowwhose— reproached uswithnotmaking theguardians hap- py;they, forwhom it'spossible tohavewhat belongs tothecitizens, 466a havenothing? Wesaid, Ibelieve, that ifthisshould happen tocomeup atsome point,wewould consider itlater, butthatnowweweremaking theguardians guardians andthecityashappy aswecould, butwewere notlooking exclusively toonegroup initandforming itforhap- piness." "Iremember," hesaid. "Well, then, ifthe lifeofourauxiliaries nowappears farfinerand better than thatoftheOlympic victors, isthere anyriskthat itwillin somewayappear comparable tothatoftheshoemakers oranyother h craftsmen ortothatofthefarmers?" "Not inmyopinion," hesaid. "Moreover, itisjust tosayhere too, asIsaid there, that ifthe guardian attempts tobecome happy insuchawaythatheisnolonger a guardian, andsuch amoderate, steady, and (asweassert) best life won't satisfy him; but, ifafoolish adolescent opinion about happiness [145] socbates/glaucon theREPUBLJq; 466c getsholdofhim, itwilldrivehimtoappropriate everything inthecity with hispower, and he'lllearn thatHesiod wasreally wisewhen hesaid thatsomehow 'thehalf ismore than thewhole.'"^^ "Ifhefollows myadvice," hesaid, "he'll stay inthis life."
