onthe human mind: alossofproportion,anobsession with detail combined with aninability toseethelarger picture,akind ofextravagant uglinessthat no longercommunicates. Clearly,isolation isasdeadlyforthecreative arts as forthesocial arts. Shakespeare isthe most famous writer inhistorybe- cause, asadramatist forthepopular stage, heopened himselfuptothe masses, makinghiswork accessible topeoplenomatter what their educa- tion and taste. Artists who hole themselvesupintheir fortress lose asense ofproportion,their work communicating onlytotheir small circle. Such artremains cornered andpowerless. Finally,sincepowerisahuman creation, itisinevitably increased by Contact with other people. Instead offallinginto thefortress mentality, view theworld inthefollowingmanner: Itislike avast Versailles, with everyroom communicatingwith another. You need tobepermeable, able tofloat inand outofdifferent circles and mix with different types.That kind ofmobilityand social contact willprotect youfrom plotters,who will beunable tokeepsecrets fromyou,and fromyour enemies, who will be unable toisolateyoufromyourallies. Alwaysonthe move, youmix and mingleinthe rooms ofthepalace,never sittingorsettlinginoneplace.No hunter canfixhisaim onsuch asvvifbmovingcreature. LAW 18 135 I36 LAW 18Image:The Fortress. High uponthehill, thecitadel be comes asymbol ofallthat is hateful inpowerandauthority. The citizens ofthe town betray youtothefirstenemythat comes. Cutofffrom communication and in- telligence,thecitadel falls with ease. Authority: Agoodand wiseptince,desirous ofmaintainingthat character, and toavoid givingtheopportunitytohis sons tobe- come oppressive,will never build fortresses, sothatthey may place their reliance upon thegood will oftheir subjects,and not uponthestrengthofcitadels. {Niccolo Machiavelli, 1469-4527) REVE RSAL Itishardlyever right andpropitioustochoose isolation. Without keeping anear onwhat ishappeninginthestreets, youwill beunable toprotect yourself. About theonly thingthat constant human contact cannot facili~ tate isthought.Theweight ofsociety's pressure toconform, and thelack of distance from other people,can make itimpossibletothink clearlyabout what isgoingonaround you. As atemporary recourse, then, isolation can help youtogain perspective. Manyaserious thinker hasbeen producedin prisons,where wehave nothingtodobutthink. Machiavelli could write The Prince onlyonce hefound himself inexile and isolated on afarm far from thepolitical intrigues ofFlorence. Thedanger is,however, that thiskind ofisolation will sireallkinds of strangeandpervertedideas. Youmay gain perspectiveonthelarger pic- ture, butyou lose asense ofyourown smallness and limitations. Also, the more isolatedyou are, theharder itistobreak outofyourisolation when you choose to——it sinksyoudeepinto itsquicksand without your noticing. Ifyou need time tothink, then, choose isolation onlyasalastresort, and onlyinsmall doses. Becareful tokeep your way back intosociety open.
