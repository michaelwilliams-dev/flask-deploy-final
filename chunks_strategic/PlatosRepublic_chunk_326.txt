secondary interest insofar as it ( 36o ] serves that goal. He, therefore, must have sufficient reasons for his sacrifices; and to him Socrates reveals the positive purpose of the war? riors' education. The warriors are to be lovers of the beautiful, par? ticularly of beautiful souls. The products of the fine arts are to be used to surround them with imitations of the beautiful things; those imita? tions will give the warriors the habit of seeing beauty in the deeds, characters, and speeches of virtuous men and hence teach them to love the virtue whose various aspects they see represented.ï¿½Imitation must not flatter the passions, but transform and sublimate them. The severe moderation of the bodily desires whkh Socrates has imposed is the condition of the liberation of the love of the fair and the virtuous. The needs of the body, if dominant, lead to ugliness, no matter how it is adorned; for their satisfaction requires discord and vice. The warriors, prepared by restraint of their desires and habituated to the vision of no? ble men, will shun Thrasymachus' thieves and tyrants, not as a result of moral principle but as a matter of taste. The warriors will be more politically reliable because the eros of the beautiful, a grace and delicacy of sentiment and action, will temper their pursuit of their self? interest. Glaucon now sees that eros, properly educated, has a place in the new order and thus accepts the efforts requisite to that new order. In attempting to grasp what Socrates is trying to achieve here, it is again most helpful to turn to Shakespeare's poetry. The wise Prospero, who must rule unwise men in his little island city of the Tempest, uses three kinds of motivations to insure their political good conduct. The slavish Caliban can be motivated only by pinches and blows. The cov? etous Alfonso and his cohorts are, like Cephalus, restrained by the equivalents of conscience and the fear of divine punishment. But Prospero's favorites, to whom he intends to hand over his rule, are lovers of the beautiful who need no harsher constraints. Ferdinand and Miranda are each struck with wonder at the aspect of the other's beauty. Each longs to be worthy of the other and is eager to perform the deeds which will win approval. This is a gentler, surer, and more human path to virtue. ( 403c-412b) After music, which would seem to be the training of the warriors' souls, Socrates turns to gymnastic which would seem to be the training of the warriors' bodies. One might have expected that this would be the most important part of the education since these men are being trained for combat; they are artisans of victory in battle and they must learn their art at least as well as any of the other artisans. However, Socrates treats the subject as though the men did not have bodies and as though the use of arms was not the cause of victory. He
