daya guest, Dainagon Tsunehiro. asked ifhecouldcarrythe teabowl into the light,toexamine itmore closely. The bowl rarelyleftthetable, butthe em- perorwas ingood spiritsand heconsented. AsDainagori carried thebowl totherailingoftheverandah, however, and held ituptothelight,it slippedfrom hishands and fell on arock inthegarden below, smashing intotinyfragments. The emperor ofcourse was furious. “It was indeed most clumsy ofme toletitdrop inthisway,” said Dainagon,with adeep how, “but really there isnotmuch harm done. This ldo tea~bowl isavery old one anditis impossibletosayhow much longer itwould have lasted, butanyhow itis not athing ofanypublic use, soIthink itrather fortunate that ithasbroken thus.” Thissurprising responsehad animmediate effect: Theemperor calmed down. Dainagonneither sniveled noroverapologized, butsignaled hisown worth andpower bytreating hismistake with atouch ofdisdain. The emperor had torespondwith asimilar aristocratic indifference; his angerhad made him seem low andpetty——an image Dainagonwas able to manipulate. Among equalsthis tactic might bacldire: Your indifference could make youseem callous. Butwith amaster, ifyouactquicklyand without great fuss, itcan work togreateffect: Youbypass hisangry response,save him thetime andenergyhewould waste bybroodingover it,andallow him the opportunitytodisplayhis own lack ofpettiness publicly. Ifwemake excuses and denials when we arecaughtinamistake ora deception,westirthewaters and make thesituation worse. Itisofien wiser toplay thingstheopposite way. The Renaissance writer Pietro Aretino often boasted ofhisaristocratic lineage,which was, ofcourse, afiction, since hewasactuallythe sonofashoemaker. When anenemyofhisfinally revealed theembarrassing truth, word quiddy spread,and soon allof Venice (where helived atthetime)was aghast atAretino’s lies. Had he tried todefend himself, hewould have only draggedhimself down. His re- sponsewas masterful: Heannounced that hewas indeed the sonofashoe- maker, but thisonly provedhisgreatness,since hehad risen from the lowest stratum ofsocietytoitsvery pinnacle. From then onhenever men- tioned hisprevious lie,trumpeting instead his new positiononthematter ofhisancestry. Remember: Thepowerful responsestoniggling, petty annoyancesand irritations arecontemptand disdain. Never show thatsomethinghas af- fectedyou,orthat youareoffended——that onlyshowsyouhave acknowl- edgedaproblem. Contemptisadish that isbest served cold and without affectarion.
