mild forms ofattack, theyareactually potent weapons, andwill even~ tually erode afoundation ofpower. Anenemy who does notrespect you willgrow bold, and boldness makes even thesmallest animal dangerous. Thelate-eighteenth-ceninirycourt ofFrance, asexemplified byMarie- Antoinette, had become sohopelesslytied toarigid formalitythat the average Frenchman thoughtitasillyrelic. This depreciation of 21centuries- oldinstitution was thefirstsign ofaterminal disease, foritrepresenteda symbolic looseningofthepeople’slies tomonarchy.Asthesituation wors- ened, Marie-Antoinette andKing Louis XVIgrew onlymore rigid intheir adherence tothepast—and quickened their pathtotheguillotine. King Charles IofEngland reacted similarlytothetide ofdemocratic change brewing inEnglandinthe 1630s: Hedisbanded Parliament, and hiscourt rituals grew increasinglyformal and distant. Hewanted toreturn toan older style ofruling, with adherence toallkinds ofpetty protocol. His rigidity only heightenedthe desire forchange. Soon, ofcourse, he was swept upinadevastating civil war, andeventuallyhelost hishead tothe executioner’s axe. Asyougetolder, youmust relyeven less onthepastBevigilantlest theform your character hastaken makesyouseem arelic. Itisnot amatter ofmimicking the fashions ofyoutl1—thatisequally worthy oflaughter. Ratheryourmind must constantly adapttoeach circumstance, even thein- evitable changethat the time has come tomove over and letthose of younger age preparefortheirascendancy. Rigidity willonlymakeyou lookuncannilylike acadaver. Never forget, though,that fonnlessuess isastrategic pose. Itgives you room tocreate tactical surprises;asyourenemies struggletoguess your next move, they reveal their ownstrategy, puttingthem atadecided disad— vantage. Itkeeps theinitiative onyour side, putting yourenemies inthe positionofnever acting, constantly reacting. Itfoils their spying andintelli- gence. Remember: Formlessness isatool. Never confuse itwith ago~with- the~llow style,orwith areligious resignationtothetwists offortune. You useformlessness, notbecause itcreates inner harmonyandpeace,but be- cause itwill increase your power. Finally, learningtoadapttoeach new circumstance means seeing events through yourowneyes, and often ignoringtheadvice thatpeople constantly peddle your way. Itmeans thatultimately youmust throw out thelaws that others preach,and thebooks they write totellyouwhat todo, and thesage advice oftheelder. “The laws thatgoverncircumstances are abolished bynew circumstances,” Napoleon wrote, which means that itis uptoyou togauge each new situation. Relytoo much onotherpeople’s ideas and you end uptakingaform notofyourown making.Too much re« spectforother people’swisdom will makeyoudepreciate yourown. Be brutal with thepast, especially your own, and have norespectforthe philosophiesthat arefoisted onyoufrom outside.

That ishow Mao succeeded against theNationalists: Hebroke their forces into small, isolated units, which hethen could easilyoverwhelm with astrong attack. The lawofcon— centration prevailed.
