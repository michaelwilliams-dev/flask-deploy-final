isavoid. Images arethefood ofthemind; andpoetry can make themost fruitful images. Inpoetry onecanfindrepresentations ofmanwhich arericher andmore typical thananyexperiences ofmen thatone islikely tohave. The poetic images should beused as geometers userepresentations ofcircles—tounderstand something of which theparticular circle isonlyanimperfect image. Poetry charac- teristically causesmen toforget that itsimages areonlyimages, that is, likethecircledrawn inthesandwhich isnotthecircle; but itneednot always beabused inthisway.Theimage Socrates presents toAdeiman- tushasadouble function: ittellshimalovely talewhich charms him intoamore favorable disposition toward philosophy; and itcauses him tothink about themeaning oftheimage. Adeimantus must seehowthe image applies tophilosophy asheknows it,and inwhat respects the image differs from thereality itindicates. Thusheisbeginning tothink about philosophy, and inawayheisphilosophizing. InSocrates' image, thecity iscompared toashipwhich belongs to thepeople, whoarecompared toabigandstrong shipowner who isal- sosomewhat deaf, short ofvision, andignorant ofnavigation. In- capable ofrunning theship himself, theowner turns itover tosailors who aremore preoccupied with securing thepositions ofpower than they arewith theartofsailing. They should besubordinate toapilot, butthemechanics ofthestruggle forpower become anartthat is treated asanendinitself.Thetrue pilot isnotinterested infighting for [398 ] Interpretive Essay hisproper position and isexcluded. Inthisimage, thesailors areakin to thewarrior classwithout rulers; thechiefs ofthat classremain preoc- cupied with thehuman world, unaware thatagood sailing requires knowledge ofmathematics andastronomy, that is,ofthecosmos asa whole. Thisknowledge appears irrelevant totheir concerns, andthe true pilot isridiculed. Thephilosopher, who, contrary totheindica- tions oftheApology, mustknow nature, andparticularly thenature of theheavens, isasnecessary tothecity asapilot istoaship.He is merely misunderstood, andthepeople aremisled. Hisknowledge isnot described here assomething desirable initself forhim, but itisac- quired forthesakeofthecity; itislikethepilot's orthedoctor's art. He isready and fittoserve ifonly theship's owner canperceive how necessary heis.Thephilosopher's situation might wellbecompared to thatofGulliver inLilliput. He istoobigandtoodifferent tobetrusted, toomuch beyond thetemptations ofthesmall ambitious men tobe their tool;but iftheLilliputians could havemaintained their faith in him,theywould have both profited andbecome more just.This ex- planation ofthephilosopher's lackofreputation also serves asade- fense against theaccusation thathepries intothesecrets oftheheavens andHades, notbydenying thathedoesbutbyinsisting onthevalue to thecityofhisdoing so. After having bymeans oftheimage disposed oftheobjection that thephilosopher isuseless tothecity, Socrates turns totheexplanation ofwhy gifted youngmenturnaway fromphilosophy. According toSoc- rates, their talents make them able tosucceed atanything; healthy young people usually trytoexcel atwhat ismost respectable within theircommunity. Thehonors given bythecity attract thepotential philosophers topolitical life.Because theseyoung menseem tohave great political futures, corrupt andambitious statesmen hope tomake useofthem, promising them allsorts ofadvantages iftheyarewilling toadopt thecurrent practices ofthecity. Itisnot,asisoften said, the sophists whocorrupt theyoung. The sophists, Socrates says, are-harm- lessmenwho areonly servants ofthecity's passions. The truesoph- ist,thetrueeducator, isthepublic assembly— thesovereign body of thepeople; itforms thetastes oftheyoung byitsthunderous expressions ofapproval anddisapproval. Itisalmost impossible foranoble youth toresist thecity's praise andblame andtheprospects itoffers him.The manwhoundertakes toteach thetruth tosuch ayouth facesmany difficulties. Theyouth himself isdisinclined torenounce thecharms which draw him.And, iftheteacher succeeds ininfluencing him, the unruly sailors willpersecute theteacher who isrobbing them ofagreat prop oftheirpower. First theteacher willbeintimidated bythreats; [399 ] THEREPUBLIC finally hewillbebrought totrialandcondemned todeath asacorrup- toroftheyouth. Allhewastrying todowasteach thetrue politics which would enable theyoungman todogood forthecitywhile punish- ing itsdeceivers. Such ateacher, tobesure, takes hispupil away from theimmediate andmost visible concerns ofthepeople, buthisin- tention istoprovide thepeople with thekind ofmentheywould pray tohave asrulers. Socrates claims thatmensuch ashimself donotcor- rupt theyouth buttrytosavethem from corruption. Bythusshowing thatthosewhocould begenuine philosophers abandon thepractice ofphilosophy, Socrates tries
