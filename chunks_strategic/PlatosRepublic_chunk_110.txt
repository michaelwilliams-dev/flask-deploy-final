three parts and with a dif? ferent one we act in each of the different ways? Do we learn with one, become spirited with another of the parts within us, and desire the pleasures of nourishment and generation and all their kin with a third; or do we act with the soul as a whole in each of them once we are started? This will be hard to determine in a way worthy of the argu? ment." "That's my opinion too," he said. 436 "Now let's try to determine whether these things are the same or :lifferent from each other in this way." "How?"� "It's plain that the same thing won't be willing at the same time to do or suffer opposites with respect to the same part and in relation to the same thing.25 So if we should ever find that happening in these things, we'll know they weren't the same but many." "All right." "Now consider what I say." "Say on," he said. "Is it possible that the same thing at the same time and with respect to the same part should stand still and move?" "Not at all." "Now let's have a still more precise agreement so that we won't have any grounds for dispute as we proceed. If someone were to say of a hu? man being standing still, but moving his hands and his head, that the same man at the same time stands still and moves, I don't suppose we'd claim that it should be said like that, but rather that one part� of him stands still and another moves. Isn't that so?" "Yes, it is." 'Then if the man who says this should become still more charm? ing and make the subtle point that tops as wholes stand still and move at the same time when the peg is fixed in the same place and they spin, or that anything else going around in a circle on the same spot does this too, we wouldn't accept it because it's not with respect to the same part of themselves that such things are at that time both at rest and in mo? tion. But we'd say that they have in them both a straight and a cir? cumference; and with respect to the straight they stand still since they don't lean in any direction-while with respect to the circumference they move in a circle; and when the straight inclines to the right, the left, forward, or backward at the same time that it's spinning, then in no way does it stand still." "And we'd be right," he said. "Then the saying of such things won't scare us, or any the more persuade us that something that is the same, at the same time, with respect to the same part and in relation to the same thing, could ever 437 1 )uffer, be, or do opposites." � "Not me at least,: he said. ;.: "All the same," I said, "so we won't be compelled to
