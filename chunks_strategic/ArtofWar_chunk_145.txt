can attack them as they relax. Master Sun Tire them by flight. CAO CAO Use swiftness to wear them out. WANG XI This means making a lot of surprise attacks. When they come out, you go home; when they go home, you go out. When they go to the aid of their left flank, you head to the right; when they go to the aid of their right flank, you go to the left. This way you can tire them out. ZHANG YU This way, your strength will remain intact, while they will be worn out. Master Sun Cause division among them.
