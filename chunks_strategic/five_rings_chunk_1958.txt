over three forms ofcouches." "Yes, three." c "Now, thegod,whether hedidn't want toorwhether some necessity was laiduponhimnottoproduce more thanonecouch in nature, made only one, thatveryonewhich isacouch. Andtwoor more such weren't naturally engendered bythegodnorwilltheybe begotten." "How's that?" hesaid. "Because," Isaid, "ifheshould make only two, again onewould come tolight theform ofwhich they inturnwould both possess, and that,andnotthetwo,would bethecouch that is." "Right," hesaid. d "Then, Isuppose, thegod,knowing thisandwanting tobeareal maker ofacouch that really isandnotacertain couchmaker ofacer- taincouch, begot itasonebynature." "So itseems." "Doyouwant ustoaddress him asitsnature-begetter orsome- thing ofthekind?" "That's just atanyrate," hesaid, "since bynature hehasmade both thisandeverything else." "Andwhatabout thecarpenter? Isn'theacraftsman ofacouch?" "Yes." "And isthepainter alsoacraftsman andmaker ofsuch athing?" "Not atall." "Butwhat ofacouch willyousayheis?" e "Inmyopinion," hesaid,"hewould most sensibly beaddressed as animitator ofthatofwhich these others arecraftsmen.' "All right," Isaid,"doyou, then, calltheman atthethird genera- tionfrom nature animitator?" "Most certainly," hesaid. "Therefore this will alsoapply tothemaker oftragedy, ifhe is animitator; he isnaturally third from aking andthe truth, as are alltheother imitators." "Probably." "Then wehave agreed about the imitator. Now tellme this 598aabout thepainter. Inyour opinion, doesheineach caseattempt to imitate thething itself innature, ortheworks ofthecraftsmen?" "Theworks ofthecraftsmen, "hesaid. "Such asthey areorsuch asthey look? Foryou stillhave tomake thisfurther distinction." "How doyoumean?" hesaid. [280] BookXI597b-599c sockates/glaucon "Like this.Does acouch, ifyouobserve itfrom theside, or 598a from thefront, orfromanywhere else, differ atallfrom itself? Or does itnotdiffer atallbutonly look different, andsimilarly with the rest?" "The latter isso,"hesaid. "Itlooks different, but isn't." "Now consider thisvery point.Toward which ispainting directed b ineachcase— toward imitation ofthebeing asitisortoward itslooking asitlooks? Isitimitation oflooks oroftruth?" "Oflooks," hesaid. "Therefore, imitation issurely farfrom the truth; and, as it seems, itisdue tothisthat itproduces everything— because itlays hold ofacertain small partofeach thing, andthatpart isitself only a phantom. Forexample, thepainter, wesay, willpaint forusashoe- maker, acarpenter, andtheother craftsmen, although hedoesn't understand theartsofanyoneofthem. But, nevertheless, ifheisa c good painter, bypainting acarpenter anddisplaying himfrom far off,hewould deceive children andfoolish human beings intothink- ingthat itistruly acarpenter." "Ofcourse." "But, inany event, Isuppose, myfriend, that this iswhat must beunderstood about allsuch things: when anyone reports to usabout someone, saying thathehasencountered ahuman being whoknows allthecrafts andeverything elsethat singlemen several- lyknow, andthere isnothing thathedoes notknow more precisely thananyone else, itwould have tobereplied tosuch aonethathe d isaninnocent human being and that, asitseems, hehasencountered some wizard andimitator andbeen deceived. Because hehimself is unable toputknowledge andlackofknowledge andimitation tothe test, thatmanseemed all-wise tohim." "Very true," hesaid. "Then, next," Isaid, "tragedy and itsleader, Homer, must be considered, sincewehearfromsome that thesemenknow allarts e and allthings human thathave todowith virtue and vice,andthe divine things too.For itisnecessary thatthegood poet, ifheisgo- ingtomake fairpoems about thethings hispoetry concerns, bein possession ofknowledge when hemakes hispoems ornotbeable tomake them. Hence, wemust consider whether thosewho tellus thishave encountered these imitators andbeen deceived; and whether, therefore, seeing their works, theydonotrecognize that these works arethird fromwhat isandareeasy tomake fortheman 599a who doesn't know thetruth— forsuch amanmakes what look like beings butarenot.Or,again, isthere alsosomething towhat they [281 ] socrates/gi^ucon therepublic 599a say,anddothegood poets really know about thethings that, inthe opinion ofthemany, they saywell?" "Most certainly," hesaid, "thatmustbetested." "Doyousuppose that ifamanwere able tomake both, thething tobeimitated andthephantom, hewould
