animportant role inthedialogue. 11.Cephalus wasnotanAthenian citizen butametic, that is,analien who isallowed tosettle inAthens andwhopays taxes butenjoys nocivil rights. Hewas originally from Syracuse. 12.Theexpression means thattheman isabout topass intotheother world; heisatthatstage ofoldagewhen hecanbesaidtostand onthethresh- oldofHades (cf. Iliad, XXII, 60,XXIV, 487; Odyssey, XV, 246). Inthe Iliad, itoccurs both times inthemouth ofthewretched Priam. 13."Like tolike" (cfPhaednis, 240c). 14.TheGreek word isanthropos, thegeneric word foramember ofthe human species. Theword foramalehuman being isarier.This isanimportant distinction inGreek andallows forconsiderable subtlety intheuseofthe terms.Onthe first level, anthropos isclearly thelower term; itsignifies the mere participation intheminimal qualities ofthespecies, whereas ananer is distinctly arealman,onewhohasdeveloped hismalehumanity andcanpar- ticipate inthehighest functions ofaman, politics, andwar.But,onasecond level, the fullorfinalendofhumanity may transcend mere maleness and include activities different from, andcontrary to,those oftherealman [cf. Callicles' attack onthephilosophers from thepoint ofview ofmanliness [441 ] THEREPUBLIC {GoTgias, 484c ff.)!- I"thissense, anthropos would bethedeeper andmore meaningful term. InBookVSocrates suggests thatthebestregime, and implicitly thebesthuman being, isacombination ofmaleandfemale. Unfor- tunately noterm inEnglish adequately translates arier; andtheword"man" cannot bereserved for itsince"man" must oftenbeadded where itdoes not exist inGreek (forexample, "thegoodman" isinGreek merely "thegood"). Anthropos willregularly betranslated as"human being." 15.This isAristophanes' description ofSophocles inFro^,s, 82. 16."Themany" isatranslation ofhoipolloi andimplies allthatthe lat- tertermmeans tous.Itisfrequently translated by"themass," "themob," and other such terms which areappropriate intheextent towhich they indicate theclass towhich Plato refers. ForPlato, however, thefactofnumber—the simple factthat this class contains themajority ofmen—isofdecisive impor- tance. The greatnumber ofmensharecommon traits, and,when theydom- inate, they necessarily lend acertain character totheregime. Politically the expression isused incontrast totheoneandthefew.Ultimately itreflects the theoretical problem of"theoneandthemany." Every time itisused, itis meant tocallupacluster ofmeanings. Here thetemptation totranslate itby"most people" mustberesisted, for such atranslation would obscure thefactthatSocrates isreferring toaclass of men, apolitically relevant class. This passage presents oneelement inthe definition ofthat classwhich issoimportant forpolitical life. Itisdominated byopinions which givetoomuch weight tomoney. Themany have adistorted sense oftheimportance oftheequipment necessary foragood life;they iden- tifythecondition ofhappiness withhappiness itself. Socrates finally calls the lowest class, aswell asthedesiring partofthesoul, themoney-making part (441a). This isoneofthemost massive political facts, and, inPlato's wayof teaching, itbecomes clear onlythrough fidelity tohisclear language. 17.TheGreek word ismythos; firstmeaning nornore than "aspeech" (asinHomer), itcomes tomean "astory," very often oneconnected with religious traditions. Thepoets arethemakers oftheim/thoi; themeaning and reliability ofmijthoi isanimportant question inPlato.Theterm willalways be translated thus. 18.This isthe first "timeoneofthewords inthefamily ofdikaiosyne, "justice," isused inthedialogue. Itarises, asitwere, accidentally during a discussion ofother questions. Justice gradually becomes theproblem ofthe dialogue, totheexclusion ofother questions; hence thetraditional subtitle of thebook.OntheJust.Dikaiosyne isjustice, thevirtue; dikaion iswhat isjust orright, thething oracttowhich thevirtue isrelated. 19.Inconversation, where wewould say"good," or"right," or"true," theGreeks said"you speak well," etc.This hasbeen reiidered as"what you say isgood," etc.Characteristically there arefourpossible alternatives used in thisformula, meaning true, correct, good, and fine, fair,ornoble {kalon). The onlyones thatpresent aproblem arethelasttwo.They have inthepastbeen translated andunderstood asthough theywere equivalent, butthere isa [442 ] Notes /Book I nuance ofdifference which should bepreserved. Something thathasbeen said canbegood without being fineornoble, justasfineornoble speedi isnot necessarily good ortrue.Ouridiom does notreveal thisdifference, but it does notfollow therefore thatthedistinction isnotrelevant toSocratic thought. Thekalon isacrucial andambiguous term inclassical moral thought altogether, andwehavenoprecise equivalent for it.Itmeans, inthe&st place, fairorbeautiful, andexpresses nobUity when qualifying speech ordeed.
