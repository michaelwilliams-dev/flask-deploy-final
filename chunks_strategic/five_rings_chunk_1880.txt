"the affections ofmenwhoaresick inthiswayare exactly likethat." "What about this?" Isaid. "Isn't itcharming inthem thatthey believe the greatest enemy of all isthemanwho tells the [103 ] SCXaiATES/ADEIMANTUS THEREPUBLTp 426a truth— namely, that untilonegivesupdrinking, stuffing oneself, sex b andidleness, there willbenohelp foroneindrugs, burning, orcutting, norincharms, pendants, oranything ofthesort." "Not quite charming," hesaid."Being harsh with themanwho sayssomething good isn'tcharming." "You arenot," Isaid, "as itseems, apraiser ofsuchmen." "No, indeed, byZeus." "Therefore, if,aswewere justsaying, thecityasawhole behaves like that,youwon't praise iteither. Orisn't ityourimpression thatthe verysame thing thesemendoisdonebyallcities withbadregimes, c which warn thecitizens theymust notdisturb thecity's constitution as awhole, under painofdeath forthemanwhodoes; while themanwho serves themmost agreeably, with theregime asitis,and gratifies them byflattering them andknowing their wishes beforehand andbeing clever atfulfilling them, willonthataccount bethegoodmanandthe onewise inimportant things andbehonored bythem?" "They certainly do,"hesaid,"seem tometoactinthesame way, and Idon't praise them inanyrespect whatsoever." d "Andwhat about themenwho arewilling andeager toserve such cities? Don't youadmire their courage and facility?" "Ido,"hesaid, "except forthosewho aredeceived bythem and suppose theyaretrulystatesmen because they arepraised bythemany." "How doyoumean?" Isaid. "Don't yousympathize with these men?Ordoyousuppose it'spossible foramanwho doesn't knowhow e totakemeasurements nottobelieve itwhenmany othermen likehim sayhe'sasix-footer?" "No," hesaid, "that Idon't suppose." "Then don'tbeharsh. Forsuchmen aresurely themostcharming ofall,setting down laws liketheoneswedescribed amoment agoand correcting them, always thinking they'll findsome limit towrongdoing incontracts andtheother things Iwasjusttalking about, ignorant that they arereally cutting offtheheads ofaHydra." 427a "Well," hesaid, "they donothing butthat." "I,forone," Isaid, "therefore thought that thetime lawgiver wouldn't have tobother with that class ofthings^** inthelawsandthe regime, either inacitywith abadregime orinonewith agood regime—intheonecasebecause it'suseless andaccomplishes nothing; intheother, partly because anyone atallcould findsome ofthese things, andpartly because therestfollow ofthemselves from theprac- tices already established." b "Then what," hesaid,"might stillremain forourlegislation?" [104 ] ^ookIV/426a'428a socrates/adeimantus/glaucon And Isaid,"For us,nothing. However fortheApollo atDel- 427b phi** there remain thegreatest, fairest, and firstofthelawswhich are given." "What aretheyabout?" hesaid. "Foundings oftemples, sacrifices, andwhatever elsebelongs to thecareofgods, demons, andheroes; andfurther, burial ofthedead and alltheservices needed tokeep those inthatother place gracious. Forsuch things astheseweneither know ourselves, norinfounding a cityshallwebepersuaded byanyotherman, ifweareintelligent, nor c shallwemake useofanyinterpreter other thantheancestral one.Now thisgod isdoubtless theancestral interpreter ofsuch things forallhu- mans, andhesitsinthemiddle oftheearth atitsnavel anddelivers his interpretations." "What yousay isfine,"hesaid."And that's whatmustbedone." "So then, sonofAriston," Isaid, "your citywould nowbe founded. Inthenext place, getyourself anadequate lightsomewhere; d andlookyourself— and callinyour brother andPolemarchus andthe others— whether wecansomehow seewhere thejustice might beand where theinjustice, inwhat they differ fromoneanother, andwhich themanwho's going tobehappy must possess, whether itescapes the notice ofallgodsandhumans ornot." "You're talking nonsense," said Glaucon. "You promised you would look for itbecause it'snotholy foryounottobring help to e justice ineveryway inyourpower." "What youremind meofistrue," Isaid,"andthough Imustdo so,youtoohave tojoin in." "We'll doso,"hesaid. "Now, then," Isaid, "Ihope I'llfind itinthisway. Isuppose our city— if,that is,ithasbeen correctly founded— isperfectly good." "Necessarily," hesaid. "Plainly, then, it'swise, courageous, moderate and just." "Plainly." "Isn't itthecase thatwhichever ofthemwehappen tofind will leave astheremainder what hasn't been found?" "Ofcourse." 428a "Therefore, justaswithanyother four things, ifwewere seeking anyoneofthem insomething orother andrecognized itfirst, that would beenough forus;but ifwerecognized theother three first, this would also suffice fortherecognition ofthething looked for.For plainly itcouldn't beanything butwhat's leftover." "What yousay iscorrect," hesaid. [105 ]
