of gain, and which of the officials are open to corruption."] 1. It is owing to his information, again, that we can cause the doomed spy to carry false tidings to the enemy. [Chang Yu says, "because the converted spy knows how the enemy can best be deceived."] 1. Lastly, it is by his information that the surviving spy can be used on ap- pointed occasions. 2. The end and aim of spying in all its five varieties is knowledge of the enemy; and this knowledge can only be derived, in the first instance, from the converted spy. [As explained in ss. 22-24. He not only brings information himself, but makes it possible to use the other kinds of spy to advantage.] Hence it is essential that the converted spy be treated with the utmost lib- erality. 1. Of old, the rise of the Yin dynasty [Sun Tzu means the Shang dynasty, founded in 1766 B.C. Its name was changed to Yin by P�an Keng in 1401. was due to I Chih [Better known as I Yin, the famous general and statesman who took part in Ch�eng T�ang�s campaign against Chieh Kuei.] who had served under the Hsia.

Popularly known as T�ai Kung, a title be- stowed on him by Wen Wang, he is said to have composed a treatise on war, erroneously identified with the LIU T�AO.] who had served under the Yin. CHAPTER 14. THE USE OF SPIES 129 [There is less precision in the Chinese than I have thought it well to in- troduce into my translation, and the commentaries on the passage are by no means explicit. But, having regard to the context, we can hardly doubt that Sun Tzu is holding up I Chih and Lu Ya as illustrious examples of the converted spy, or something closely analogous. His suggestion is, that the Hsia and Yin dynasties were upset owing to the intimate knowledge of their weaknesses and shortcoming which these former ministers were able to impart to the other side. Mei Yao-ch�en appears to resent any such aspersion on these historic names: "I Yin and Lu Ya," he says, "were not rebels against the Government. Hsia could not employ the former, hence Yin employed him. Yin could not employ the latter, hence Hou employed him. Their great achievements were all for the good of the people." Ho Shih is also indignant: "How should two divinely inspired men such as I and Lu have acted as common spies? Sun Tzu�s mention of them simply means that the proper use of the five classes of spies is a matter which requires men of the highest mental caliber like I and Lu, whose wisdom and capacity qualified them for the task. The above words only emphasize this point." Ho Shih believes then that the two heroes are
