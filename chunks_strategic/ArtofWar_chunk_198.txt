DU MU Whenever you are going to attack and fight, first you have to know the talents of the people employed by the opponent, so you can deal with them according to their abilities. Master Sun You must seek out enemy agents who have come to spy on you, bribe them and induce them to stay with you, so you can use them as reverse spies.

By intelligence thus obtained, you can get living spies to work as planned. ZHANG YU By means of these reverse spies, you find out greedy locals and vulnerable officials who can be induced to work for you.

By means of these reverse spies you can find out the conditions of the enemy, so that living spies can go and return as planned. Master Sun It is essential for a leader to know about the five kinds of espionage, and this knowledge depends on reverse spies, so reverse spies must be treated well.
