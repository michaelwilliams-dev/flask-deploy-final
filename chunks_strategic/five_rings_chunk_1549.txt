The astrologersoon arrived, but before giving thesignal,Louis de- cided toaskhim one lastquestion:“You claim tounderstand astrologyand toknow thefate ofothers, sotell mewhatyourfatewill beand howlong youhave tolive.” “Ishall diejustthree days before Your Majesty,"theastrologer replied.

Togetridofyou might spell disaster, even death, and yourmaster dares nottemptfateby findingout. There aremany waystoobtain such aposition.Foremost among them istopossessatalent and creative skill thatsimplycannot be replaced. DuringtheRenaissance, themajorobstacle toapajnteflssuccess was findingtheright patron. Michelangelo didthisbetter thananyone else: His patronwasPope juliusH.Butheand thepope quarreledover thebuilding ofthepope’smarble ‘comb, andMichelangeloleftRome indisgust Tothe amazement ofthose inthepope’s circle, notonlydidthepopenotfirehim, hesoughthim outand inhis own haughty way begged theartist tostay. Michelangelo,heknew, could find another patron,buthecould never find another Michelangelo. You donothave tohave thetalent of3.Michelangelo; you dohave to have askill that setsyouapart from thecrowd. You should create asitua- tion inwhichyoucanalways latch ontoanother master orpatron butyour master cannot easilyfind another servant with your particulartalent.

One dayHarry Colin, president ofColumbia Pictures, was visited in hisoffice byagloomy group ofhisexecutives. Itwas 1951, when thewitch- hunc againstCommunists inHollywood,carried onbytheUS. Congress’s House Un-American Activities Committee, was atitsheight. The execu- tives hadbad news: One oftheir employees,thescreenwriterjolm Howard Lawson, had been singled out asaCommunist. Theyhad togetridofhim night awayorsuffer thewrath ofthecommittee. HarryCohn was nobleeding—heart liberal; infact, hehadalwaysbeen adiehard Republican. Hisfavorite politicianwas Benito Mussolini, whom hehad once vis- ited, and whose framed photo hungonhiswall. Ifthere was someone he hated Cohn would callhim a“Communist bastard.” But totheexecutives’ amazement Cohn told them hewould notfireLawson. Hedidnotkeepthe screenwriter onbecause he was agoodWriter—there weremany good writers inHollywood.Hekepthim because ofachain ofdependence: Lawson wasHumphrey Bogart’swriter andBogartwas Columbia’s star.If Cohn messed with Lawson hewould ruin animmensely profitablerela- tionship.That was worth more than theterrible publicity brought tohim byhisdefiance ofthecommittee.
