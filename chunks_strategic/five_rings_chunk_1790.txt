Iftheir customs arenotdisrupted, people willlive onquietly. This was thecase forBurgundy, Brittany, Gascony andNormandy, which stayed along time with France. There is some variety oflanguage butthecustoms aresimilar. They are easy tointegrate. Whoever acquires them needs only torespect twothings: one, thatthebloodline ofthedynasty isended; two, nottoalter thelaws orfiscal system. That waythenew province becomes quickly apartoftheoldone. When oneacquires aprovince with another language, differ- entcustoms, anddifferent laws, then thetrouble begins. Ittakes realgood luck andmuch work tohold onto such aprovince. One way todosoisforthePrince who acquires such aholding togo andlivethere. This secures andpreserves thenew possession — astheTurks didwhen they took Greece intotheByzantine Em- pire, bymoving toConstantinople. Despite observing ahost of laws tohold onto thatState, itwould nothave been possible had theSultan notgone tolivethere. Being there, onesees disorders arise andcantake quick measures against them. Notbeing there they gettoobigtoremedy. Itmakes iteasier tooforprovincial officials. They have fastandeasy access tothePrince. Ifthey are good, they willlove himmore; ifthey arebad, they willfearhim themore. External enemies willrespect thePrincipality themore because, with thePrince there, thePrincipality willbemore diffi- culttolose. The other good solution istosend colonists inoneortwo places andletthem bepartofthenew state —otherwise onehas toplace troops there. Colonists don't cost much; onecansend them andkeep them there without expense. Theonly people itof- fends arethose whose fields andhouses areconfiscated, andthey THE PRINCE —35 areonly asmall partoftheestate. Those who arehurtbythis, be- inghomeless andpoor, arenotlikely tomake much trouble. The restofthepopulace isunharmed, andshould remain quiet, orbe- come afraid tomake trouble lestthey become victims ofthe spoils liketheothers. Therefore, colonies costless, remain loyal, andmake lesstrouble. The victims can't make trouble because they arepoor anddispossessed. Note thatyouhave tobeeither softorharsh, because men takeoffense easily atsmall insults, but they can't react against harsh measures. When youoffend some one, besure they areincapable ofrevenge. Byplacing troops there, thecostismuch more andmuch more goes intothesurveil- lance ofalltherenegade elements ofthestate sothatitsacquisi- tion becomes alosing proposition. Troops offend many more people what with housing andrequisition, which harms every- body. Everybody becomes theenemy andthey candoharm be- cause, though conquered, they remain athome. Occupation is therefore unproductive while colonization isuseful. Whoever isinsuch aprovince hastomake themselves Prince anddefender ofnearby dependent territories andseetoweaken- ingtheleaders ofthem andguard against anystrong foreigner en- tering them. Someone likethiswillalways bepromoted bythe discontents because ofambition orfear—aswesawwhen the Aetolians sentRoman troops toGreece andinevery other prov- ince they entered. Itisafactoflifethatassoon asapowerful foreigner enters aprovince allthose who areweaker flock tohis side motivated byenvy ofthechief putover them. So,inregard tolesser lords, anew Prince hasnotrouble lining them upbe- cause theyallswear solidarity with thenewstate hehasacquired. Hejusthastobecareful they don't take toomuch power andau- thority. With hisown power andtheir favor hecaneasily setback those who areambitious andthereby hecanhold sway inall things intheprovince. Ifhedoes notgovern well though hewill soon losedominion inwhat hehasacquired —andwhile heisin power —hewillhave nothing buttrouble. The Romans, inprovinces they conquered, observed these rules well. They colonized, engaged theweaker leaders, without 36— Niccolò Machiavelli making them stronger, putdown thestronger ones, anddidnot allow powerful foreigners togain sway. Greece isanexample. The Romans supported theAcheans andtheAetolians andset back theMacedonians. They exiled Antiochus. They never letthe Acheans ortheAetolians expand their states. They never let Philip's entreaties persuade them toanyfriendship without put- tinghimdown. They didnotconcede toAntiochus' power orin- fluence.
