and energies of most men would be imposed on them. For Cephalus the just is identical to the law of the city, and the law is protected by the gods. The problem of justice is simply expressed in his view: if there are no gods, there is no reason to be just or to worry; if there are, we must simply obey their laws, for that is what they wish. But common sense tells us that laws are not al? ways conducive to the good of those they are intended to benefit. Cephalus, however, is content to forget this fact in his sacrifices, even though his actions may be harming others. His lighthearted piety can seem extreme selfishness. He leaves to his son the con? sideration of what is truly good for other men, for it would force him to make a distinction between the just and the legal. And he leaves to all thoughtful selfish men the consideration of what the profitable life would be if there are no punishments after death. The unity of things expressed in the identification of the just and the legal under the protection of the gods has been rent asunder by Socrates' simple objection to Cephalus' assertion that a man should pay his debts. Now the members of this group must try to find out what justice is and whether justice is good for the man who practices it. Although the definitions of justice proposed by Cephalus, Polemarchus, and Thrasymachus are all found wanting and must be abandoned, the discussions concerning them are not simply critical nor is their result only negative. From each something is learned which is of the essence of political life and which is reflected in the final definition and the regime that embodies it. From Cephalus we learn that for most men justice can mean only law-abidingness, and that rewards and punishments in this life and the next are necessary to insure obedience which does not seem to them desirable in itself. Cephalus' definition fails because it cannot account for those instances in which one is admittedly exempted from obeying THE REPUBLJcf .1 the law. He has no grasp of the intention or principle of law. He ï¿½ be1ieves in the sanctity of private property: injustice is taking what belongs to others; justice, respecting what belongs to them. Belonging is defined by the law. But insanity and the intention to injure are suffi_ cient grounds for taking away from a man what is thought to belong to him. Rationa1ity and good will, or to put it otherwise, capacity to usea thing well and attachment to the community and its laws, are ap? parently conditions of the respect of a man's right to ownership. The simple example of the insane man who demands the return of his weap? on, if generalized, leads far from the letter of the law, which men like Cephalus must respect. It becomes Polemarchus' responsibility to ex? plain what standard should be looked to when
