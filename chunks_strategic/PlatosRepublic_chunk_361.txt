is questionable whether the virtues of the philosopher are quite the same as those of the citizen. One has only to consider the case of the philosopher's love of truth, which Socrates assimilates to the warriors' truthfulness. It is obvious that a man can love the truth without telling it and can also regularly tell what he understands to be the truth without any love for or questing after the real truth. Similarly, the philosopher's courage and moderation are not the same as those of the simple citizen. The philosopher is courageous because his constant pre? occupation with the eternal makes him somewhat oblivious to life, and notbecause he is�obedient to the city's rules about what is fearful and what not. And he is moderate because he has an immoderate love of the truth, not because he restrains his desires. Most important of all Socrates indicates that the philosopher is just only by showing tha; there are certain kinds of things he is likely to abstain from. This is the same procedure Socrates adopted in Book IV when he tried to prove that a man with a healthy soul will be just, and he admitted there that this is only a crude test. Thus the philosopher is likely to be indifferent to money because it plays only a small role in helping him acquire what he cares for, but there is nothing here that indicates he has a disposition to render unto others what is due to them. Moreover, there is also noth? ing in his nature which would attach him to the city. Socrates hints at this by repeating a catalogue of the philosopher's virtues several times; the virtues listed change slightly in the course of these repetitions. The most significant change is that justice is finally omitted (cf. 487a and 494b). The silent lesson would seem to be that it is indeed possible to possess intellectual virtue without what later came to be called moral virtue. The problem appears to be something like the following. As pre? sented in the Republic, the virtues can be derived from two possible sources: the necessities of the city and the necessities of philosophy. The virtues stemming from these two sources have much in common, but they are far from identical. Nonetheless, Socrates, procedure is to identify the two and thus to assert that the philosopher is identical with the virtuous man in the civic sense. In the very act of making this ques? tionable identi�cation, however, he helps us to see the distinction be? tween the two. It is a new way of stating the already familiar tension between the needs of the body and those of the soul. The virtues con? nected with the city help to preserve the city and thereby its inhabi? tants; preservation, or mere life, is the goal. The virtues connected with philosophy aid in the quest for the comprehensive truth; the good life is the goal. Both goals make their demands, and those demands conflict.
