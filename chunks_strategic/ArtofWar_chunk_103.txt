THE USE OF SPIES 1. Sun Tzu said: Raising a host of a hundred thousand men and marching them great distances entails heavy loss on the people and a drain on the resources of the State. The daily expenditure will amount to a thousand ounces of silver. [Cf. II. ss. ss. 1, 13, 14.] There will be commotion at home and abroad, and men will drop down exhausted on the highways. [Cf. TAO TE CHING, ch. 30: "Where troops have been quartered, brambles and thorns spring up. Chang Yu has the note: "We may be reminded of the saying: �On serious ground, gather in plunder.� Why then should carriage and transportation cause exhaustion on the highways?�The answer is, that not victuals alone, but all sorts of munitions of war have to be conveyed to the army. Besides, the injunction to �forage on the enemy� only means that when an army is deeply engaged in hostile territory, scarcity of food must be provided against. Hence, without being solely dependent on the enemy for corn, we must forage in order that there may be an uninterrupted flow of supplies. Then, again, there are places like salt deserts where provisions being unobtainable, supplies from home cannot be dispensed with."] As many as seven hundred thousand families will be impeded in their labor. [Mei Yao-ch�en says: "Men will be lacking at the plough- tail." The al- lusion is to the system of dividing land into nine parts, each consisting of about 15 acres, the plot in the center being cultivated on behalf of the State by the tenants of the other eight. It was here also, so Tu Mu tells us, that their cottages were built and a well sunk, to be used by all in common. [See II. ss. 12, note.] In time of war, one of the families had to serve in the army, while the other seven contributed to its support. Thus, by a levy of 100,000 men (reckoning one able- bodied soldier to each family) the husbandry of 700,000 families would be affected.] 121 CHAPTER 14. THE USE OF SPIES 122 1. Hostile armies may face each other for years, striving for the victory which is decided in a single day. This being so, to remain in ignorance of the enemy�s condition simply because one grudges the outlay of a hundred ounces of silver in honors and emoluments, ["For spies" is of course the meaning, though it would spoil the effect of this curiously elaborate exordium if spies were actually mentioned at this point.] is the height of inhumanity. [Sun Tzu�s agreement is certainly ingenious. He begins by adverting to the frightful misery and vast expenditure of blood and treasure which war al- ways brings in its train. Now, unless you are kept informed of the enemy�s condition, and are ready to strike at the right moment, a war may drag on for years. The only way to get this information is to employ spies, and it is impossible to
