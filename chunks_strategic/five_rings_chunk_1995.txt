isreally different, and itsservices cannot bemeasured bymoney, formoney isastandard forevaluating thecon- tributions made toward thesatisfaction ofdesire orthepreservation of life. Spiritedness isbeyond theeconomic system. Thefounders of modern economic science, whowanted ittobeauniversal political science, could dosoonlybydenying theexistence ofspiritedness orun- derstanding itasmerely ameans toself-presei-vation. Onlymenwho pursue seF-preservation andthegratification ofbodily desire canbe counted ontoactaccording totheprinciples ofeconomic "rationality." Now there aretwoclasses inthecity,andthedistinction between them isapurely natural one:oneclass ismotivated bybodily desire, theotherbyspiritedness. Theformer canbecounted ontopursue what wewould calltheeconomic goals.The latter hasliberated itselffrom thesingle-minded concern formere life.Butthepurposes ofthisclass arenotasyetclear. Itseems that itisinthenature ofspiritedness tobe intheservice ofsomething, justasitisinthenature ofsoldiers tobein theservice ofsomething. Neither spiritedness northeclasswhich em- bodies itcanbeends inthemselves; theirpurposes come from outside ofthemselves. This classcould beunderstood asaservant ofthewage- earning class, butthiswould mean thatthesuperior exists forthesake oftheinferior. Tounderstand thedignity ofthiselement inthesoul andinthecityrequires thediscovery ofathirdandhighest classwhich spiritedness serves andtheendofwhich isasclear asthatofthewage- earning class. This necessity forathird class isimplied inthedescrip- tionofthewarriors asnoble dogswhoguard aflock. Sheep dogsrequire shepherds. Thewarrior classwould thenbethelinkbetween thehighest andlowest class, gaining itsmeaning from itsservice tothehigher. The parallel ofcityand soulwould apply inthiscase too.However that may be,thecityneeds defenders, and italsonowneeds rulers, for its feverish desires make living together impossible without control. Itisinevitable thatthespirited warriors willrule inthis city, for they arestrong. Inevery civil society, there isonegroup thathasthe [349 ] THEREPUBLIC greatest strength, and itcanandalways does setdown thelaws inthe tenms suitable toit.Whatever thecharacter ofthis class, thecity'sway oflifewillbedetennined by it.This iswhatThrasymachus meant when hesaidthatjustice istheadvantage ofthestronger. Themembers ofthisclassdonotnecessarily possess wisdom oranyother element of virtue. IfSocrates andhiscompanions wish toestablish agood regime without having tocompromise withmere power, itisthiscrucial class theymust control and train.Theyneed notpreoccupy themselves with thewage-earning class, for itwillbeunable toresist thecommands of thewarriors. Theinstrument forcontrolling thewarriors iseducation and, therefore, from thispoint forward education isthecentral theme oftheRepublic. The city'sway oflifedepends onthecharacter and hence theeducation oftherulers. Socrates andGlaucon have established thisclass ofspirited war- riors toprotect thecityfrom itsenemies, butthey quickly become aware ofitsproblematic character. What istoprevent thesemenwho aresosavage toforeigners frombeing savage with their fellow citizens? Although they aresupposed toguard theflock, they arelikely toex- ploit it.What intheir nature willpermit them tobegentle totheir charges? Gentleness andharshness seem very likecontrary charac- teristics, andgood guardians thusappear tobeimpossible. ButSoc- rates, onsecond thought, recognizes thattheanimals towhom they compared theguardians docombine gentleness andharshness: dogs are gentle tothose theyknow andharsh tothose theydonotknow. Soc- ratesmost surprisingly draws theconclusion thatthegood guardian is possible if,inaddition tobeing spirited, hisnature isphilosophic. Judging friends andenemies bythe criterion ofknowledge and ignorance is,hesays, thewayofphilosophy, andthusphilosophy isthe principle ofgentleness. Inabook famous fortheproposal that philosophers bekings, this isthe firstmention ofphilosophy or philosophers. Philosophy isinvoked inthecityonly forthepurpose of solving apolitical problem. This identification ofdog-like affection foracquaintances with philosophy is,ofcourse, notserious. Itonly serves toprepare theway forthetrueemergence ofphilosophy inBookVand toheighten the difference between philosopher and warrior. The philosophers are gentlemenbecause theypursue knowledge andnotgain; their object does not entail exploitation ofothers. The love ofknowledge isa motive necessary totherulers ofthiscity inorder totemper their love ofvictory andwealth. Butthephilosophers aretheopposites ofthe dogsinasmuch asthey arealways questing toknow thatofwhich they areignorant, whereas thedogsmust cutthemselves offfrom theun- known andarehostile toforeign charms. They love theirownandnot [350 ] Interpretive Essay thegood.And thismustbeso,forotherwise theywould notmake the necessary distinction between their flockandthosewhoarelikely toat- tack it.Thewarrior principle isdoing good
