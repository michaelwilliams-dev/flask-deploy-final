TheRepublic is,ofcourse, a permanent book, oneofthesmallnumber ofbooks thatengage theinterest andsympathy ofthoughtful persons wherever books areesteemed and read infreedom. Noother philosophic book sopowerfully expresses the human longing forjustice while satisfying the intellect's demands for clarity. Theproblems ofjustice aspresented byPlato arouse more interest, excitement, anddisagreement atsome points than atothers. When non- philosophers begin theiracquaintance withphilosophers, theyfrequently say,"This isnonsense." Butsometimes they say,"This isoutrageous nonsense," and atsuchmoments their passions really become involved with thephilosophers, frequently culminating inhatred orinlove. Right nowPlato isboth attractive andrepulsive totheyoung. This ismost obvious when they reach thesection oftheRepublic where Socrates legislates about music. Between thelate1940s andthe mid-1960s there wasalullinmusic's power over thesoul,between the declining magnetism ofhighromanticism andthesurge ofrock,andmusic wasnotmuch ofapractical ortheoretical problem forstudents. They took note ofthefactthatSocrates isforcensorship—ano-no, ofcourse—and went on,nottakingmuch account ofwhat inparticular isbeing censored. If forced tothink about it,theytended tobesurprised thatmusic above all vn Preface totheSecond Edition should bethetheme ofcensorship when whatseemed tothem tobethe hkely candidates were science, poHtics, and sex.Butnow thatmusical frenzy hasresumed itsnatural place, Socrates isseen tobeboth pertinent anddangerous. Discussion isrealandintense, fo^^ocrates understands the charms—erotic, military, political, andreligious—ofmusic, which hetakes tobethemost authentic primitive expressions ofthesoul's hopes and terrors./But, precisely because music iscentral tothesoulandthe musicians aresuch virtuosos atplucking itschords, Socrates argues that itis imperative tothink abouthowthedevelopment ofthepassions affects the whole oflifeandhowmusical pleasures may conflict with duties orother, lessimmediate pleasures ./This isintolerable, andmany students feelthat thewhole Socratic understanding issubversive oftheir establishment. AsI said, theRepublic isperennial; italways returns withthechange ofhuman seasons. Another theme, notunrelated tomusic, alsosuddenly became current inthelate1960s andremains central togeneral andprofessional discussion about politics: community, orroots. And again therepublic becomes peculiarly attractive andrepulsive because nobook describes community soprecisely andsocompletely orundertakes sorigorously toturn cold politics intofamily warmth. Intheperiod just afterWorld War II,no criticism ofwhat KarlPopper called "theopen society" wasbrooked. The open society wasunderstood tobesimply unproblematic, having solved thedifficulties presented byolder thinkers. Theprogress ofscience was understood tobestrictly paralleled bythat ofsociety; individualism seemed nothreat tohuman ties,andmass society nothreat tomeaningful participation. Thesoftening inthisnarrow liberal position canbeseen in thesubstitution incommon discourse ofthelesspositively charged term technology forscience, thepervasive doubt about whether themastery of nature isaverygood idea,andacommonly expressed sentiment oflostness andpowerlessness onthepartofindividual citizens. Inthedays ofthoughtless optimism, Platowasconsidered irrelevant andhiscriticism wasnotavailable towarn usofpossible dangers. Now itis recognized thathehad allthedoubts wehavetoday andthatthefounding myth ofhiscity treatsmenandwomen asliterally rooted initssoil. Everybody issure thatPlatoknew something about community, buthe makes today's comfortable communitarians uncomfortable byinsisting that somuch individuality mustbesacrificed tocommunity. Moreover, they rightly sense thatPlato partly parodies theclaims andthepretensions of community. Theuninvolved Socrates, distrustful ofneat solutions, does notappear tobeavery reliable allyofmovements. Plato, criticized inthe recent past
