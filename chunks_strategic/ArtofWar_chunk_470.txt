If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight, even though the ruler forbid it; if fighting will not result in victory, then you must not fight even at the ruler�s bidding. 3"Aids to Scouting," p. xii. CHAPTER 11. TERRAIN 91 [Cf. VIII. ss. 3 fin. Huang Shih-kung of the Ch�in dynasty, who is said to have been the patron of Chang Liang and to have written the SAN LUEH, has these words attributed to him: "The responsibility of setting an army in motion must devolve on the general alone; if advance and retreat are con- trolled from the Palace, brilliant results will hardly be achieved. Hence the god-like ruler and the enlightened monarch are content to play a humble part in furthering their country�s cause [lit., kneel down to push the chariot wheel]." This means that "in matters lying outside the zenana, the decision of the military commander must be absolute." Chang Yu also quote the saying: "Decrees from the Son of Heaven do not penetrate the walls of a camp."] 20. The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing disgrace, [It was Wellington, I think, who said that the hardest thing of all for a soldier is to retreat.] whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.

Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you into the deepest valleys; look upon them as your own beloved sons, and they will stand by you even unto death. [Cf. I. ss. 6.

One of his soldiers was suffering from an abscess, and Wu Ch�i himself sucked out the virus. The soldier�s mother, hearing this, began wailing and lamenting. Somebody asked her, saying: �Why do you cry? Your son is only a common soldier, and yet the commander-in-chief himself has sucked the poison from his sore.� The woman replied, �Many years ago, Lord Wu performed a similar service for my husband, who never left him afterwards, and finally met his death at the hands of the enemy. And now that he has done the same for my son, he too will fall fighting I know not where.�" Li Ch�uan mentions the Viscount of Ch�u, who invaded the small state of Hsiao during the winter. The Duke of Shen said to him:
