and press them; their armies will surely collapse. The rule is �Use the force of momentum to defeat them� (�Three Strategies�). In 265, the Martial Emperor of Jin founded the Jin dynasty, heralding the end of the era of the Three Kingdoms. Establishing himself by overthrowing the dynasty set up by Cao Cao in the northern kingdom of Wei, the Martial Emperor of Jin also had a secret plan to destroy the southern kingdom of Wu. Many of his courtiers, however, were opposed to the idea of attacking Wu. Only three of the Martial Emperor�s ministers were in favor of his plan to destroy Wu. One of them was ultimately appointed military director of the border region. When the new military director of the border region reached his command outpost, he had the soldiers� armor and equipment repaired, and polished up their martial skills. Finally he selected a special force of elite troops, who then launched a successful assault against the army of one of the leading generals of Wu. Now the military director petitioned the Jin emperor for permission to make a full-scale attack on the kingdom of Wu.

The minister said, �Your Majesty is highly intelligent and has great military acumen. Your nation is rich and your armies are strong. The king of Wu is decadent and vicious, killing off the worthy and able. If you attack him now, the matter can be settled without much effort.� The emperor then gave his permission to move against the kingdom of Wu.
