In Wu’s gradual butremarkable rise tothetop,she was never naive. She knew thatanyhesitation, anymomentary weakness, would spell herand. If,everytime shegotridofarival anew oneappeared,thesolution was simple:She had tocrush them allorbekilled herself.

If,inyour struggles with them, you stophalfwayoreven three quartersoftheway, outofmercyorhope ofreconciliation, youonly make them more determined, more embittered, andthey willsomeday take re- venge. They mayactfriendly forthetime being, butthis isonlybecause youhave defeated them. Theyhave nochoice buttobide their time. The solution: Have nomercy.

Mao Tse—tung,adevoted reader ofSun—tzu andofChinese history gexr erally, knew theimportance ofthis law. Ini934 theCommunist leader and some 75,000 poorly equippedsoldiers fled into thedesolate mountains of western China toescape ChiangK.ai—shek’s much larger army,inwhat has since been called theLong March. Chiangwas determined toeliminate everylastCommunist, andbya fewyears later Mao had less than 10,000 soldiers left.By1937, infact, when China was invaded byjapan, Chiangcalculated that theCommu- nists were nolongerathreat. Hechose togive upthechase and conceir trate ontheJapanese.Tenyearslater theCommunists had recovered enoughtorout Chia.ng’s army. Chiang hadforgotten theancient wisdom of crushingtheenemy; Mao had not.Chiangwaspursued until heand his en- tirearmyfled totheisland ofTaiwan. Nothingremains ofhisregimein mainland China tothisday. The wisdom behind “crushingtheenemy”isasancient astheBible: Itsfirstpractitioner mayhave been Moses, who learned itfrom God Him« self, when HepartedtheRed SeafortheJews,then letthewater {low back over thepursuing Egyptianssothat “not somuch asone ofthem re- mained.” When Moses returned from Mount Sinai with the Ten Corn- mandments and found hispeople worshippingtheGolden Calf, hehad every lastoffender slaughtered. Andjust before hedied, hetold hisfollow- ers,finally about toenter thePromised Land, that when they had defeated thetribes ofCanaan theyshould “utterly destroythem . . .make no covenant with them, and show nomercytothem.” Thegoal oftotal victoryisanaxiom ofmodern warfare, and was codi- fied assuch byCarl vonClausewitz, thepremier philosopherofwar. Ana» lyzing thecampaigns ofNapoleon,von Clausewitz wrote, “We doclaim that direct annihilation oftheenemy’sforces must always bethedominant consideration. ...Once amajor victoryisachieved there must benotalkof rest, ofbreathing space. . .butonly ofthepursuit, goingfortheenemy again, seizinghiscapital, attackinghis reserves and anythingelse that might give hiscountryaidand comfort.” The reason forthis isthat afier war some negotiationand thedivision ofterritory. Ifyouhave onlywon a partial victory, you willinevitablylose innegotiationwhatyouhave gained bywar. The solution issimple: Allowyourenemies nooptions.Annihilate them and their territoryisyourstocarve. Thegoal ofpoweristocontrol yourenemies completely,tomake them obey your will. You
