others, always volatile and unstable. They do know how to be Princes and not cannot become Princes. They do not know how because they are not men of great enterprise or virtue, and, as private figures, they do not know how to command. They are incapable because they have no loyal and friendly forces of their own. Besides, like all things born too suddenly in nature, they have no roots and branches, so at the first adversity they die. If those suddenly raised to power have no virtue besides what they have from for.tune, they fall. Only those with virtue know conserve how to what has been given them and can make up afterwards what oth.ers have from the start. I would like in talking about one or the other way of becom.ing a Prince, either by virtue or fortune, to allude to two examples from our times � Francesco Sforza and Cesare Borgia. Fran.cesco Sforza with the right means and great virtue became on his own Duke of Milan. What he won with great trouble he main.tained with ease. Cesare Borgia, on the other hand, called Duke Valentin by the populace, acquired his state of Romagna with his 52� Niccol� Machiavelli father's help, and lost it the same way. This notwithstanding that on his behalf everything that a prudent and virtuous man could do was done, all that arms or fortune could do, to put roots into the state. As I said, whosoever lacks the basics beforehand can with great virtue build them up afterwards, even though it costs the leader something and puts the building at risk. If you consider the Duke's progress, you will see he prepared the foundation for fu.ture power, which should be mentioned, because I know of no other new Prince who better exemplified the right course with his actions. That he failed was due not to his own fault but because of extraordinary bad luck. Alexander VI faced both imminent and future dangers in wanting to make the Duke his son great. First, he saw no way of giving him a realm except by passing a Church estate. Taking one from the Church would arouse the Duke of Milan and the Vene.tians. Faenza and Rimini were under the protectorate of the Vene.tians. Besides, the arms of Italy, especially those that could serve others, were in the hands of those who feared the Papacy. Be.sides, one could not trust them because they were accomplices of the Orsinis and Colomas. It was needful therefore to upset their states and cause disorder among them to insinuate oneself into their territories. This was easy because the Venetians, for reasons of their own, wanted to bring the French into Italy again. This was made easier by the dissolution of King Louis' marriage. So the King entered Italy with the support of the Venetians and the consent of Alexander. No sooner was he in Milan than the Pope approached him about Romagna � which was agreed on, for the
