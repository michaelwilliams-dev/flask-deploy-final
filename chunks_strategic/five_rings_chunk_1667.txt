In1487 hefinally manageda meeting with thequeen,andalthoughhecould notconvince her tofinance thevoyage,hecompletely charmed her, and became afrequent guest in thepalace. In1492 theSpanish finally expelledtheMoorish invaders who cen- turies earlier had seized parts ofthecountry.With thewartime burden on hertreasury lifted, Isabella feltshecould finally respond tothedemands of herexplorer friend, and shedecided topayforthree ships, equipment,the salaries ofthecrews, and amodest stipendforColumbus. More important, shehad a.contract drawnupthatgranted Columbus thetitles andrightson which hehad insisted. Theonlyone shedenied——and onlyinthecontract’s fineprint—was the 10percent ofallrevenues fromanylands discovered: anabsurd demand, since hewanted notime limit onit.(Had the clause been leftin,itwould eventually have made Columbus and hisheirs the wealthiest familyontheplanet.Columbus never read thefineprint.) Satisfied that hisdemands had been met, Columbus setsailthat same yearinsearch ofthepassagetoAsia. (Before helefthewas careful tohire thebestnavigatorhecould find tohelp him getthere.) The mission failed tofind such apassage, yetwhen Columbus petitioned thequeentofinance aneven more ambitiousvoyage thefollowing year, sheagreed. Bythen shehad come toseeColumbus asdestined forgreat things. Interpretation As anexplorer Columbus was mediocre atbest. Heknew less about the seathan didtheaveragesailor onhisships,could never determine thelati- tude andlongitudeofhisdiscoveries, mistook islands forvast continents, and treated his crewbadly.But inone area hewas agenius:Heknew how tosellhimself. How else toexplainhow the sonofacheese vendor,a.low- level seamerchant, managed toingratiatehimself with thehighest royal and aristocratic families? Columbus had anamazing powertocharm thenobility,and itall came from thewayhecarried himself. Heprojectedasense ofconfidence that wascompletely outofproportiontohis means. Nor was hisconfidence theaggressive, ugly selfipromotion ofanupsmrt—itwas aquietand calm selflassurance. Infactitwas the same confidence usually shown bythe no bilitythemselves. Thepowerfulintheo1d—style aristocracies felt noneed to proveorassert themselves; being noble, they knew they alwaysdeserved more, and asked forit.With Columbus, then, theyfelt aninstant aflinity, forhecarried himself justtheway theyclid——elevated above thecrowd, destined forgreatness.
