pens to be?" "That's so," he said. "Then that's why we assert that the three primary classes of hu? man beings are also three: wisdom-loving, victory-loving, gain-loving." "Entirely so." "Then, also of pleasures, are there three forms, one underlying each of these?" "Certainly." "Do you know," I said, "that if you were willing to ask three such men, each in tum, what is the sweetest of these lives, each would most b. laud his own? The money-maker will assert that, compared to gaining, the pleasure in being honored or in learning is worth nothing, unless he makes some money from them." "True," he said. "And what about the lover of honor?" I said. "Doesn't he believe the pleasure from money to be a vulgar thing and, on the other hand, the pleasure from learning-whatever learning doesn't bring honor-to be smoke and nonsense?" "That's so," he said.ï¿½ "As for the lover of wisdom," I said, "what do we suppose he will hold about the other pleasures as compared with that of knowing the truth as it is and always being in some such state of pleasure while ]earning? Won't he hold them to be far behind in pleasure? And won't he call them really necessary since he doesn't need all the others if necessity did not accompany them?" "That we must know well," he said. "Since, then," I said, "the pleasures of each form, and the life it? self, dispute with one another, not about living more nobly or shamefully or worse or better but about living more pleasantly and painlessly, how would we know which of them speaks most truly?" "I certainly can't say," he said. "Consider it in this way. By what must things that are going to be finely judged be judged? Isn't it by experience, prudence, and argu? ment? Or could anyone have better criteria than these?" "How could he?" he said. "Now, consider. Of the three men, which is most experienced in all the pleasures of which we were speaking? Does the lover of gain, be? cause he learns the truth itself as it is, seem to you to be more ex- perienced in the pleasure that comes from knowing than the lover of wisdom is in the pleasure that comes from gaining?" "There's a great difference," he said. "It's necessary for the latter to taste of the other pleasures starting in childhood. But for the lover of gain it's not necessary to taste, or to have experience of, how sweet is the pleasure of learning the natural characteristics of the things which are; rather even if he were eager to, it wouldn't be easy." "There's a great difference, then," I said, "between the lover of wisdom and the lover of gain in their experience of both the plea? sures." 581 d e 582a b "Great indeed." c "And what about the lover of wisdom's relation to the lover of honor? Is he less experienced in the pleasure that comes from being honored than the lover
