make them reveal things.The brilliance ofthe maneuver is thattheywillmistake your interest inthem forfriendship,sothat younot only learn, youmalce allies. Nevertheless, you should practicethis tactic with caution and care. If people begintosuspect youarewormingsecrets outofthem under the cover ofconversation, they willstrictlyavoid you. Emphasize friendly chatter, notvaluable information. Your search forgems ofinformation can- notbetooobvious, oryour probing questions willreveal more about your selfandyourintentions than about theinformationyouhopetofind. Atrick totryinspyingcomes from LaRochefoucauld, who wrote, “Sincerityisfound invery few men, and isoften thecleverest ofruses—— one issincere inorder todraw outtheconfidence and secrets oftheother.” Bypretendingtobareyourheart toanother person,inother words, you make them more likelytoreveal their own secrets. Give them afalse con‘ fession andthey willgive youareal one. Another trick was identified by thephilosopherArthur Schopenhauer,who suggested vehementlycontra- dicting people you’re inconversation with asawayofirritating them, stir— ring them upsothatthey lose some ofthecontrol over their words. Intheir emotional reaction they will reveal allkinds oftruths about themselves, truthsyoucanlater useagainstthem. Another method ofindirect spyingistotestpeople,tolaylittle traps that make them reveal things about themselves. Chosroes II,anotoriously clever seventlrcentury kingofthePersians, hadmany ways ofseeing throughhissubjects without raising suspicion. Ifhenoticed, forinstance, that two ofhiscouruers had become particularly friendly,hewould call oneofthem aside andsayhehad information that theother was atraitor, and would soon bekilled. Thekingwould tellthecourtier hetmsted him more than anyone, and that hemust keepthisinformation secret. Then he would watch the two mencarefully. Ifhesaw that thesecond courtier had notchangedinhisbehavior toward theking, hewould conclude that the first courtier hadkeptthesecret, and hewould quickly promotetheman, later takinghim aside toconfess, “Imeant tokillyourfriend because of certain information that had reached me,but, when Iinvestigatedthe mat- ter,Ifound itwas untrue.” If,ontheother hand, thesecond courtier started toavoid theking, acting aloof and tense, Chosroes would know that the se cret had been revealed. Hewould ban thesecond courtier from hiscourt, letting him know that thewhole business hadonlybeen atest, but that even thoughthe man had done nothing wrong,hecould nolongertrust him. The firstcourtier, however, had revealed asecret, and him Chosroes would banfrom hisentire kingdom. Itmayseem anodd form ofspyingthat reveals notempirical informa: tion but aperson’scharacter. Often, however, itisthebestway ofsolving problemsbefore theyarise. Bytempting peopleinto certain acts, youlearn about their loyalty, their honesty, and soon.And this kind ofknowledge isoften the most valuable ofall:Armed with it,youcanpredicttheir actions inthefuture.

One ofthemost potent weapons inthebattle forinformation, then, isgiving outfalse information. AsMn- ston Churchill said, “Truth issopreciousthat she should alwaysbe at» tended byabodyguardoflies.” You must surround yourself with such a bodyguard,sothatyourtruth cannot bepenetrated. Byplantingtheinfor- mation ofyour choice, you control thegame. In1944 theNazis’ rocket-bomb attacks onLondonsuddenlyescalated.
