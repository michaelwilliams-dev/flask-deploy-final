to attack Zhuge Liang, Zhuge took down his flags and put away his battle drums, opened the gates and swept the road. Yi suspected an ambush, so he withdrew his forces and fled. Master Sun Therefore when you induce others to construct a formation while you yourself are formless, then you are concentrated while the opponent is divided. ZHANG YU What is orthodox to you, make opponents see as unorthodox; what is unorthodox to you, make them see as orthodox. This is inducing others to construct a formation. To be able to use the unorthodox as orthodox and use the orthodox as unorthodox, changing in a whirl, making yourself unfathomable to opponents, is being formless. Once the opponent�s formation is seen, you then mass your troops against it. Since your form is not revealed, the opponent will surely divide up his forces for security. Master Sun When you are concentrated into one while the opponent is divided into ten, you are attacking at a concentration of ten to one, so you outnumber the opponent. ZHANG YU Seeing where the enemy is solid and where the enemy is insubstantial, you do not go to the trouble of elaborate preparations and therefore are concentrated into one garrison.

Therefore you can be unified while the enemy is divided. The power of those who are united is whole, while the power of those who are divided is reduced. By striking diminished power with whole power, it is possible always to win. Master Sun Your battleground is not to be known, for when it cannot be known, the enemy makes many guard outposts, and since multiple outposts are established, you only have to do battle with small squads. CAO CAO When your form is concealed, the enemy is in doubt, and so divides up his company to be on guard against you. This means that enemy groups are small and easy to hit. WANG XI Don�t let the enemy know where you will clash, for if they know they will mass their strength to resist you. Master Sun So when the front is prepared, the rear is lacking, and when the rear is prepared the front is
