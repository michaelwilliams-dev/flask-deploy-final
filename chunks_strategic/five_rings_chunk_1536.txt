him. His numerous enemies band together; tryingto maintain hispower,heexhausts himself goinginthis direction and that, andinevitablyhecollapses.The reason forthispatternisthat theaggres- sivepersonisrarely infullcontrol. Hecannot see more than acoupleof moves ahead, cannot seetheconsequences ofthisbold move orthat one. Because heisconstantly beingforced toreact tothe moves ofhis ever- growinghost ofenemies, and totheunforeseen consequences ofhis own rash actions, hisaggressive energyisturned againsthim. Intherealm ofpower, youmust askyourself,what isthepoint ofchas- inghere and there, tryingtosolve problemsand defeat myenemies, ifI never feel incontrol? WhyamIalways havingtoreact toevents instead of directingthem? The answer issimple:Your idea ofpoweriswrong. You have mistaken aggressive action foreffective action. And most often the most effective action istostayback, keep calm, andletothers befrustrated bythetrips youlayforthem, playingforlong-term powerrather than quick victory. Remember: The essence ofpoweristheabilitytokeeptheinitiative, togetothers toreact toyour moves, tokeep your opponentand those around youonthedefensive. Whenyoumake other peoplecome toyou, yousuddenlybecome the onecontrollingthesituation. And the one who hascontrol haspower.Two thingsmust happentoplace youinthisposi- tion: Youyourselfmust learn tomasteryour emotions, and never tobein- fluenced byanger; meanwhile, however, youmust playonpeople’snatural tendencytoreact angrilywhen pushedand baited. Inthelong run, the abilitytomake others come toyou isaweaponfarmore powerfulthanany toolofaggression. Studyhow Talleyrand,the master ofthe art,performedthis delicate trick. First, heovercame the urgetotrytoconvince hisfellow statesmen thatthey needed tobanish Napoleonfaraway.Itisonlynatural towant to persuade people bypleading your case, imposing your will with words. But thisoften turns against you.Few ofTalleyrand’s contemporariesbelieved Napoleonwas still athreat, sothatifhehadspentalotofenergy tryingto convince them, hewould onlyhave made himself look foolish. Instead, he held histongueand hisemotions incheck. Most importantofall,helaid Napoleonasweet and irresistible trap.Heknew theman’s weakness, his impetuosity,hisneed forglory and thelove ofthe masses, and heplayed allthis toperfection.When Napoleonwent forthebait, there was nodan- gerthat hemight succeed and turn thetables onTalleyrand,who better thananyoneknew France’s depletedstate. And even hadNapoleonbeen able toovercome these difficulties, thelikelihood ofhis success would have been greaterwere heable tochoose histime andplace ofaction. Bysetting theproper trap, Talleyrandtook thetime andplaceinto hisown hands. Allofushave onlysomuchenergy,and there isamoment when our energiesare attheirpeak.‘Whenyoumake theotherpersoncome toyou, hewears himself out,wastinghisenergyonthetrip.Intheyear 1905, Rus- siaancljapanwere atwar. TheJapanesehadonly recently beguntomod emize theirwarships,sothat the Russians had astronger navy, butby spreadingfalse information theJapanesemarshal TogoHeihachiro baited theRussians intoleavingtheir docks intheBaltic Sea,makingthem believe theycould wipe outtheJapanesefleet inone swift attack. The Russian fleet could notreachjapan bythequickest route——throughtheStrait ofGibral— tarand then the Suez Canal into theIndian Ocean"-because these were controlled bytheBritish, andjapanwas anallyofGreat Britain. They had togoaround theCape ofGood Hope,atthesouthern tipofAfrica, adding over more than sixthousand miles tothevoyage.Once thefleetpassedthe Cape,theJapanese spreadanother false story: Theywere sailing tolaunch acounterattack. SotheRussians made theentire journeytojapanonconr batalert. Bythetimethey arrived, their seamen were tense, exhausted, and overworked, while theJapanesehad been waitingattheir ease. Despite the LAW 8 65 66 LAW 8odds and their lack ofexperienceinmodem naval warfare, theJapanese crushed theRussians. One added benefit ofmakingtheopponentcome toyou,asthe_]a.pa— nese discovered with theRussians, isthat itforces him tooperateinyour territory. Beingonhostile ground will make him nervous and often hewill rush hisactions and make mistakes. Fornegotiationsormeetings, itisal- wayswise tolure others into your territory,ortheterritory ofyourchoice. You have your bearings, while theyseenothing familiar and aresubtly placedonthedefensive.
