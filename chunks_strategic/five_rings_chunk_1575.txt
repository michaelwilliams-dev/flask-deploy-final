interaction and circulation. Tomake yourself powerful youmust place yourselfatthe center ofthings,asLouis XIV did atVersailles. Allactivity should revolve around you,andyoushould beaware ofeverything hap- peningonthestreet, and ofanyone who might behatching plots against you.Thedangerformost peoplecomes when theyfeel threatened. Insuch times theytend toretreat and close ranks, tofind securityinakind of fortress. Indoing so,however, theycome torely forinformation on a smaller and smaller circle, and lose perspectiveonevents around them. Theylosemaneuverabilityand becomeeasy targets, and their isolation makes them paranoid.Asinwarfare and most games ofstrategy,isolation often precedes defeat and death. Inmoments ofuncertaintyanddanger, you need tofight thisdesire to turn inward. Instead, make yourselfmore accessible, seek outoldallies and make new ones, force yourselfinto more and more different circles. This hasbeen thetrick ofpowerful peopleforcenturies. The Roman statesman Cicero was born into thelower nobility, and had little chance ofpowerunless hemanagedtomake aplace forhimself amongthe aristocrats who controlled thecity.Hesucceeded brilliantly, identifying everyonewith influence andfiguringouthow theywere con- nected toone another. Hemingled everywhere, knew everyone,and had such avast network ofconnections that anenemyhere could easilybe counterbalanced byanallythere, The French statesman Talleyrand playedthegamethe same way.Al- thoughhecame from one oftheoldest aristocratic families inFrance, he made apoint ofalways stayingintouch with what washappeninginthe streets ofParis, allowinghim toforesee trends and troubles. He even gota certainpleasureoutofminglingwithshadycriminal types,who supplied him with valuable information. Everytime there was acrisis, atransition of power--theend oftheDirectory,thefallofNapoleon,theabdication of Louis XVIII-~he was able tosurvive and even thrive, because henever closed himselfupinasmall circle butalways forged connections with the new order. This lawpertainstokings andqueens,and tothose ofthehighest power:The moment you lose contact withyour people, seeking securityin isolation, rebellion isbrewing.Neverimagine yourselfsoelevated thatyou can afford tocutyourself offfrom even thelowest echelons. Byretreating toafortress, youmake yourselfaneasy target foryour plotting subjects, who view yourisolation asaninsult and areason forrebellion. Since humans aresuch social creatures, itfollows that thesocial arts that make uspleasanttobearound can bepracticed only byconstant ex- posure and circulation. The moreyouareincontact with others, the more graceful and ateaseyoubecome. Isolation, ontheother hand, engenders anawkwardness inyour gestures,and leads tofurther isolation, aspeople startavoidmg you. In1545 Duke Cosimo Ide’Medici decided that toensure theimmor- tality ofhis name hewould commission frescoes forthemain chapelofthe church ofSan Lorenzo inFlorence. Hehadmany great painterstochoose from, and intheend hepicked jacopodaPontonno. Gettingoninyears, Pontormo wanted tomake these frescoes hischef d’oeuvre andlegacy.His firstdecision was toclose thechapeloffwith walls, partitions,and blinds. Hewanted no one towitness thecreation ofhismasterpiece,ortosteal his ideas. Hewould outdo Michelangelohimself. When someyoungmen broke into thechapeloutofcuriosity, jacoposealed itoffeven further. Pontormo filled thechape1’s ceiling with biblical scenes—the Creation, Adam and Eve, Noah's ark, onand on.Atthetopofthemiddle will he paintedChrist inhismajesty, raising thedead onjudgment Day.The artist worked onthechapelforelevenyears, rarely leaving it,since hehad de— velopedaphobiaforhuman contact and was afraid hisideas would be stolen. Ponrormo died before completingthefrescoes, and none ofthem has survived. But thegreatRenaissance writer Vasari, afriend ofPontormds who saw thefrescoes shortlyafter the artist’s death, left adescription of what they looked like. There was atotal lack ofproportion. Scenes bumped against scenes, figuresinonestory being juxtaposedwith those in another, inmaddening numbers. Pontormo had become obsessed with de» tallbuthad lostanysense oftheoverall composition.Vasari leftoffhisde~ scription ofthefrescoes bywriting thatifhecontinued, “Ithink Iwouldgo mad and become entangledinthispainting, justasIbelieve that inthe elevenyearsoftimejacopo spentonit,heentangledhimself andanyone elsewho sawit.”Instead ofcrowning Pontormo’s career, thework became hisundoing. These frescoes were visual equivalents oftheeffects ofisolation
