Thetimocratic man's devotion toduty is groundless, andtheoligarchic anddemocratic menrepresent unsteady compromises between dutyanddesire. Socrates canonlyprove thein- feriority ofthetyrannic lifetoGlaucon byway ofthesuperiority of thephilosophic life,ofwhich Glaucon hasonly aglimmering. Tobe [422 ] Interpretive Essay sure,hehasbeenprepared forthechoice bythebeautiful images ofthe philosophic lifein_Book Vllandbythemoral indignation evoked by thedecay ofpolitical lifedepicted inBook VIII. But,although allmen readily admit thattoliveunder atyranny istheworst ofpolitical fates, they arenotsoready toadmit thatthetyrant istheunhappiest ofmen, precisely because hehassucceeded inwinning thestruggle forthose scarce goods which reputedly make amanhappy. Itistothisproblem thatSocrates addresses himself inBook IX. Socrates characterizes thetyrant astheerotic man;anderos, as Cephalus said intheverybeginning ofthedialogue, isamadmaster. Socrates nowmakes afurther distinction among theunnecessary desires; some ofthem arelaw-abiding, andothers arelaw-breaking. The erotic desires lead tobreaking ofthelaw, todaring everything, to thatomnivorous taste forallgood things which makes amantheenemy oflawandothermen.Thedemocratic manwasunerotic, and thisgave himaneasygoing, harmless quality andrendered himinnocuous. His lack oferotic passion prevented himfrom taking anything very seriously. This isnotthecasewith amanwhose sexual passion isvery intense. Glaucon issuchaman,and itisthewish tosatisfy thispartof hisnature that attracts himtotyranny; fortyranny istheonlyregime in which nosatisfaction canbedenied himâ€” itprovides thefreedom, power, andmoney alover needs. Eros isthemost dangerous and powerful ofthedesires, aninfinite longing which consumes allother at- tachments initsheat. It,too,however, isambiguous. Uptothispoint theRepublic hascontinuously attacked eroswhen ithasnotoverlooked it.Itishard toimagine that itsauthor isalsotheauthor oftheSympo- siumandthePhaedrus. But itmustbeobserved thattheerosattacked isthelustforother bodies, andthat this isdone inthename ofboth politics andphilosophy. Politics seems tobehostile toanyform ofex- treme eroticism, butwhat about philosophy? Itisclear inBooks VI andVIIthatloveofwisdom isaform oferos,andthatthehostility to eros islimited tothekindwhich precludes thedevelopment of philosophic eros.The political andphilosophic critiques oferos are therefore notintotalharmony. Iftheradically incomplete discussion of thesoul intheRepublic were tobemade comprehensive, itwould have tobeenlarged toprovide anadequate account oferos.(Forexample, in BookIXitbecomes clear thatthespirited andrational parts ofthesoul have their specific desires; desire isnotlimited tothelowest partwhich hasbeen called thedesiring part.)Thepresent interpretation oferos does serve thepurpose ofmoderating Glaucon's passion, which isboth anti-political andanti-philosophic. Buttheobvious incompleteness of thisunderstanding oferosleads toanawareness ofahidden kinship be- [423 ] THEREPUBLIC tween thetyrant andthephilosopher. There arecertain kinds ofthings (forexample, incest) which agentleman isnoteven willing tothink about, letalone do.Sometimes against hiswillsuchthings findexpression inhisdreams. Thetyrant iswilling both tothink about themandtodo themwhenwideawake. Thephilosopher, aswehaveseen intheRepub- lic,isatleast willing tothink about them, andtheyholdnone ofthepe- culiar horror forhimthattheydoforthegentleman. This isbecause both tyrant andphilosopher depreciate laworconvention (nomos) intheir quest fornature (physis). Eros isnature's demonic voice.Thetyrant and thephilosopher areunited intheir sense oftheir radical incompleteness andtheirlonging forwholeness, intheirpassion andintheirsinglemind- edness. They arethetruly dedicated men. Thepotential tyrant, ifsaved from corruption, may alsoverywell bethepotential philosopher. Theyoungmandrawn totyranny, likethe philosopher, isallowed toflourish only inthedemocracy. Socrates, by curing Glaucon ofhislustfortyrannic pleasures, canindulge hisown lustforbeautiful souls while atthesame time acting thepartofthe good citizen who defends hiscity's regime. Thedemocracy satisfies everything: itletsSocrates beaphilosopher, atleast untilheisseventy; itprovides himwith students byallowing theemergence ofunnecessary andunlawful desires; andbypermitting himtoconvert those possessed bythese desires tophilosophy, itgiveshimtheopportunity toshow thatheloves hiscountry. Socrates attempts toprove toGlaucon that thetyrant isthe unhappiest ofmen. Hisargument consists oftwo parts. Inthe first place, thetyrant cannot fulfill hisdesires; hemust always continue his longing, become
