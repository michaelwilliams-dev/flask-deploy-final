avoids disaster, who isotherwise prepared, who serves theuniversal common good, if hecounts onthepopulace, hewillnever bedeceived andwill have built onasolid good. Princes rising from acivil toanabsolute Principality should beaware. Either they arealone inarms orcommand through magistrates. Inthelatter case they areweaker andatgreater risk because they depend onthepeople who follow themagistrates. Themagistrates, indifficult times, caneasily withdraw thesup- port ofthestate, actagainst thePrince, orrefuse toobey. The Prince cannot quickly seize absolute power. Thecitizens andsub- jects, used tothecommands ofthemagistrates, andincases of conflict, won't obey thePrince. They willalways doubt himin difficult times. Such aPrince cannot relyonthings asthey are when there ispeace andpeople count onthePrince. Then they want todoandpromise everything forhim, and—when there is nodanger —to dieforhim. Butindifficult times, when thestate needs thesupport ofitscitizens, fewcome forward. This ismore dangerous themore exceptional theneed. SoaPrince needs to findawaytomake thecitizens atalltimes inallways dependent onthestate andonhim, andonly then willthey remain faithful. HOW TOMEASURE THE STRENGTH OFPRINCIPALITIES isimportant inevaluating Principalities toknow whether a It Prince controls enough state sothat, inneed, hecandefend himself orrather ifhealways needs thedefenses ofothers. To make thisclear Iwill sayhow Ijudge those who candefend themselves, namely, bywhether theycancallupenough men and draw onenough money tomount agood army anddobattle with anyaggressor. Others always need other people's reinforcements, can't field aforce against theenemy inbattle, andneed totake refuge behind walls atthemercy ofothers. Ofthose ready todo battle, wewillspeak further. Oftheothers who relyonthird par- ties, wecanonly saythey need tofortify andstock themselves, andforget about theopen territory. Those who fortifies them- selves well andwho governs according totherules, willonly be attacked with considerable circumspection. Men dislike difficult undertakings. They donotseemaking aneasy assault where the Prince rules proudly andisnothated bythepopulace. German cities arepretty free, don't control much countryside, obey theemperor —when theywant to,anddon't fearother lords around them. They areadequately fortified sothatanyenemy re- alizes thatanyassault willbetedious andhard. These cities have ditches andwalls around them andmaintain enough artillery. Their stores hold enough drink, food, andfuelforayear. They keep abacklog andpayenough tosupply thearmy, nerve andlife ofthecity, forayear andthepublic citizens doing public works. Their militia arequalified andthey maintain these security forces well. APrince, who fortifies hiscitywell andwho isnothated by THE PRINCE —69 thepopulace, isnoteasy toattack. Ifsomeone attacks him, itis likely they will beshamed because such istheworld thatitis “hard tokeep anarmy inactive andcamping forayear.” Ifsome- oneanswers thatpeople willturn against thePrince when they seetheir holdings outside thewalls burned anddespoiled, Ian- swer thatavalorous Prince willalways overcome these problems ifheoffers hope thattheevilwillnotlastlong, striking fearinto them when thedefenders arestillbrave andready. The Prince need notworry somuch later when things cool offbecause the damage isalready done andthere isnorecourse. Thepopulace tends tounite with thePrince who, since their houses areburned andtheir properties destroyed, isobliged todefend them. Thena- tureofman issuch thathefeels obligated both forbenefits given andbenefits received. Everything considered, aPrince willnot have ahard time keeping incontrol those who, under assault, have something toliveoffanddefend themselves with. OF ECCLESIASTICAL PRINCIPALITIES estill have todeal with Ecclesiastical Principalities . All the difficulties here come before possession of them .They are acquired either byvirtue orbyfortune , but maintained without either .Such Principalities are kept byan- cient religious rules ,which are ofsuch force and quality that their Princes are supported no matter
