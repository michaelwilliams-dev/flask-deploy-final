in a state of dis.content and confusion, and to prevent any peaceful settlement of the country. Firstly, the citizenship in the republics of those days was strictly limited to a small proportion of the inhabitants of the central town of each republic; so that when a small republic was overcome and swallowed up by a more powerful one, its citizens lost all their civic rights; the result this was that the smaller of towns were continually revolting the hope of regaining their in former freedom, or opening their gates to enemies of the republic on the chance of bettering their position. Secondly, as the wealth.ier classes who lived in the towns had reached a higher state of culture than the corresponding classes in other countries, and consequently were inclined to be contemptuous of the arts of war, and as the greater part of the population had more aptitude for commerce than for campaigning, the republics of Italy had be-of come incapable fighting their own battles, and they were driven to adopt the fatal course of depending on mercenary troops to fight their battles for them. These mercenary troops originally consisted soldiers of of fortune who for one reason or another had been left behind in It.aly by invading armies from more northern lands, who had banded themselves together under their chosen leaders, and of THE PRINCE � 15 to continually being increased by recruitment from amongst Italian brigands, malcontents from conquered republics, and other bold or fered their services the highest bidder.

As these bands multiplied, they tended to combine under the leadership of some exceptionally successful captain, and he in his he turn, as soon as had a sufficient following, would retain for himself some town he had captured for this employers, and make it the center round which to carve out a new petty state under his own rule. Thus arose the numberless tyrants who played so large a part in Italy�s history during this chaotic period. These small ty.rants, having no natural ties with the citizens of their new states, and only keeping their position by the most severe measures of repression, were generally hated and became a byword for ruth.less cruelty. And yet they were such a recognized feature of the to of times that their deceit and cruelties ceased be the subject moral blame; on the contrary, the more ruthless and treacherous their conduct, the greater prestige they acquired �
