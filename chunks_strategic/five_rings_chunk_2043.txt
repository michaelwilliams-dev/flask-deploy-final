theassumption thatthephenomena thepolis comprises canbecomprehended bycomparing thevarious usesofthewoi-d. Moreover, itshould beborne in mind thatwords like"statesman" and"citizen" arebased ontheroot polis. [The citizen {polites) isliterally "onewhobelongs tothecity," andthestates- man (politikos) is"onewhoknows thethings ofthecity."|Politics (politika) [439 ] THEREPUBLIC ismerely "what hastodowith thecity."

Thebookwhich describes the best political life isappropriately entitled "theregime," theonly true orthe bestregime, justasthebook ofallbooks isentitled simply theBible, thebook. Such anapproach tothepolitical problem ischaracteristically Platonic, and anattempt torecover theGreek understanding ofhuman things requires a consideration ofthesense inwhich thepoliteia isthesingle most important political factand thecause ofmen's characters andways oflife.The useofthisword should, therefore, befollowed attentively throughout this book.

Itwas, therefore, theap- propriate place inwhich toconsider outlandish ways oflife.Furthermore, it wasacenter ofthedemocratic party. Sometime after thesupposed dateofthe action ofthisdialogue (probably around 411b.c), in404b.c, thePiraeus wasthestronghold oftheresistance against thedespotic group ofmen,known as the"Thirty Tyrants," whoruled Athens after itsdefeat bySparta inthePelo- ponnesian War. Inthat resistance, thefamily ofCephalus, especially Lysias (cf328bandnote 7),played aleading role.Polemarchus wasexecuted bythe tyrants. Socrates wassuspected ofsympathy withandinfluence over the leaders ofthetyranny because several hadbeenamong hiscompanions. Inthe Apology (32c-d) hemakes apoint ofshowing hisdisagreement with this oligarchy, andthegrounds ofthatdisagreement. Buthisposition inrelation to thedemocracy remains ambiguous. Theconversation intheRepublic takes place intheshadow ofthe"Thirty." Theyhadmuch todowiththeexecution, notonlyofPolemarchus, but also, indirectly, ofSocrates; andthedialogue treats, atleast inpart, ofthetyrannical ambitions ofSocrates' companions. Themenwhogather here inhappy days foratheoretical conversation are soon tofallonevilones inthepractice ofpolitics. Theproblems ofthatprac- tice,which arelater toberevealed indeed, arehere discussed.
