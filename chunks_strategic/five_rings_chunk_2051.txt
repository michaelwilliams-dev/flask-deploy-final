Scheme means "outward appearance," "posture," "attitude," or"bearing." Alltheterms inthe following enumeration ofqualities pertaining tomusic begin vdththeprefix eu, meaning "good," ora,meaning "lack of,"which provides them with aunity notvisible inEnglish. 53.Thesameword isusedbyThrasymachus (348c) todescribe thejust man.There itwasrendered as"innocence." Here Socrates uses itinitsliteral andetymologically precise sense.Theword suffered thesame alterations in sense inGreek asdidtheword "innocent" inEnglish. 54.Sons ofAsclepius. Originally thetermmeant thefamily ofAsclepius (thefounder ofmedicine), forwhom medicine wasafamily trade. Itgradually began tobeused forthepriests ofhiscult,andgenerally allhealers, whowere hissonsbyadoption, asitwere. 55. Iliad, XI,624-641. ItisnotEurypylus who iswounded and receives these attentions, butMachaon, asonofAsclepius andadoctor (cf. Ion,538bwhere thepassage isquoted andMachaon properly referred to). Patroclus isnoteven present atthisscene. Machaon's wound isapparently not serious, and thisdraught isprepared forhimandNestor asrefreshment. Eurypylus, wounded inthesame engagement, asks foranentirely different treatment from Patroclus (XI,828-836). (Cf.408a, below, andnote 59.) 56.Theword for"prize" ispractically thesame asthat for"oldage" (geras andgenis). 57.ThePhocylides passage isonlyavailable infragmentary form, but its sensemayvery wellhavebeen ofthis sort:"make aliving first,thenworry about virtue." Socrates makes thisintoanexhortation tovirtue. 58.Politikon, amanwhoknows thebusiness ofthecity. 59. Iliad, IV,218—219. Inthiscase itisMachaon alonewho treats Menelaus. InthelasthalfofthelineSocrates drops aword found inHomer. Homer's text reads: "Inhisknowledge hesprinkled gentle salves onthe wound." The half-line asSocrates renders itistobefound inthemouth of Eurypylus ashetellsofthetreatment hewants (XI,830); this isthesame Eurypylus whom Socrates substitutes forMachaon at405e (cfnote 55).In thesetwo citations, Socrates deliberately changes Homer's emphasis soasto minimize theattention necessary tothebodies ofeven heroes, aswell asthe amount ofknowledge required foratrue artofmedicine. Abstraction fromthe needs ofthebody isthecondition oftheactualization ofthisbestregime. Another such condition isasimplicity and isolation thatmake thedevelofH ment oftheartshighly unlikely. Glaucon raises thisquestion intheimmediate sequel.
