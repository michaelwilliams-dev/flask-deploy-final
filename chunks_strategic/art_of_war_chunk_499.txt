a breach between the sovereign and his ministers." The necessity for extreme cau- tion, however, in dealing with "inward spies," appears from an historical incident related by Ho Shih: "Lo Shang, Governor of I-Chou, sent his general Wei Po to attack the rebel Li Hsiung of Shu in his stronghold at P�i. After each side had experienced a number of victories and defeats, Li Hsiung had recourse to the services of a certain P�o-t�ai, a native of Wu-tu. He began to have him whipped until the blood came, and then sent him off to Lo Shang, whom he was to delude by offering to cooperate with him from inside the city, and to give a fire signal at the right moment for mak- ing a general assault. Lo Shang, confiding in these promises, march out all his best troops, and placed Wei Po and others at their head with orders to attack at P�o-t�ai�s bidding. Meanwhile, Li Hsiung�s general, Li Hsiang, had prepared an ambuscade on their line of march; and P�o-t�ai, having reared long scaling-ladders against the city walls, now lighted the beacon- fire. Wei Po�s men raced up on seeing the signal and began climbing the ladders as fast as they could, while others were drawn up by ropes lowered from above. More than a hundred of Lo Shang�s soldiers entered the city in this way, every one of whom was forthwith beheaded. Li Hsiung then charged with all his forces, both inside and outside the city, and routed the enemy completely." [This happened in 303 A.D. I do not know where Ho Shih got the story from. It is not given in the biography of Li Hsiung or that of his father Li T�e, CHIN SHU, ch. 120, 121.] 11. Having CONVERTED SPIES, getting hold of the enemy�s spies and using them for our own purposes. [By means of heavy bribes and liberal promises detaching them from the enemy�s service, and inducing them to carry back false information as well as to spy in turn on their own countrymen. On the other hand, Hsiao Shih-hsien says that we pretend not to have detected him, but contrive to let him carry away a false impression of what is going on. Several of the commentators accept this as an alternative definition; but that it is not what Sun Tzu meant is conclusively proved by his subsequent remarks about treating the converted spy generously (ss. 21 sqq.). Ho Shih notes three occasions on which converted spies were used with conspicuous success: (1) by T�ien Tan in his defense of Chi-mo (see supra, p. 90); (2) by Chao She on his march to O-yu (see p. 57); and by the wily Fan Chu in 260 B.C., when Lien P�o was conducting a defensive campaign against Ch�in. The King of Chao strongly disapproved of Lien P�o�s cautious and dilatory CHAPTER 14. THE USE OF SPIES 125 methods, which had been unable to avert a series of minor disasters, and therefore lent a
