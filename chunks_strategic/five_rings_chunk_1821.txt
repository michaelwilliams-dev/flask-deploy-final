Although Swiss and Spanish soldiers are considered mighty fierce ,both lack something that athird order can trust tooppose and vanquish them ,The Spanish fear the cavalry ,and the Swiss fear the infantry inhand tohand combat .Experience has shown that the Spanish cannot withstand the French cavalry ,and Span- ish infantry has overwhelmed the Swiss .Although this has not been seen wholesale ,itwas seen inglimpses atRavenna when the Spanish opposed the German ranks —which are modeled the same asthe Swiss .The Spaniards with their agility and the spear- pointed shield got under the spears ofthe Germans ,who were helpless tostop them . Ifthe cavalry had not driven them back ,they would have decimated everyone .Knowing the weaknesses ofthese forces ,it would bepossible tomodel anew force that could sustain acav- alry rush and not fear hand tohand combat .This can be done with innovative arms and byfielding the troops differently .Such innovations give anew Prince both greatness and repute .This moment ofhistory should be grasped sothat Italy finally finds her redeemer .Icannot stress more how welcome hewould bein allprovinces where this foreign horde has descended .He would be received with avengeance ,with firm faith ,with sympathy , and tears .What doors would not open ?What populace would not offer obedience ?Who would envy him ?What Italian would deny him allegiance ?The domination ofthe barbarian stinks .
