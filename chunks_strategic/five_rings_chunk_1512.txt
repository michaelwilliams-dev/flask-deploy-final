Weil ex- plainedtoGeezil that hehimself was aboxing trainer, that Gross was one ofthepromising piizefightershetrained, and that hehad asked Gross to come alongtomake sure thefighter stayedinshape.For apromising fighter, Gross wasunimpressive looking—hehadgrayhair and abeer belly—butGeezil was soexcited about thedeal that hedidn‘t really think about theman’s flabby appearance. Once inGalesburg, Weil and hisuncle went tofetch thefinanciers while Geezil waited inahotel room with Gross, whopromptly putonhis boxing trunks. AsGeezil half watched, Gross began toshadowbox. Dis- tracted ashewas, Geezil ignored howbadlytheboxer wheezed after afew minutes ofexercise, althoughhisstyleseemed realenough. Anhour later, Weil and hisuncle reappeared with thefinanciers, animpressive, intimidat inggmup ofmen, allwearing fancysuits. Themeeting went well and the fi- nanciers agreedtosell thelodge toGeezil, who had alreadyhad the $35,000 wired toalocal bank.

Finallyoneofthem noticed theboxer inthe corner ofthe room. Weil explainedwhat hewasdoingthere. The financier countered that hetoohad aboxer inhisentourage, whom henamed. Weil laughed brazenlyand exclaimed that his man could easilyknock outtheir man. Conversation escalated into argument.Intheheat ofpassion, Weil challenged the men toabet.

FinallyGeezil had heard enough. Unwillingtojeopardizehisdeal withanyillwill, heoffered his own $35,000 cash forpart ofthebet. Even if helostthat, hewould wire for more moneyand stillmake a.profitonthe sale ofthelodge. The uncle andnephewthanked him. With their own $15,000 and Geezil’s $35,000 they wouldmanagetohave enough forthe bet. That evening,asGeezil watched the two boxers rehearse thefixin thehotel room, hismind reeled atthekillinghewasgoingtomake from both theboxing match and thesaleofthelodge.
