�Do not stop an army on its way home� (Sun Tzu, The Art of War, �Armed Struggle�). In the year 198, near the end of the Han dynasty, the warlord Cao Cao, who was to become one of the most powerful competitors for the remains of the Han empire, had one of his rivals surrounded when another rival sent reinforcements to oppose him. The reinforcements took up a position behind Cao Cao, guarding the passes through the mountains to cut off his way back. Cao Cao�s army couldn�t go forward, and now it had enemies before and behind it. That night Cao Cao�s men tunneled through the defiles to give the appearance that they were trying to get away. In reality they lay in ambush, waiting for the enemies to come in pursuit. Cao Cao�s rival came after him with his entire army, and Cao Cao�s soldiers destroyed it in a surprise attack. Later Cao Cao told one of his advisors, �The enemy tried to �stop an army on its way home,� and also fought with us on �deadly ground,� so I knew we would win.� Pursuit and Battle Liu Ji said: Whenever you pursue people on the run, chasing beaten soldiers, you must make sure whether they are really fleeing or just feigning.

The rule is �When you pursue people on the run, do not desist; but if the enemy stops on the road, then think twice� (�Sima�s Art of War,� �Deploying Groups�). In the year 618, the founder of the newly declared Tang dynasty moved against one of the last warlords of the preceding Sui dynasty. One of the Sui warlord�s generals, opposing the Tang founder, was severely beaten and put to flight. The Tang founder chased down the Sui survivors and surrounded them. Many of the Sui commanders surrendered right then and there on the battlefield. The Tang founder gave them back their horses and let them go. Moments later, each of the Sui commanders came riding back. Now the Tang founder knew the real condition of the Sui warlord. As the leader of the new dynasty advanced his troops to close in, he sent a diplomat to the warlord to explain the advantages of capitulation and the risks of resistance. The warlord finally surrendered. The generals of the young Tang founder congratulated him, and took the opportunity to ask, �When you had the enemy on the run, you left your infantry and rode right up to the city ramparts without even taking
