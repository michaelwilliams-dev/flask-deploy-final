profited more from using those men who aresuspect than using hisown confidants. Pandolfo Petrucci, Prince ofSiena (1500-1512), ruled more with help ofsuspect personages than with men offaith. But onecannot saytoomuch because thematter varies with thesub- ject. Only note thisthatmen, who areenemies attheoutset of tenure, ifthey have quality, make aPrince strong ifthey canbe won over. They become themore loyal themore theyneed toblot outthesinister reputation they hadbefore. ThePrince getsmore useoutofthem than outofloyal servants who neglect things. While investigating this matter, Idon't want tooverlook THE PRINCE —111 Princes who having taken over astate with thehelp ofsome of thecitizens should keep inmind their interest andfavor it.Ifthe tiewith them isnotnatural andonly arose because theywere dis- content, itwillbehard tokeep them asfriends, because itwillbe hard tosatisfy their needs. Totellthetruth, ancient andmodern examples show thatitismuch easier topacify apopulation that was content before your takeover even though thismade them your enemies than itistocontent those who favored youand your purposes because they were discontent beforehand. Princes, toconsolidate their power, areaccustomed tobuild- ingfortresses. These harness andbreak those who have designs against them. They give secure refuge from sudden attack. Ifavor these because they have been used since antiquity. Still, Niccolo Vitelli (Citta' diCastello, 1482) inourtimes toredown twoforts inCitta diCastello tohold that state. Guido Ubaldo (Urbino, 1504), theDuke ofUrbino, returned tohisstate after being thrown outbyCesare Borgia andtoredown alltheforts ofthe province believing itlesseasy tolose dominion without them. The Bentivogli onreturning toBologna in1511 also didthis. Forts areuseful ornotaccording tothetimes. They help inone wayandarehandicaps inanother way. Iwillmake clear how this isso. ThePrince who fears hisown people more than foreign ene- mies needs tobuild forts. Those who feartheforeign enemy more should forget forts. TheSforza's castle inMilan hascaused and willcause more wars than anything else inthatstate. The best fortress istonotbehated bythepublic. Even while youhave forts andaslong asthepublic hates you, they willnotsave you. Ifthepopulace hasarms, they willnever lack foreigners tohelp them. Inourtimes, one sees few occasions when forts have helped thePrinces except inthecase oftheCountess ofForlì. When herhusband, Count Girolamo died (1488) sheescaped into theforttowait thehelp ofLudovico theBlack ofMilan, andre- covered herstate. The situation was such thatforeigners could notreinforce thepopulace. However, when Cesare Borgia at- tacked thefortress didnothelp because thepeople joined with the 112—Niccolò Machiavelli foreigner. Shewould have been more secure ifthepeople hadnot hated herthan byhaving afortress. Considering allthis, Icom- mend both those who build forts andthose who don’t. Iwarn those who count onthese castles butunderestimate thehateofthe populace.
