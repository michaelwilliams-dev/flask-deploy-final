army are more intimate relations to be maintained than with spies. [Tu Mu and Mei Yao-ch�en point out that the spy is privileged to enter even the general�s private sleeping-tent.] None should be more liberally rewarded. In no other business should greater secrecy be preserved. [Tu Mu gives a graphic touch: all communication with spies should be carried "mouth-to-ear." The following remarks on spies may be quoted from Turenne, who made perhaps larger use of them than any previous commander: "Spies are attached to those who give them most, he who pays them ill is never served. They should never be known to anybody; nor should they know one another. When they propose anything very material, secure their persons, or have in your possession their wives and children as hostages for their fidelity. Never communicate anything to them but what is absolutely necessary that they should know. 2 ] 1. Spies cannot be usefully employed without a certain intuitive sagacity. [Mei Yao-ch�en says: "In order to use them, one must know fact from falsehood, and be able to discriminate between honesty and double-dealing." Wang Hsi in a different interpretation thinks more along the lines of "intu- itive perception" and "practical intelligence." Tu Mu strangely refers these 2"Marshal Turenne," p. 311. CHAPTER 14. THE USE OF SPIES 127 attributes to the spies themselves: "Before using spies we must assure ourselves as to their integrity of character and the extent of their experi- ence and skill." But he continues: "A brazen face and a crafty disposition are more dangerous than mountains or rivers; it takes a man of genius to penetrate such." So that we are left in some doubt as to his real opinion on the passage."] 1. They cannot be properly managed without benevolence and straightfor- wardness. [Chang Yu says: "When you have attracted them by substantial offers, you must treat them with absolute sincerity; then they will work for you with all their might."] 1. Without subtle ingenuity of mind, one cannot make certain of the truth of their reports. [Mei Yao-ch�en says: "Be on your guard against the possibility of spies going over to the service of the enemy."] 1. Be subtle! be subtle! and use your spies for every kind of business. [Cf. VI. ss. 9.] 1. If a secret piece of news is divulged by a spy before the time is ripe, he must be put to death together with the man to whom the secret was told. [Word for word, the translation here is: "If spy matters are heard before [our plans] are carried out," etc. Sun Tzu�s main point in this passage is: Whereas you kill the spy himself "as a punishment for letting out the secret," the object of killing the other man is only, as Ch�en Hao puts it, "to stop his mouth" and prevent news leaking any further. If it had already been repeated to others, this object would not be gained. Either way, Sun Tzu lays himself open to the
