wrote books on war, and they are linked together in popular speech as "Sun and Wu." But Wu Ch�i�s remarks on war are less weighty, his rules are rougher and more crudely stated, and there is not the same unity of plan as in Sun Tzu�s work, where the style is terse, but the meaning fully brought out. The following is an extract from the "Impartial Judgments in the Garden of Literature" by Cheng Hou: 46T�UNG K�AO, loc. cit. 47A notable person in his day. His biography is given in the SAN KUO CHIH, ch. 10. 48See XI. ss. 58, note. 49HOU HAN SHU, ch. 17 ad init. 50SAN KUO CHIH, ch. 54. 51SUNG SHIH, ch. 365 ad init. 52The few Europeans who have yet had an opportunity of acquainting themselves with Sun Tzu are not behindhand in their praise. In this connection, I may perhaps be excused for quoting from a letter from Lord Roberts, to whom the sheets of the present work were submitted previous to publication: "Many of Sun Wu�s maxims are perfectly applicable to the present day, and no. 11 [in Chapter VIII] is one that the people of this country would do well to take to heart." 53Ch. 140. 54See IV. ss. 3. 55The allusion may be to Mencius VI. 2. ix. 2. CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 22 Sun Tzu�s 13 chapters are not only the staple and base of all military men�s training, but also compel the most careful attention of scholars and men of letters. His sayings are terse yet elegant, simple yet profound, perspicuous and eminently practical. Such works as the LUN YU, the I CHING and the great Commentary,56 as well as the writings of Mencius, Hsun K�uang and Yang Chu, all fall below the level of Sun Tzu. Chu Hsi, commenting on this, fully admits the first part of the criticism, although he dislikes the audacious comparison with the venerated classical works. Language of this sort, he says, "encourages a ruler�s bent towards unrelenting warfare and reckless militarism." 1. Apologies for War Accustomed as we are to think of China as the greatest peace-loving nation on earth, we are in some danger of forgetting that her experience of war in all its phases has also been such as no modern State can parallel. Her long military annals stretch back to a point at which they are lost in the mists of time. She had built the Great Wall and was maintaining a huge standing army along her frontier centuries before the first Roman legionary was seen on the Danube. What with the perpetual collisions of the ancient feudal States, the grim conflicts with Huns, Turks and other invaders after the centralization of government, the terrific upheavals which accompanied the overthrow of so many dynasties, besides the countless rebellions and minor disturbances that have flamed up and flickered out again one by one, it is hardly too much to say that the clash of arms has never ceased to resound in one
