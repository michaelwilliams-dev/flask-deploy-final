isanaturally strong man,andfor himtoobey thelawswould serve theadvantage oftheconventionally, orpolitically, stronger butofthenaturally weaker. But,from either standpoint, thelaw-abiding man isaninnocent, andGlaucon adopts [341 ] THEREPUBLIC Thrasymachus' notion ofthejustman asthesimple, honest server of other men's interest. And itisthisunderstanding ofjustice thatGlau- conasksSocrates todefend. Socrates mustshow thatthemanwho is whipped, racked, chained, andhashiseyesburned outbecause men believe him tobeunjust willbeblessedly happy ifonlyhepossesses justice; while theprudent, courageous, skilled server ofhisown interest ismiserable because helacks justice. Socrates iscommanded toprove that selfless dedication isrewarded bynature, that justice istheone thing most needful. After Glaucon completes hisexposition ofthenature ofjustice andmakes hisdemands foritsdefense, hisbrother enters thescene to state hisproblem. Although thetwospeeches seem supplementary, they arereally quite different and setconflicting tasks forSocrates. As Glaucon wasdaring, Adeimantus ismoderate; asGlaucon turned to nature, Adeimantus turns toopinion; asGlaucon paid attention to whathesaw,Adeimantus pays attention towhathehears.He ispar- ticularly addicted topoetry. Hedoes notmake anargument forthe superiority ofinjustice, but isperplexed bywhathehears about justice. Although justice ispraised, itisnotpraised foritself but for its rewards, andthose rewards consist incertain pleasures which canbe enjoyed bymenwho areunjust. Itisnotjustice butthereputation for justice which getsthese rewards. Theaccounts ofgodsandmen con- tained intheclassic poems support thisconclusion. According tothese poems, some justmen areunhappy, andunjustmencanwinthefavor ofthegods. Everything that isknown about men's duties comes from thepoetic tradition, thelaws, andparental training; and allineffect agree that justice itself does notproduce happiness, thatthere are substitutes forjustice, thatjustactsarenotpleasant orgood. Itmaybe improper toquestion thetradition; but,once questioned, itsinternal contradictions lead tothesame conclusion asthatofbothThrasyma- chusandGlaucon. Either thetales aretrue,andoneshould seem rather than hejust; orthey arenot true, jnwhich case nature, theonly substitute forthem, teaches thesame thing.Welivewithin ahorizon constructed bythepoets, ahorizon bounded bythepresence ofthe gods. Cephalus, whospends hisoldageusing hismoney toplacate the gods' possible wrath athisearlier unjust deeds, ismost representative ofthishuman condition. There isnoother available account ofthe sanctions ofjustice, and thisone isnotadequate tomake itchoicewor- thy. Thus Adeimantus, too,wishes tohear anewandadequate praise ofjustice, butwhatheasks forisdifferent fromwhat hisbrother asked for.Just asthelatter desired anargument forpureandearnest dedica- [342 ] Interpretive Essay Hon, soAdeimantus now reveals hisdeepest wishes byinsisting that justice beeasyandpleasant. Itshould initself incorporate thead- vantages conventionally saidtoresult from itspractice. Thepoetsprom- isejustmen great honors andsensual pleasures inthis lifeandthe next.Without making itquite -explicit, Adeimantus longs forjustice it- selftobelikeortobeanadequate substitute forthese honors and pleasures. Justice isalways said tobehard, andthere areways toget around itsnecessity. Ifitissounpleasant, whybejust?Ashesays, in these conditions only amanwhose divine nature renders injustice distasteful tohim, oronewhohasknowledge, would resist theoppor- tunity todoinjustice. Inorder tobeconvincing tobothGlaucon and Adeimantus, Socrates must show^ thatjustice satisfies even themanwho loses everything for it,andthat hishappiness isakin tothesensations ofthemanimmersed inthepleasures ofthesenses. Attheconclusion oftheunjust arguments ofGlaucon andAdei- mantus, Socrates professes hisincapacity tosucceed atataskofthe magnitude oftheoneimposed onhim.Butherecognizes thatpiety for- bidshim toabandon justice under attack. Under pressure from theen- tiregroup heagrees todefend justice. However, hedoes notrespond directly tothequestions ofhisyoung companions. Rather than criticize their arguments orpresent acounter argument ofhisown,heinvites them toshare anadventure with him.They aretojointogether inthe greatest andmost revealing ofpolitical acts,thefounding ofacity.Soc- rates thusengages their desire forglory; although they arenotindif- ferent tothedesires which moved theother speakers, they,andpar- ticularly Glaucon, areanimated byadiflferent passion: itisnotmoney thatthey love somuch, buthonor. Thrasymachus had oflfered them tyranny, thehighest position inthe city. Socrates inflames their imagination withevengrander dreams. Thefounders ofacityaremore powerful andmore revered than are
