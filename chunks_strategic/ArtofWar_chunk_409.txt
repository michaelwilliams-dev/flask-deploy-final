War section of the great Imperial encyclopedia printed in 1726, the KU CHIN T�U SHU CHI CH�ENG. Another copy at my disposal of what is practically the same text, with slight variations, is that contained in the "Eleven philosophers of the Chou and Ch�in dynasties" [1758]. And the Chinese printed in Capt. Calthrop�s first edition is evidently a similar version which has filtered through Japanese channels. So things remained until Sun Hsing-yen [1752-1818], a distinguished antiquarian and classical scholar, who claimed to be an actual descendant of Sun Wu,35 accidentally discovered a copy of Chi T�ien-pao�s long-lost work, when on a visit to the library of the Hua-yin temple.36 Appended to it was the I SHUO of Cheng Yu-Hsien, men- tioned in the T�UNG CHIH, and also believed to have perished. This is what Sun Hsing-yen designates as the "original edition (or text)" � a rather misleading name, for it cannot by any means claim to set before us the text of Sun Tzu in its pristine purity. Chi T�ien-pao was a careless compiler, and appears to have been content to reproduce the somewhat debased version current in his day, without troubling to collate it with the earliest editions then available. Fortunately, two versions of Sun Tzu, even older than the newly discovered work, were still extant, one buried in the T�UNG TIEN, Tu Yu�s great treatise on the Constitution, the other similarly enshrined in the T�AI P�ING YU LAN encyclopedia. In both the complete text is to be found, though split up into fragments, intermixed with other matter, and scattered piecemeal over a number of dif- ferent sections. Considering that the YU LAN takes us back to the year 983, and the T�UNG TIEN about 200 years further still, to the middle of the T�ang dynasty, the value of these early transcripts of Sun Tzu can hardly be overestimated. Yet the idea of utilizing them does not seem to have occurred to anyone until Sun Hsing-yen, acting under Government instructions, undertook a thorough recension of the text. This is his own account: Because of the numerous mistakes in the text of Sun Tzu which his editors had handed down, the Government ordered that the ancient edition [of Chi T�ien-pao] should be used, and that the text should be revised and corrected throughout. It happened that Wu Nien-hu, the Governor Pi Kua, and Hsi, a graduate of the second degree, had all devoted themselves to 35Preface ad fin: "My family comes from Lo-an, and we are really descended from Sun Tzu. I am ashamed to say that I only read my ancestor�s work from a literary point of view, without comprehending the military technique. So long have we been enjoying the blessings of peace!" 36Hoa-yin is about 14 miles from T�ung-kuan on the eastern border of Shensi. The temple in question is still visited by those about the ascent of the Western Sacred Mountain. It is mentioned in a text as being "situated five LI east of the district city
