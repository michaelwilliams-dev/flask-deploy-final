Every one holds views according to his interest, and imagines he has abundant grounds for them. For with most men judgment has to give way to inclination. It may occur that two may meet with exactly opposite views and yet each thinks to have reason on his side, yet reason is always true to itself and never has two faces. In such a di.culty a prudent man will go to work with care, for his decision of his opponent's view may cast doubt on his own.

Even when alone he acts as if the eyes of the whole world were upon him. For as he knows that sooner or later all will be known, so he considers those to be present as witnesses who must afterwards hear of the deed. He that wished the whole world might always see him did not mind that his neighbours could see him over their walls. Three Things go to a Prodigy. They are the choicest gifts of Heaven's prodigality--a fertile genius, a profound intellect, a pleasant and re�ned taste. To think well is good, to think right is better: 'tis the understanding of the good. It will not do for the judgment
