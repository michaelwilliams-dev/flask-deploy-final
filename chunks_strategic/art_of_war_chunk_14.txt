that it was actually carried out by him 32There is this to be said for the later period, that the feud would tend to grow more bitter after each encounter, and thus more fully justify the language used in XI. ss. 30. CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 15 in conjunction with Wu Yuan,33 Po P�ei and Fu Kai? It is obvious that any attempt to reconstruct even the outline of Sun Tzu�s life must be based almost wholly on conjecture. With this necessary proviso, I should say that he probably entered the service of Wu about the time of Ho Lu�s accession, and gathered experience, though only in the capacity of a subordinate officer, during the intense mil- itary activity which marked the first half of the prince�s reign.34 If he rose to be a gen- eral at all, he certainly was never on an equal footing with the three above mentioned. He was doubtless present at the investment and occupation of Ying, and witnessed Wu�s sudden collapse in the following year. Yueh�s attack at this critical juncture, when her rival was embarrassed on every side, seems to have convinced him that this upstart kingdom was the great enemy against whom every effort would henceforth have to be directed. Sun Wu was thus a well-seasoned warrior when he sat down to write his famous book, which according to my reckoning must have appeared towards the end, rather than the beginning of Ho Lu�s reign. The story of the women may possibly have grown out of some real incident occurring about the same time. As we hear no more of Sun Wu after this from any source, he is hardly likely to have survived his patron or to have taken part in the death-struggle with Yueh, which began with the disaster at Tsuili. If these inferences are approximately correct, there is a certain irony in the fate which decreed that China�s most illustrious man of peace should be contemporary with her greatest writer on war. 1.2 The Text of Sun Tzu I have found it difficult to glean much about the history of Sun Tzu�s text. The quo- tations that occur in early authors go to show that the "13 chapters" of which Ssu-ma Ch�ien speaks were essentially the same as those now extant. We have his word for it that they were widely circulated in his day, and can only regret that he refrained from discussing them on that account. Sun Hsing-yen says in his preface: During the Ch�in and Han dynasties Sun Tzu�s ART OF WAR was in general use amongst military commanders, but they seem to have treated it as a work of mysterious import, and were unwilling to expound it for the benefit of posterity. Thus it came about that Wei Wu was the first to write a commentary on it. As we have already seen, there is no reasonable ground to suppose that Ts�ao Kung tampered with the text. But the text itself is often so obscure, and
