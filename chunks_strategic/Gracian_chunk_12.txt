observations he deciphers the most hidden recesses of his nature. Keen observation, subtile insight, judicious inference: with these he discovers, notices, grasps, and comprehends everything. Never lose Self-respect, or be too familiar with oneself. Let your own right feeling be the true standard of your rectitude, and owe more to the strictness of your own self-judgment than to all external sanctions. Leave o. anything unseemly more from regard for your own self-respect than from fear of external authority. Pay regard to that and there is no need of Seneca's imaginary tutor. Know how to Choose well. Most of life depends thereon. It needs good taste and correct judgment, for which neither intellect nor study su.ces. To be choice, you must choose, and for this two things are needed: to be able to choose at all, and then to choose the best.

He has done much who leaves nothing over till to-morrow. Festina lente is a royal motto. Know how to show your Teeth. Even hares can pull the mane of a dead lion. There is no joke about courage. Give way to the �rst and you must yield to the second, and so on till the last, and to gain your point at last costs as much trouble as would have gained much more at �rst. Moral courage exceeds physical; it should be like a sword kept ready for use in the scabbard of caution. It Is the shield of great place; moral cowardice lowers one more than physical.
