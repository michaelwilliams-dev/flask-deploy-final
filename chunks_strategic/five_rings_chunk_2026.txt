ofthelineandarebest represented bythemathematicians. They escape toaworld ofuniver- sality andarecharmed bythecompetence oftheirreason toorder and [405 ] THEREPUBLIC explain thatworld. Thehomogeneity ofnumbers which canapply toall things permits them toreduce alltheparticularities intheworld touni- ties.They tend toforget thequestionableness oftheirownbeginnings orprinciples andthenatural heterogeneity ofthedifferent kinds of things; they areforgetful ofqualitative differences and,hence, ofthe ideas. Asthepiousmenwere hostile totheideas because theideas threatened theheterogeneity oftheir world, these competent men are hostile totheideas because they threaten thehomogeneity oftheir world. Suchwere theearly philosophers whowhile watching thesky fellinto holes, themen ridiculed byAristophanes because their science could notunderstand man, theonlybeingwhounderstands. These twotemptations areaided bytwoofman's most noble arts: poetry andmathematics. Both ofthese artsarenecessary anduseful, butboth tend toemancipate themselves from philosophy and re- enforce thehostility toit.Inorder toresist these temptations, aman's reason mustbeboth daring andmoderate. Socrates, inhisreform of philosophy, showed theway inwhich these virtues mustbecombined. Amanmustbedaring inhisquest forthe firstcauses ofallthings and inhisrefusal toaccept thesacred opinions ofthecave.Buthemustbe moderate andnotlook directly atthesunforfearofbeing blinded and losing thedistinctions among thevarious kinds ofthings.Hemust look atthereflection ofthesunandthethings itilluminates; that is,he must nottrytoapprehend being directly butmust trytodiscern itin theopinions about thevarious kinds ofbeings. Dialectic, theartof friendly conversation, aspracticed bySocrates, isthiscombination of daring andmoderation. Intheaccount ofthecave given here, aman isliberated from his bonds notbyhisown efforts butbyateacher whocompels himtoturn tothelight.Theactualmode ofthisturning isrepresented intheaction oftheRepublic. OldCephalus hasopinions about justice; inthe investigation ofjustice, onedoes notbegin bytrying tolook atjustice, orbyconstructing definitions, butbyexamining these opinions about it.Cephalus holds twocontradictory opinions about justice, butboth seem necessary forhisunderstanding ofjustice. One isthusforced to seek foranother andmore adequate opinion which cancomprehend thephenomena covered bythecontradictory opinions. Thethoughtful observer recognizes thattheopinions ofthemen inthecave are self- contradictory andthusmeaningless asthey stand. Buttheir very con- tradiction points beyond them tomore intelligible opinions andtoob- jectswhich donotadmit ofsuch ambiguity. Themany contradictory opinions aresolicited bytheone,comprehensive, opinion. Dialectic, beginning from thecommonly held opinions, willlead toanultimate [406 ] Interpretive Essay agreement. Itisthisactivity which canguide ustothediscovery ofthe natural objects, and itimpHes thatwebegin from thephenomena aswe seethem, taking them seriously inaneffort toclarify them. Itisonly bywayofourimprisonment thataliberation canbeeffected; andour speech about things, ifproperly examined, isthereflection ofthelight inthecave. The liberation, once effected, results ingreat happiness; thesoul Carrie."? onitsproper activity with itsproper objects. And, asaresult, thefreedmanhas .agreat contempt forthecave, itsshadows and its inhabitants. Hewants always toliveoutinthelight; theothers donot know they areslaves, sothey arecontent; butheknows itandcannot bear toliveamong them. Nothing inthecitycontributes tohisspecific pleasures, andhewants nothing from it;heisnot,asare allothers, a potential exploiter ofthe city.Atlasttheproblem offinding disin- terested rulers issolved. But italsobecomes clear thatthephilosophers donotwant toberulers andthattheymustbecompelled. Compulsion isnecessary since rhetoric could notdeceive philosophers. Now the tables areturned. Previously itappeared thatthephilosophers areanx- ioustoruleandmustpersuade arecalcitrant populace. Intheinvestiga- tionofthephilosophic nature ithasbyaccident, asitwere, emerged that philosophers want nothing from thecityand that their con- templative activity isperfectly engrossing, leaving neither timenorin- terest forruling. So,ifphilosophers aretorule, itmustbethecitythat forces them todoso;and itisinthephilosophers' interest tokeep the knowledge oftheir kingly skills from thepeople. Itisaperfect circle. Thepeople mustbepersuaded toaccept thephilosophers; butthe philosophers mustbecompelled topersuade thepeople tocompel them torule.Andwhowould dothat? This isnotanaccidental difficulty of communication between thetwo sides; itisgrounded onrealconflicts ofinterest. Glaucon objects totheinjustice offorcing thephilosophers to return tothecave. This isinjustice inthefullest sense oftheword: it would becontrary totheirgood toreturn. Ortoput itintotheformula forjustice: thecitywould force oneman todotwojobs, tobeboth philosopher andking.
