or leadership to concentrate them. In both classical and modern terms, the I Ching�s statement that �it is beneficial to see great people� is also taken to refer to the importance of education, exposing the population to the thoughts of great minds; this too is a form of leadership, one which philosophers believed should also inform the exercise of personal leadership. The final word of the I Ching�s observation on the general theme of �Contention� says, �It is not beneficial to cross great rivers.� According to Cheng Yi, this means that one should take safety precautions and not become reckless in contention. According to the tradition of strategists, knowledge of conditions is the basis of caution and preparedness: in its chapter on �Planning a Siege,� The Art of War says, �If you do not know others and do not know yourself, you will be imperiled in every single battle.� In actual conflict, this naturally extends to matters of logistics: in the chapter on �Doing Battle,� The Art of War also says, �When a country is impoverished by military operations, it is because of transporting supplies to a distant place. Transport supplies to a distant place, and the populace will be impoverished.� The remark that �it is not beneficial to cross great rivers� in contention can also be read as a restatement of the basic principle of ethical contention that distinguishes it from invasive and aggressive action. In the chapter on �Terrain,� The Art of War says, �One advances without seeking glory, retreats without avoiding blame, only protecting people.� Similarly, the Taoist classic The Masters of Huainan says of adventurism, �Covetous people with many desires are lulled to sleep by power and profit, seduced into longing for fame and status. They wish to rise in the world through exceptional cunning, so their vitality and spirit are daily depleted and become further and further away.� The theme of �Contention� is further analyzed in the I Ching�s statements on each individual element of the hexagram. The first element shows lowliness and weakness. The statement of the text says, �When you do not persist forever in an affair, there is a little criticism, but the end is auspicious.� Cheng Yi explains, �This is because contention in general is not something that should be prolonged; and weak people in low positions in particular hardly ever have any luck in contention.� The Art of War also reflects this principle of minimalism in its strategy; in the chapter on �Doing Battle,� it says, �When you do battle, even if you are winning, if you continue for a long time it will dull your forces and blunt your edge; if you besiege a citadel, your strength will be exhausted. If you keep your armies out in the field for a long time, your supplies will be insufficient.� Cheng Yi�s observation that powerless people in positions of weakness rarely have luck in contention also illustrates one reason why peasant uprisings throughout Chinese history have generally had among their leaders
