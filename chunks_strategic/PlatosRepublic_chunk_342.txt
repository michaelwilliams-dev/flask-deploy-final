they can, in the service of the city as a whole and the rulers, defend against in? vaders. Within the city, they can side with the people, and hence the desires, against the rulers and reason, or they can side with the rulers, not against the people, but for the purpose of controlling and guiding them. The warriors are guided by general opinions, or rules, who e grounds they do not know and exceptions to which they cannot recognize. For example, they must detest men who do not appear to . care for the city, who love foreign things, who call the law into ques? tion. Most such men would indeed be vicious, but Socrates would also be among them. They would instinctively hate him and want to punish him as an enemy, for, in their lack of reason and identification of all good with the city's good, they would be unable to distinguish him from the others. The rulers might be able to make the necessary distinctions, and the warriors would most likely obey them; but one could foresee a situation in which the warriors rebelled against the rulers because the rulers broke the rules of morality they had inculcated in the warriors. But, at all events, from the point of view of the healthy city, perhaps men like Socrates should be repressed. In practice, spiritedness fre? quently rules over wisdom in cities, leading to crimes committed in the name of justice. Moral indignation led to the execution of the generals who were in command at the great Athenian victory of Arginusae, but who, because of a storm, were unable to satisfy the pious duty of recovering the corpses of their dead from the sea; this execution was carried out over the strenuous objections of the wise Socrates. Moreover, Socrates' own execution was a result of the same moral indignation. In both cases the general principle of the people was a valid one; but in both they failed to see the mitigating circumstances, not to say the moral superiority of the lawbreakers. Within the individual soul, spiritedness e,xpresses itself in similar ways. It can lead to the voracious conqueror or the proud protector of his own. It can also produce the ï¿½angry, petulant man who flies into a fury at what opposes his desires. And, most interesting of all, it can result in the morally indignant man who punishes his own desires as well as those of others. But in the case of the soul this punishment of offending desires is more harmful than in the city. The soul in which reason is most developed will-like Leontius' eyes-desire to see all kinds of things which the citizen is forbidden to see; it will abound with thoughts usually connected with selfishness, lust, and vice. Such a soul will be like that banished poetry which contained images of vice as well as of virtue. Spiritedness, in the form of anger and shame, will oppose reason's desiring. This is why the austere,
