different from knowledge or the same?" "Different." "Then opinion is dependent on one thing and knowledge on another, each according to its own power." "Thaf s so." "Doesn't knowledge naturally depend on what is, to know of what is that it is and how it is? However, in my opinion, ifs necessary to make this distinction first." "What distinction?" 476d e 477 a b 477 C d e 478 a "We will assert that powers are a certain class of beings by means of which we are capable of what we are capable, and also everything else is capable of whatever it is capable.- For example, I say sight and hearing are powers, if perchance you understand the form of which I wish to speak." "I do understand," he said. "Now listen to how they look to me. In a power I see no color or shape or anything of the sort such as I see in many other things to which I look when I distinguish one thing from another for myself. With a power I look only to this-on what it depends and what it ac? complishes; and it is on this basis that I come to call each of the powers a power; and that which depends on the same thing and accomplishes the same thing, I call the same power, and that which depends on something else and accomplishes somethingï¿½ else, I call a different power. What about you? What do you do?" "The same," he said. "Now, you best of men, come back here to knowledge again. Do you say it's some kind of power, or in what class do you put it?" "In this one," he said, "as the most vigorous of all powers." "And what about opinion? Is it among the powers, or shall we :refer it to some other form?" "Not at all," he said. "For that by which we are capable of opining is nothing other than opinion." _ "But just a little while ago you agreed that knowledge and opinion are not the same." "How," he said, "could any intelligent man count that which doesn't make mistakes the same as that which does?" "Fine," I said, "and we plainly agree that opinion is different from knowledge." "Yes, it is different." "Since each is capable of something different, are they, therefore, naturally dependent on different things?" "Necessarily." "Knowledge is presumably dependent on what is, to know of what is that it is and how it is?" "Yes.'" "While opinion, we say, opines." "Yes."" "The same thing that knowledge knows? And will the knowable and the opinable be the same? Or is that impossible?" "On the basis of what's been agreed to, it's impossible," he said. "If different powers are naturally dependent on different things and both are powers-,)pinion and knowledge-and each is, as we say, dif? ferent, then on this basis it's not admissible that the knowable and the opinable be the same." "If what is, is knowable, then wouldn't something
