natural, while the latter must provide aconventional support for natural differences whichmenhave reason towant toforget. This is why, inthesecond partofthe lie,agodmustbeinvoked. The lie,because itisalie,points uptheproblems itisdesigned to solve. Perhaps norational investigation ofthem could yield abasis for political legitimacy. Inanyevent, thecharacter ofmen's desires would make itimpossible forarational teaching tobethepublic teaching. Today itisgenerally admitted thatevery society isbased onmyths, myths which render acceptable theparticular form ofjustice in- corporated inthesystem. Socrates speaks more directly: themyths are lies.Assuch, they areunacceptable toarational man.Buthedoesnot hold thatbecause allcivil societies needmyths about justice, there isno rational basis tobefound forjustice. Histeaching cannot serve asan excuse foraccepting whatever asociety asserts isjustice. Thenoble lie isprecisely anattempt torationalize thejustice ofcivil society; itisan essential partofanattempt toelaborate aregime which mostembodies theprinciples ofnatural justice andhence transcends thefalse justice of other regimes. Thethoughtful observer willfindthatthenoble lieisa political expression oftruths which ititself leadshim toconsider. In other words, there aregood reasons forevery partofthis lie,andthat is why arational manwould bewilling totell it. TheSocratic teaching that agood society requires afundamental falsehood isthedirect opposite ofthatoftheEnlightenment which argued that civil society could dispense with liesandcount onselfish [367 ] THEREPUBLIC calculation tomakemen loyal toit.The difference between thetwo views canbereduced toadifference concerning theimportanceof moderation, both forthepreservation ofcivil society and forthe full development ofindividual men's natures. Thenoble lieisdesigned to givemengrounds forresisting, inthename ofthecommon good, their powerful desires. Thegreat thinkers oftheEnlightenment didnotdeny thatsuch liesarenecessary toinduce men tosacrifice their desires and tocare forthecommon good.They werenomore hopeful than Soc- rates concerning most men's natural capacity toovercome their inclinations anddevote themselves tothepublic welfare. What they in- sisted wasthat itwaspossible tobuild acivil society inwhichmendid nothave tocare forthecommon good, inwhich desire would bechan- neled rather than controlled. Acivil society which provided security andsome prospect ofeachman's acquiring those possessions hemost wishes would beboth amore simple andmore .sure solution thanany Utopian attempt tomakemenabandon their selfish wishes. Such acivil society could count onmen's rational adhesion, for itwould beanin- strument inprocuring theirowngood astheysee it.Therefore modera- tionoftheappetites would benotonlyunnecessary butundesirable, for itwould render amanmore independent oftheregime whose purpose itistosatisfy theappetites. TheSocratic response tothisargument would betwofold. First, hewould simply deny thepossibility ofaregime which would never be compelled tocallforrealsacrifices from itscitizens. This isparticularly true intimeofwar.Amancannot reasonably calculate thatdying in battle willserve thelong-range satisfaction ofhisdesires. Therefore every civil society willrequire myths which canmake citizens of private men.Butinthecaseofsuch aselfish society itwillbebothvery difficult toprovide suchmyths, andthey willbeadistasteful parody of thereason onwhich thesociety prides itself; what pretends tobe philosophy willhave tobepropaganda. Second, such acivil society canbefounded onlybychanging the meaning ofrationality. For this society, rationality consists inthe discovery ofthebestmeans ofsatisfying desires. The irrationality of those desires mustbeneglected; inparticular, menmust neglect the ir- rationality oftheir unwillingness toface thefact that theymust die,oftheir constant search forthemeans ofself-preservation asifthey could liveforever. Socrates teaches thatonly amanwhomasters the desires ofthebody canseethetruehuman situation andcome toterms with it.Suchmastery istheprecondition ofliving arational and satisfy- ing life,but itisvery difficult toattain, andmenneed allthehelpthey canget iftheyaretosucceed inattaining it.The civil society proposed [368 ] Interpretive Essay bythemen oftheEnlightenment, farfromencouraging suchmodera- tion, positively discourages it.Italsoridicules those sometimes simple beliefs which would help tosupport aman's self-restraint andremind himofhismortality. Such asociety would produce arace ofself- forgetting, philistine menwhowould demand astheir
