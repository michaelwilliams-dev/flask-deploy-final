preface to his edition, and the biography of Sun Tzu from the SHIH CHI, both translated above. Then come, firstly, Cheng Yu-hsien�s I SHUO,38 with author�s preface, and next, a short miscellany of historical and bibliographical information entitled SUN TZU HSU LU, compiled by Pi I-hsun. As regards the body of the work, each separate sentence is followed by a note on the text, if required, and then by the various commentaries apper- taining to it, arranged in chronological order. These we shall now proceed to discuss briefly, one by one. 1.3 The Commentators Sun Tzu can boast an exceptionally long distinguished roll of commentators, which would do honor to any classic. Ou-yang Hsiu remarks on this fact, though he wrote before the tale was complete, and rather ingeniously explains it by saying that the artifices of war, being inexhaustible, must therefore be susceptible of treatment in a great variety of ways. 1. TS�AO TS�AO or Ts�ao Kung, afterwards known as Wei Wu Ti [A.D. 155-220]. There is hardly any room for doubt that the earliest commentary on Sun Tzu actually came from the pen of this extraordinary man, whose biography in the SAN KUO CHIH reads like a romance. One of the greatest military geniuses that the world has seen, and Napoleonic in the scale of his operations, he was especially famed for the marvelous rapidity of his marches, which has found expression in the line "Talk of Ts�ao Ts�ao, and Ts�ao Ts�ao will appear." Ou- yang Hsiu says of him that he was a great captain who "measured his strength against Tung Cho, Lu Pu and the two Yuan, father and son, and vanquished 37See my "Catalogue of Chinese Books" (Luzac & Co., 1908), no. 40. 38This is a discussion of 29 difficult passages in Sun Tzu. CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 18 them all; whereupon he divided the Empire of Han with Wu and Shu, and made himself king. It is recorded that whenever a council of war was held by Wei on the eve of a far-reaching campaign, he had all his calculations ready; those generals who made use of them did not lose one battle in ten; those who ran counter to them in any particular saw their armies incontinently beaten and put to flight." Ts�ao Kung�s notes on Sun Tzu, models of austere brevity, are so thoroughly characteristic of the stern commander known to history, that it is hard indeed to conceive of them as the work of a mere LITTERATEUR. Sometimes, indeed, owing to extreme compression, they are scarcely intelligible and stand no less in need of a commentary than the text itself.39 2. MENG SHIH. The commentary which has come down to us under this name is comparatively meager, and nothing about the author is known. Even his per- sonal name has not been recorded. Chi T�ien-pao�s edition places him after Chia Lin,and Ch�ao Kung- wu also assigns him to the T�ang dynasty,40 but this is a mistake. In Sun Hsing-yen�s preface, he appears
