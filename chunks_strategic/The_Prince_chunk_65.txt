render the translation not simplistic , but real , au.thentic , and firsthand , so the reader also comes closer to Machiavelli rather than trying to bring Machiavelli closer to us . For the same rea.son, words as Prince, Principality, and Republic are capitalized to em.phasize their conceptual importance to Machiavelli . Such a literal translation brings the reader closer to the Italian , rather than trying to masticate and digest the Italian so as to make it sound as if Machiavelli had written the text in English . Further, this text does not advance footnotes , glossary, biography, historical references , bibliography, or other academic apparatus . All this can be readily at.tained from the encyclopedias and in the numerous tortuous educated and scholarly translations available from Harvard, Oxford , Cambridge and elsewhere. The text here is aimed at the common man with read.ability and plainness for those who simply want to read The Prince for what Machiavelli may have had to say about the human condition read President for Prince , or chicanery for virtue , or Establishment for Bloodline , or however you will . As to Machiavelli himself, he was a maverick, with an acute mind . He was acerbic , ironic , and double-edged . Nietzsche said that Machia. velli wrote with "a galloping rhythm,� that he had his tongue in his cheek sometimes , and that he dealt with change in the consciousness paradigm of the Renaissance when man began to think in new ways about himself and the world around him. The key to Machiavelli is his concept of � effective reality, � rather than idealized , philosophical , or � ethical reality. � His final plea to free Italy from the barbarian and to unite the land and people came true only later , in the 19th century, under Garibaldi ; but, it was the issue he was already speaking to . Personally, I may not always agree with Machiavelli -although almost always I respect his counsel. A ruler, he says , should never think 140� Niccol� Machiavelli or practice anything but war, weapons, and military exercises. Even a modern President has come far from this ancient and rudimentary phi.losophy, practicing diplomacy, administration, and civic virtues. For Machiavelli, a Prince scorns the gentle arts � yet even such as Freder.ick II of Sicily played the flute, danced, and cultivated the arts. Times may have changed; we may be, or almost, in a post-bellum world, if not a post military world. War may almost be old-fashioned. I would it were so. Machiavelli warned against such Pollyanna. And nations still maintain the military and defense posture as their number one option. Machiavelli is always the realist and almost always the clear thinker. The centerpiece of his philosophy is in Chapter XVII where he shows unequivocally that a successful Prince should prefer to be feared than loved. The text of The Prince is still as relevant today to social affairs as it was in 1532,
