that we know nothing about the soul, which denies the value of the argument, calling into question the teaching of the whole dialogue which was based on an understanding of the soul. This discus? sion then serves two purposes: to cause the unphilosophic man to be concerned about justice for fear of what will happen to him in another world, and to tum philosophic men to the study of the soul. The soul is the philosophic question, and it is his concern for this question that distinguishes Socrates from his predecessors; the most characteristic part of his teaching is that soul is irreducible and that it is somehow the principle of the cosmos. The shade of Achilles in Hades is offensive not only to good morals but to the possibility of philosophy, for Achilles seems to show that the human soul has no support in the cosmos. So? craticï¿½ thought combines the apparently contradictory concerns of earlier poetry and earlier philosophy; he can understand man and un? derstand nature, for the two are informed by the same principle, soul. The Republic, which seems to give a completed teaching about politics and the soul, ends with a return to philosophic doubt, to the conviction that one's opinions are open to unanswered, if not unanswerable, ques? tions. In one sense one can even say that the book has taught us nothing other than the necessity of philosophy and its priority and superiority to the political life. The myth of Er merely reiterates this message. According to this myth there is a rational cosmic order to which each individual's fate is attached. In the afterlife happiness and misery are distributed ac? cording to virtues and vices practiced during life. This encourages de? cent men to persist in their efforts to be virtuous; for if they succeed, a wonderful thousand-year voyage through the heavens awaits them. But the myth also makes clear that the civic virtues do not suffice for a man's salvation for all eternity, and that, unless he has philosophized on earth, this voyage will profit him nothing. For each man must choose a new life, and that new life will determine whether he will fare well or ill in his next thousand-year sojourn among the dead; the cor? rect choice of a life depends on knowledge of the sou], not on the prac? tice of moral virtue. Those who have been rewarded for moral virtue in the afterlife are less well prepared than are those who have been pun? ished to make the proper choice of life. We see a decent man, one like Cephalus, who has just come from his rewards choose a tyranfs life; for only Jaw and convention had kept him in bounds in his earlier life, and his real view of happiness led him to envy tyrants. He has learned nothing in the afterlife; there is apparently no philosophy in the after? life for those who did not practice it on earth; the soul is not perfec;:ted
