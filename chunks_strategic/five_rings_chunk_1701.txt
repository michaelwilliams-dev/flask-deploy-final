OBSERVANCES OFTHE LAW Observance I Pietro Aretino, sonofalowly shoemaker, hadcatapultedhimself into fame asawriter ofbitingsatires. But likeevery Renaissance artist, heneeded to find apatronwho would givehim acomfortable lifestylewhile notinter feringwith hiswork. In1528 Aretino decided toattemptanew strategyin thepatronage game. Leaving Rome, heestablished himself inVenice, where fewhad heard ofhim. Hehad afair amount ofmoneyhehad man- agedtosave, butlittle else. Soon after hemoved into his new home, how- ever, heflirewopenitsdoors torich andpoor, regalingthem with banquetsand amusements. Hebefriended each andevery gondolier, tip- pingthem royally.Inthestreets, hespreadhismoney liberally, giving it awaytobeggars, orphans,Washerwomen. Amongthecity’s commoners, word quickly spreadthat Aretino was more thanjustagreat writer, hewas aman ofpower—-akind oflord. Artists and men ofinfluence soon begantofrequentAreu‘no’s house. Within afew years hemade himself acelebrity;novisiting dignitary would think ofleaving Venice without payinghim acall. Hisgenerosityhad cost him most ofhissavings,buthadboughthim influence and agoodname— acornerstone inthefoundation ofpower.Since inRenaissance Italyas elsewhere theabilitytospend freelywas theprivilege oftherich, the arisv tocracy thought Aretino had tobe aman ofinfluence, since hespent money like one. And since theinfluence ofaman ofinfluence isworth buying,Aretino became therecipient ofallsorts ofgifts andmoneys. Dukes and duchesses, wealthy merchants, andpopesandprincescom- petedtogainhisfavor, and showered him with allkinds ofpresents. Aretino’s spending habits, ofcourse, were strategic,and thestrategy worked like acharm. Butforrealmoneyand comfort heneeded agreat patron’s bottomless pockets. Having surveyedthepossibilities,heeventu- allysethissightsontheextremely wealthy MarquisofMantua, and wrote anepic poemthat hededicated tothemarquis.This was acommonprac- ticeofwriters lookingforpatronage: Inexchangefor adedication they would getasmall stipend, enoughtowrite yetanotherpoem,sothatthey spenttheir lives inakind ofconstant servility. Aretino, however, wanted power,not ameasly wage.Hemight dedicate apoem tothemarquis,but hewould offer ittohim asagift,implying bydoingsothat hewas not a hired hack lookingfor astipendbutthat heand themarquiswere equals. Aret.ino’s gift-givingdid notstop there: As aclose friend oftwo of Venice’s greatest artists, thesculptor JacopoSansovino and thepainter Titian, heconvinced these men toparticipateinhisgift-giving scheme. Aretino had studied themarquisbefore goingtowork onhim, and knew histaste inside and out; he was able toadvise Sansovirio and Titian what subject matter would pleasethemarquismost. When hethen sent aSanso- vino sculptureand aTitian paintingtothemarquisasgiftsfrom allthree of them, the man was beside himself withjoy. Over the next fewmonths, Aretino sent other gifts——swords, saddles, theglassthat was aVenetian specialty, things heknew themarquis prized. Soon he,Titian, and Sansovino began toreceive gifts from themarquisin return. And thestrategy went further: When the son-in—law ofafriend of Aretino’s found himself injailinMantua, Aretino was able togetthe mar- quistoarrange hisrelease. Aretinds friend, awealthy merchant, was a man ofgreatinfluence inVenice; byturningthegoodwillhehad builtupyour: pussrrrl byafter {hispromlxe, and Pharaoh, (loomed
