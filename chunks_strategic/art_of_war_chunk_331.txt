are honest and decent even though ambitious, polite even when favored, strong though yielding, flexible yet firm, this is the way to thrive. If you travel the path to stagnation, even heaven and earth cannot make you flourish. If you practice the way to thrive, even heaven and earth cannot make you perish. An ancient Taoist saying goes, �My fate depends on me, not on Heaven.� Strategists did not believe in predestination and did not encourage people to consult fortune-telling books and hope for the best. They taught people to examine their own situations and their own actions, and to take conscious responsibility for their own behavior and its consequences. [ 23 ] Justice in Commanders Commanders must be just; if they are not just, they will lack dignity. If they lack dignity, they will lack charisma; and if they lack charisma, their soldiers will not face death for them. Therefore justice is the head of warriorship. Justice also means duty. Commanders who are not just and do not command justice lack dignity because those under their command will not fear to be unruly. Commanders must be humane; if they are not humane, their forces will not be effective. If their forces are not effective, they will not achieve anything. Therefore humaneness is the gut of warriorship. If commanders are not humane, their forces will not be effective because there will be no bond of loyalty between them. The troops of a leader who is not humane will lack motivation to fight loyally for the cause. Commanders must have integrity; without integrity, they have no power. If they have no power, they cannot bring out the best in their armies. Therefore integrity is the hand of warriorship. Without integrity, commanders have no power because they do not back up their words with their deeds and therefore cannot inspire confidence and trust. Commanders must be trustworthy; if they are not trustworthy, their orders will not be carried out. If their orders are not carried out, then forces will not be unified. If the armed forces are not unified, they will not be successful. Therefore trustworthiness is the foot of warriorship. Trustworthiness cements the relationship of commander and forces, letting the forces know they can expect to be rewarded for doing well and punished for cowardice or unruliness. Commanders must be superior in intelligence; if they are not superior in intelligence, . . . their forces lack [resolution]. Therefore resolution is the tail of warriorship. Resolution derives from intelligence through the repose of confidence in an intelligent plan of action. [ 24 ] Effectiveness in Commanders This chapter is all in fragments. The next five chapters have some lacunae, but they are largely descriptive and self-explanatory. They need no elucidation, but will nevertheless yield more to reflection. [ 25 ] Failings in Commanders These are failings in commanders: 1. They consider themselves capable of what they are unable to do. 2. They are arrogant. 3. They are ambitious for rank. 4. They
