asubject ofcontroversy. This isanother case where anattempt tofollow Plato's useoftheword from itscasual common- sensemeaning toitshighest theoretical meaning isaprecondition oflearning, because thathighest sense isonlyadistillation ofwhat isimplied inthecasual useoftheword. Etymologically, eidos isderived from theverb "tosee"andmeans, inthe firstinstance, "theappearance ofathing"—how itlooks, thevisible charac- teristics that distinguish itfrom everything else. Inthepresent passage, it means "asortofthing," a"class"; theconnection ofthissense with theformer one isobvious. Thewordform willbereserved foreidos throughout this translation. 2.TheGreek word isdoxa derived from thewordmeaning "toseem." This istheclassic word for"opinion," asopposed to"knowledge." Itssense is sometimes extended tomean "reputation"; fordoxameans what ispopularly heldand isbased upon theappearance orseeming ofthings, asopposed to their reality. Hence, although "opinion" and"reputation" arenotpejorative terms inthemselves, their relation tomere seeming callsthem intoquestion; Plato constantly playsupon thisambiguity. Inthiscontext Glaucon andAdei- mantus insistonthedistinction between opinion orseeming andbeing, andbe- tween thefewwhoarecapable offreeing themselves fromopinion andthemany who arenot. 3.TheGreek word for"law" isnomos. Itcanalsobetranslated a«;"con- vention." (Alaw isnotnecessarily what ispassed byanassembly; itcanbean ancestral practice which governs agroup ofmen. Inthissensenomos canbe understood astheopposite ofphysis, "nature.") raa6 1 Notes /Book II 4.Glaucon's account ofthisstory should becompared with Heirddotus' {History,!, 8-13). j/SM 5.Paraphrased fromSeven Against Thebes (592).Theman itdescribes wishes tobe"best." 6.Seven Against Thebes, 593-594. 7.Literally: "Let abrother stand byaman." 8.Works andDays, 232-234. 9.Odyssey, XIX, 109-113. After thesecond lineAdeimantus drops the following line:"Lording overmany strong men." Line114reads: "All asa result ofhisgood leadership; andthepeople prosper (live invirtue) under him." 10.Musaeus isasemimythical singer andseerfrom theheroic times. Hispoetry issaid tohave dealt with cosmological themes. He issometimes alleged tohavebeen thesonofOrpheus. Byhisson,Adeimantus maymean Eumolpus, who,among other things, wasreputed tohave instituted theEleu- sinian Mysteries, oneofthecentral Athenian religious observances. Hisde- scendants were theEleusinian priests. Ifitisindeed Eiunolpus who ismeant, Adeimantus isimplicitly criticizing the official Athenian understanding of thefuture life. Asymposium isliterally a"drinking party," andaPlatonic presentation ofsuch agathering istobefound intheSymposium. 11.The expression forprose iscomposed from words meaning "to speak privately" andcould alsomean what onesays inprivate. Almost all public speech waswritten inverse, andHerodotus (443 b.c.) isthe firstprose writer anyofwhose workswepossess intheir entirety. The factthatpoetry by nature isaddressed tomen inlarge groups isanessential element inPlato's analysis ofit.Prose hasanaturalness andfrankness connected with itsprivate character, and thisshould provide abasis forreflection onPlato's choice of prose forthepresentation ofhisown thought. 12.Hesiod, Works andDays, 287—289. Adeimantus seems tohave substituted theword smooth forshort (cf.328b-d). InHesiod's text"gods" is qualified by"deathless." 13.Homer, Iliad, IX,497—501. Adeimantus substitutes "canbemoved byprayer" for"canbeturned," andheleaves outthelinefollowing the firstin theoriginal: "And they aresurely greater invirtue, honor, andstrength." 14.TheGreek forinitiation, telete, means a"making perfect" and is very close totheword Adeimantus hasjustused fordeath, teleiite. 15.Thequote isattributed toSimonides. 16.Ashadow painting isarough sketch designed toproduce aneffect at adistance. Perhaps Adeimantus means perspective drawing which gives an impression ofdepth onatwo-dimensional surface.

Apparently thefoxepitomized cunning and subtle deception inhisworks. 18.Most manuscripts read logoi, "speeches," rather than nomoi, "laws," butthemanuscript reading "laws" isregarded asanexcellent one; I [447 ] THEREPUBLIC followBumet inchoosing "laws" onthegrounds ofitsintrinsic plausibility. At 366bAdeimantus recapitulates thisargument and asserts that itisthecities (instead ofthelaws) andthepoetswho tellusofthedeliverances from the wrath ofthegods. Ifcities tellanything, itisbytheir laws,"Laws" inthis passage isjustasubstitute for"cities." Adeimantus undoubtedly refers to parts oftheAthenian religious observance. Nomoi,
