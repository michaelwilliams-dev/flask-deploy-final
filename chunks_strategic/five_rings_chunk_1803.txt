CONCERNING THE MILITIA AND MERCENERY SOLDIERSWe outurehavetoandstarttalkedwewithsawofandhowthedifferentthetowincausesandPrincipalitiesoflosetheirsuchsuccessstates.whichorNowIfail-set weturn tothegood andbadpoints ofsuch states, andhow they occur. Wementioned how aPrince should have certain basic goods inplace; otherwise, hecomes toruin. Themain fundamen- talsthatastate— new, old,ormixed —hastohave aregood laws andastrong army. Good laws donotcome without strong security; where thearmy isstrong, oneneeds good laws. Leaving thequestion ofgood laws aside, let'sdiscuss armies. Theforces aPrince uses todefend hisstate areeither hisown, ortheyaremercenaries, auxiliaries, ormixed forces. Mercenaries andauxiliaries areuseless anddangerous. Astate based onmer- cenary forces willnever besolid orsecure. Mercenary forces are notunited; they areambitious, undisciplined, anddisloyal. They arecareful offriends, villainous with enemies, notfearing God, andfaithless among men. Attack anddefeat arethesame tothem. Inpeacetime, theyrobyou. Inwar, theenemy ruins you. Therea- sonisthatnothing keeps them incamp except amiserable wage, notenough forthem todieforyou. They want tobesoldiers as long asthere isnowar, butwhen warcomes, they fleeandrun away. This does nottake much convincing because theruinofItaly isnotfrom anything butbeing inthehands, formany years, of mercenary troops. Left alone they made some advances, butas soon asforeigners came, they showed their true colors. When Charles ofFrance showed upthey called itthe"war ofchalk" — because white chalk marked thehouses where hecould lodge his troops. He,who said, likeGiovanni Savonarola, thatdefeat was 76— Niccolò Machiavelli duetoourfault andsins, wastelling itright. Butitwasn't those sins, buttheones thatIrelate. And because thePrinces sentthe mercenaries, they suffered theconsequences. I'dlike toshow even better theweakness ofsuch armies. Mercenary captains areeither excellent soldiers, ornot.Ifthey are,youcan't trust them because they aspire toglory themselves —either byputting youdown, orputting others down thatyou don’t intend toharm. Ifthey arenogood assoldiers, they ruin youanyway. Ifsomeone answers thishappens nomatter who the soldier is,Ihave toanswer thatthere isadifference inhow ar- mies work under Princes orinRepublics. ThePrince must behis own captain; inaRepublic, oneofthecitizens assumes thecap- taincy. When heisnotavaliant man, hehastobereplaced. When heisvaliant, itishard tocontain himwithin thelaw. Butfrom experience, onesees Princes andRepublican armies make pro- gress, Mercenaries donothing butdamage. Anarmed Republic falls toitsown dictator from within less easily than anarmy raised from outside. Rome andSparta lasted many centuries armed andfree. The Swiss arearmed andfree. Mercenary armies ofantiquity are,for example, theCarthaginians who were oppressed bytheir own mercenaries after thefirst Punic campaign against Rome (241 B.C.), when they stillhadtheir own captains. Philip ofMace- donia (father ofAlexander theGreat), after thedeath ofEpami- nonda, wasmade captain ofthearmies bytheThebans and, after their victory, took their liberty from them. Thepeople ofMilan, after Duke Philip's death, made Francesco Sforza their captain against theVenetians. After defeating theVenetians atCaravag- gio,hejoined with them toputdown hispatrons inMilan and take over. Hisfather, asoldier forQueen GioofNaples, aban- doned herunarmed,
