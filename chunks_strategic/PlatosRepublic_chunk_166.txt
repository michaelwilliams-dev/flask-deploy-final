said. "It hasn't," I said, "turned out to have been very wise of me to have left aside previously the unpleasantness about the possession of women, nor to have left aside procreation, as well as the institution of the rulers either. I did so because I knew that the wholly and com? pletely true institution is a thing both likely to arouse resentment and hard to bring into being. But, as it was, the necessity of going through c. these things nonetheless arose.Well, what particularly concerns women and children has been completed, but what concerns the rulers must be pursued as it were from the beginning. We were saying, if you re- 03 a member, that they must show themselves to be lovers of the city, tested in pleasures and pains, and that they must show that they don't cast out this conviction in labors or fears or any other reverse. The man who's unable to be so must be rejected, while the one who emerges altogether pure, like gold tested in fire, must be set up as ruler and be given gifts and prizes both when he is alive and after he has died. These were the kinds of things that were being said as the b argument, covering its face, sneaked by, for fear of setting in motion what now confronts us." "What you say is quite true," he said. "I do remember." "My friend, I shrank from saying what has now been dared ï¿½ ri'f- Book VI I 502b-504a SOCRATES/ADEIMANTUS anyhow," I said. "And let's now dare to say this: philosophers must be established as the most precise29 guardians." "Yes, let it be said," he said. "Then bear in mind that you'll probably have but a few.

"You know that natures that are good at learning, have memories, are shrewd and quick and everything else that goes along with these qualities, and are as well full of youthful fire and magnificence-such natures don't willingly grow together with understandings that choose orderly lives which are quiet and steady. Rather the men who possess them are carried away by their quickness wherever chance leads and all steadiness goes out from them." "What you say is true," he said. "And, on the other hand, those steady, not easily changeable dispositions, which one would be inclined to count on as trustworthy and which in war are hard to move in the face of fears, act the same way in the face of studies. They are hard to move and hard to teach, as if they had become numb;30 and they are filled with sleep and yawn? ing when they must work through anything of the sort." "That's so," he said.
