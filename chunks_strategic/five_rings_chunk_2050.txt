Itisusually applied tochroniclers andhistorians, oratAthens to thosewhowrite speeches fortheuseofothers incourt. 38.Theword islexis,which canalsomean simply "aspeech" but fre- quently means "manner orstyle ofspeech" or"diction inpoetry." Theword is related tologos. 39.Socrates doesnotmention thevery firstthings intheIliad (I,1—11), theinvocation tothegoddess andHomer's claim thatshe tellsthestory. Soc- rates treats thepoem asafabrication ofHomer, asnothaving adivine origin. He isthus able toblame Homer without impiety. Homer becomes anin- novator instead ofaspokesman ofthegods. Socrates' intention isakin tothat ofcertain schools ofBiblical criticism. 40.

Forasomewhat different evaluation oferos, theSymposium andthePhae- drusshould beconsulted. 44.Theword, translated here as"harmonic mode," and inwhat suc- ceeds assimply "mode," isharmonia. "Rhythm" andharmonia aredefined as follows inLaws, 664e: "...rhythm isthename given totheorder ofthemo- tion,while, asforsound, themixture ofhighandlowwould receive thename harmonia." Aharmonia issimply ascale, andthevarious scales constitute the different modes Socrates speaks of.Itssimplest sense isthatimplied inthe present context—theuseofvariations ofpitch inspeaking. Rhythm applies both tomusic andwords and isequivalent tothemeter andtheaccentuation ofmusic following upon it. 45.Theword isthemis, which is"law" or"right," but ithasacertain di- vineconnotation lacking intheword nomos. 46.C£363c, note 10. 47.There areseveral myths about thesatyrMarsyas andtheflute.The story apparently referred tohere istheoneconcerning thecontest between Apollo andMarsyas, theformer playing thecither andthelatter theflute.The Muses judged Apollo thewinner.

This isshown bytheway inwhich headdresses himself toGlaucon, whoknows itallbutforwhom thetechnical knowledge hasnovisible relation to anyhuman orpolitical experience. 49.Damon isSocrates' musical authority.
