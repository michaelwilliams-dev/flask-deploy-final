Observance IV In1538, with thedeath ofhismother, Helena, theeight-year-oldfuture czar Ivan IV(orIvan theTerrible) ofRussia became anorphan.For the next fiveyearshewatched astheprincely class, theboyars,terrorized the country.Now and then, tomock theyoung Ivan, they would make him wear acrown and scepterandplace him onthethrone. VVhen thelittle boy'sfeetdangledover theedge ofthechair, theywould laughandlifthim offit,handing him from man toman intheair,making him feel hishelp lessness comparedtothem. When Ivan wasthirteen, heboldlymurdered theboyar leader and as- cended tothethrone. Forthenext few decades hestruggled tosubdue the boyars’ power,buttheycontinued todefyhim.By1575 hisefforts totrans- form Russia and defeat itsenemies had exhausted him. Meanwhile, his subjectswere complaining bitterlyabout hisendless wars, hissecret police, theunvanquishedandoppressive boyars.His own ministers begantoques- tion his moves. Finallyhehad hadenough.In1564 hehadtemporarily abandoned thethrone, forcing hissubjectstocallhim back topower.Now hetook thestrategyastepfurther, and abdicated. Totake hisplaceIvan elevated ageneral ofhis,Simeon Bekbulatovich, tothethrone. Butalthough Simeon hadrecentlyconverted toChristianity, hewasbybirth aTartar, and hisenthronement was aninsult toIvan’s sub- jects, since Russians looked down ontheTartars asinferiors and infidels. YetIvan ordered that allRussians, including theboyars, pledge obedience totheir new ruler. And while Simeon moved into theKremlin, Ivan lived inahumble house onMoscow’s outskirts, from which hewould sometimes \n‘sit thepalace,bow before thethrone, sitamong theother boyars, and humbly petitionSimeon forfavors. Over time itbecame clear that Simeon was akind ofkingsdouble. He dressed likeIvan, and acted likeIvan, buthehad norealpower,since no onewould really obey him. Theboyarsatthecourt who were oldenough toremember tauntingIvan when he was aboy, byplacinghim onthe throne, saw the connection: Theyhad made Ivan feel like aweakpre- tender, sonow hemirrored them byplacingaweak pretenderofhis own onthethrone. For twolong yearsIvan held themirror ofSimeonuptotheRussian people.The mirror said: Your whiningand disobedience have made me a czar with noreal power,soIwill reflect back toyouaczar with noreal power. You have treated medisrespectfully,soIwill dothe same toyou, making Russia thelaughingstockoftheworld. In1577, inthe name ofthe Russian people,thechastisedboyarsonce again beggedIvan toreturn to thethrone, which hedid. Helived asczar until hisdeath, in1584, and the conspiracies, complaining,and second—guessing disappeared alongwith Simeon. Interpretation In1564,afterthreateningtoabdicate, Ivan had been grantedabsolutepow- ers.But thesepowershadslowlybeen chipped awayaseverysector ofso- ciety—the boyars,thechurch, thegovernment—viedfor more control. Foreignwars had exhausted thecountry,internal bickeringhadincreased, andIvan’s attemptstorespondhad been met with scorn. Russia had turned into akind ofboisterous classroom inwhich thepupils laughed openlyat theteacher. Ifheraised hisvoice orcomplained,heonlymet more resis- tance. Hehad toteach them alesson, give them ataste oftheir own medi- cine. Simeon Bekbulatovich was themirror heused todo so. After twoyearsinwhich thethrone had been anobjectofridicule and disgust,theRussian people learned their lesson. Theywanted their czar back, concedingtohim allthedignity andrespectthat thepositionshould alwayshave commanded. For the rest ofhisreign, Russia and Ivan got along fine.
