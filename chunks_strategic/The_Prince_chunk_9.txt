combine into any form of permanent fed.eration of themselves, and that their unity would have to be im.posed on them by some overpowering authority. Having re.marked the ease with which the more successful tyrants had carved out states for themselves in the past, he conceived the bold idea that, if there was indeed any way of forcing an unwilling It.aly into unity, it could only be by the compulsion of a super- who in the tyrant would conquer every state turn and subject whole country to his own absolute domination. For the purpose of freeing Italy from the disturbance of for.eign invaders, he considered it essential that one of con- the queror�s first cares should be to create a local militia or citizen it, army in each state as he conquered so that ultimately there would be so powerful a national army that no foreigner would any longer dare to attempt invasion. Although Machiavelli nowhere definitely stated what perma.nent form of government his tyrant should establish when once he had united the whole of Italy, it is evident from his Discourses upon the First Decade of Livy that he considered the Roman Re.public to have been most satisfactory constitution that had the been evolved in the past, and it may be gathered from certain pas-of sages in that work that his ideal the most practical form of government closely approximated to what we should now call a Constitutional Monarchy, but with an elected instead of a heredi.tary king. It is important to realize that, in writing The Prince, Machia THE PRINCE � 19 velli was working out the details of one part of his general scheme for the reorganization of Italy, and that he was only deal.ing with the transitional period while the tyrant would be gradu.ally acquiring dominion over the country; he was considering the difficulties that would be met with, and how they could be over.come. His view was that the conqueror would have to be a man of iron will, prepared to devote his life to the one object in view, and absolutely indifferent to the morality of his methods, to the interests of individuals, or to the temporary sufferings of the na.tion, provided he could achieve his purpose. In this book, then, Machiavelli boldly advocated those princi.ples of conduct by which alone he believed that it would be pos.sible for his super-tyrant to dominate Italy. He was not concerned with the morality of the prince's behavior; he was making a scien.tific exposition of the methods by which a certain object might be attained. He was not endeavoring to expound how a perfect state should be ideally governed; he was showing how very imperfect states, and especially newly created states, were in fact success.fully governed. And lastly, he was not putting forward a scheme of for permanent government a settled state, but merely stating the methods that should be employed by his tyrant to keep the re.cently conquered territories under control until he should have completed the
