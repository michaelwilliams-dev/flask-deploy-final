where your back is against the wall and you have to fight like hell to get out alive. PART II ORGANIZATIONAL (TEAM) WARFARE 5 AVOID THE SNARES OF GROUPTHINK: THE COMMAND-AND- CONTROL STRATEGY The problem in leading any group is that people inevitably have their own agendas. You have to create a chain of command in which they do not feel constrained by your influence yet follow your lead. Create a sense of participation, but do not fall into groupthink -- the irrationality of collective decision making. 6 SEGMENT YOUR FORCES: THE CONTROLLED-CHAOS STRATEGY The critical elements in war are speed and adaptability -- the ability to move and make decisions faster than the enemy. Break your forces into independent groups that can operate on their own. Make your forces elusive and unstoppable by infusing them with the spirit of the campaign, giving them a mission to accomplish, and then letting them run. 7 TRANSFORM YOUR WAR INTO A CRUSADE: MORALE STRATEGIES The secret to motivating people and maintaining their morale is to get them to think less about themselves and more about the group. Involve them in a cause, a crusade against a hated enemy. Make them see their survival as tied to the success of the army as a whole. PART III DEFENSIVE WARFARE 8 PICK YOUR BATTLES CAREFULLY: THE PERFECT-ECONOMY STRATEGY We all have limitations -- our energies and skills will take us only so far. You must know your limits and pick your battles carefully. Consider the hidden costs of a war: time lost, political goodwill squandered, an embittered enemy bent on revenge. Sometimes it is better to wait, to undermine your enemies covertly rather than hitting them straight on. 9 TURN THE TABLES: THE COUNTERATTACK STRATEGY Moving first -- initiating the attack -- will often put you at a disadvantage: You are exposing your strategy and limiting your options. Instead, discover the power of holding back and letting the other side move first, giving you the flexibility to counterattack from any angle. If your opponents are aggressive, bait them into a rash attack that will leave them in a weak position. 10 CREATE A THREATENING PRESENCE: DETERRENCE STRATEGIES The best way to fight off aggressors is to keep them from attacking you in the first place. Build up a reputation: You're a little crazy. Fighting you is not worth it. Uncertainty is sometimes better than overt threat: If your opponents are never sure what messing with you will cost, they will not want to find out. 11 TRADE SPACE FOR TIME: THE NONENGAGEMENT STRATEGY Retreat in the face of a strong enemy is a sign not of weakness but of strength. By resisting the temptation to respond to an aggressor, you buy yourself valuable time -- time to recover, to think, to gain perspective. Sometimes you can accomplish most by doing nothing. PART IV OFFENSIVE WARFARE 12 LOSE BATTLES BUT WIN THE WAR: GRAND STRATEGY Grand strategy is the art of looking beyond the battle
