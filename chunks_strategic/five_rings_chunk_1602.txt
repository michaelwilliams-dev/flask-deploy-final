Aristotle responded bysuggestingthat hetake Callisthenes,afor- mer pupil ofAristotle’s and apromising philosopherinhis own right, alongonthenext campaign. Aristotle had schooled Callisthenes intheskills ofbeingacourtier, but theyoungman secretly scoffed atthem. Hebelieved inpure philosophy,in Imadorned words, inspeakingthenaked truth. IfAlexander loved learning somuch, Callisthenes thought, hecould notobjecttoone who spoke his mind. DuringoneofAlexander’s major campaigns,Callisthenes spokehis mind one toomanytimes andAlexander had himputtodeath.

Scene II BeginningintheHan Dynasty two thousand years ago, Chinese scholars compiledaseries ofwritingscalled the27Histories, anofficial biography of each dynasty, including stories, statistics, census figures, and war chroni- cles. Each historyalso contained achaptercalled “Unusual Events,” and here, amongthelistings ofearthquakesandfloods, there would sometimes suddenly appear descriptions ofsuch bizarre manifestations astwo—headed sheep, geese flying backward, stars suddenly appearingindifferent parts of thesky,and soon.Theearthquakescould behistorically verified, butthe monsters and weird natural phenomenawere clearlyinserted onpurpose, andinvariably occurred inclusters. What could this mean? The Chineseemperorwas considered more than aman—he was a force ofnature. Hiskingdomwas the center oftheuniverse, and every- thing revolved around him. Heembodied theworld’s perfection.Tocriti- cizehim oranyofhisactions would have been tocriticize thedivine order. Nominister orcourtier dared approachtheemperor with even theslightest cautionaryword. Butemperorswere fallihle and thekingdomsuffered greatly bytheir mistakes. Inserting sightings ofstrange phenomenainto the court chronicles was theonly waytowarn them. Theemperorwould read ofgeese flyingbackward and moons outoforbit, and realize that he was beingcautioned. His actions were unbalancingtheuniverse and needed to change. interpretation ForChinese courtiers, theproblem ofhow togive theemperoradvice was animportantissue. Over theyears,thousands ofthem had died trying to warn orcounsel their master. Tobemade safely,their criticisms had tobe indirect--yet iftheywere tonindirect theywould not beheeded. The chronicles were their solution: Identifynoonepersonasthe source ofcriti« cism, make theadvice asimpersonalaspossible,butlettheemperorknow thegravity ofthesituation. Your master isnolonger the center oftheuniverse, buthestillimag- inesthateverythingrevolves around him. Whenyoucriticize him he sees theperson criticizing,not thecriticism itself. Like theChinese courtiers, youmust find awaytodisappearbehind thewarning. Usesymbols and other indirect methods topaintapicture oftheproblemstocome, without putting your neck ontheline.
