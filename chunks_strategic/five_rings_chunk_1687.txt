The city—statesofGreece had recently fought off amightyinvasion from Persia, and now Pausanias, along with allied shipsfrom Athens, had orders topunish theinvaders and win back the islands and coastal towns that the Persians had occupied. Both theAthenians and theSpartanshad great respectforPausanias-—he had proven himself asafearless warrior, with aflair forthedramatic. With amazing speed, Pausanias and histroops took Cyprus, then moved ontothemainland ofAsia Minor known astheHellespontand captured Byzantium {modem-day Istanbul). Now master ofpart ofthePer- sianempire,Pausanias begantoshow signsofbehavior that went beyond hisnormal flarnboyance.Heappearedinpublic wearing pomadesinhis hair andflowing Persian robes, andaccompanied byabodyguard ofEgyp- tians. Heheld lavish banquets inwhich hesatinthePersian manner and demanded tobeentertained. Hestopped seeing hisoldfriends, entered into communication with the Persian King Xerxes, and allinallaffected thestyle and manner ofaPersian dictator. Clearly powerand success had gone toPausanias’s head. Hisarmy- Athenians andSpartans alike—at firstthoughtthis apassing fancy:Hehad always been abitexaggerated inhisgestures. But when heilaunted hisdis- dain fortheGreeks’ simple wayoflife, and insulted the common Greek soldier, they begantofeel hehadgone toofar.Although there was nocon’ crete evidence forthis, rumors spreadthat hehadgoneover totheother side, and that hedreamed ofbecomingakind ofGreek Xerxes. Toquell thepossibility ofmutiny,theSpartansrelieved Pausanias ofhiscommand and called him home. Pausanias, however, continued todress inthe Persian style,even in Sparta.After afewmonths beindependentlyhired atrireme and returned totheHellespont, tellinghiscompatriots hewasgoingtocontinue theFight against thePersians. Actually, however, hehad differentplans———tomake himself ruler ofallGreece, with theaidofXerxes himself. The Spartans declared him apublic enemyand sent ashiptoCapturehim. Pausanias sur- rendered, certainlthat hecould clear himself ofthecharges oftreason. It did come outduringthetrial thatduringhisreignascommander hehad offended hisfellow Greeks time and again, erecting monuments, forin- stance, inhisown name, rather than inthose ofthecities whose troopshad fought alongside him, aswas the custom. YetPausanias proved right:De~ spite theevidence ofhis numerous contacts with theenemy, theSpartans refused toimprisonaman ofsuch noble birth, and lethimgo. Now thinking himself untouchable, Pausanias hired amessengerto take aletter toXerxes, butthe messenger instead took theletter tothe Spartan authorities. These men wanted tofind out more, sotheyhad the messenger arrangetomeet Pausanias inatemple where theycould hide and listen behind apartition. l/Vhat Pausanias said shocked them»-they had never heard such contemptfortheirways spokensobrazenly byone oftheir 0wn—-—and they made arrangementsforhisimmediate arrest. Onhiswayhome from thetemple, Pausanias gotword
