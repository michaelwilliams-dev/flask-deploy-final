The issues of thedaywere theunification ofthemanystates (including Prussia) into which Germanywas then divided, and awaragainst Austria, thepowerful neighbor tothesouth thathopedtokeeptheGermans weak and atodds, even threateningtointervene iftheytried tounite. Prince William, next in line tobeP:ussia’s king,was infavor ofgoingtowar, and theparliament rallied tothe cause, preparedtobackanymobilization oftroops.Theonly ones toopposewar were thepresent king,Frederick William IV, and his ministers, whopreferredtoappeasethepowerfulAustrians. Throughouthis career, Bismarck had been aloyal,even passionate supporter ofPrussian mightandpower.Hedreamed ofGerman unifica- tion, ofgoingtowaragainstAustria andhumiliatingthecountrythatfor so longhadkept Germanydivided. Aformer soldier, hesaw warfare asaglo- rious business. This, after all, was the man whoyearslater wouldsay,“The great questions ofthetime will bedecided, notbyspeechesandresolutions, but byiron andblood.” Passionate patriotand lover ofmilitary glory,Bismarck nevertheless gaveaspeechinparliamentattheheight ofthe war fever that astonished allwho heard it“Woe unto thestatesman,” hesaid, “who makes war with- out areason thatwill stillbevalid when the war isover! After thewar, you will alllookdifferentlyatthese questions.Willyouthen have thecourage toturn tothepeasant contemplating theashes ofhisfarm, tothe man who has been crippled,tothefather who has lost hischildren?” Notonly did Bismarckgoontotalk ofthemadness ofthis war, but, strangest ofall,he praisedAustria and defended her actions. This went against everythinghe had stood for. Theconsequenceswere immediate. Bismarck wasagainst the wa.r——what could thispossiblymean? Other deputieswere confused, and several ofthem changed their votes. Eventuallythekingand hisminis- ters won out, and war was averted. Afew weeks after Bisma.rck’s infamous speech,theking, gratefulthat LAW 3 19 20 LAW 3hehadspoken forpeace, made him acabinet minister. Afewyearslater he became thePrussian premier. Inthisrole heeventuallyledhiscountry and a.peace-loving kinginto awaragainst Austria, crushingtheformer empire andestablishinga German state, with Prussia atitshead. lnterpretation Atthe time ofhisspeechin1850, Bismarck made several calculations. First, hesensed that thePrussian military, which had notkept pace with other European armies, wasunready forwar--that Austria, infact,might verywell win, adisastrous result forthefuture. Second, ifthe war were lost and Bismarck hadsupported it,his career would begravely jeopardized. Thekingand hisconservative ministers wantedpeace;Bismarck wanted power.The answer was tothrow peopleoffthescent bysupportingacause hecletested, saying thingshewould laughatifsaidbyanother. Awhole countrywasfooled. Itwas because ofBismarck’s speechthat theking made him aminister, atposition from which hequicklyrose tobeprime minister, attaining thepowertostrengthen the Prussian militaryand accomplish what hehad wanted allalong:thehumiliation ofAustria and theunifica» tion ofGermanyunder Prussia’s leadership. Bismarck wascertainlyoneofthecleverest statesman who ever lived, amaster ofstrategyanddeception.No onesuspected what hewasuptoin this case.
