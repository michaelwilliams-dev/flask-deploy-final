void of power, you feign the appearance of fullness in such a way the enemies cannot tell how empty or powerful you really are. Then they will be hesitant to engage you in battle, and you can keep your forces intact. The rule is �When opponents are unwilling to fight with you, it is because they think it is contrary to their interests, or because you have misled them into thinking so� (Sun Tzu, The Art of War, �Emptiness and Fullness,� Liu Ji�s own paraphrase). During the era of the Three Kingdoms, when Zhuge Liang, general of the kingdom of Shu, was stationed at one of the most critical strategic passes on the border of the kingdom of Wei, he was left alone to guard the fortress with ten thousand troops when the other Shu generals went south with their armies. Now Sima Yi, general of the kingdom of Wei, led twenty thousand troops to attack Zhuge Liang. When they reached a point some twenty miles from the Shu outpost, Sima Yi sent scouts to reconnoiter.

So he led his troops back up into the mountains to the north. The next day at mealtime, Zhuge Liang was laughing with his assistants, saying, �No doubt Sima Yi thought I was only feigning weakness and must have had ambushers hidden, so he ran off through the mountains!� Battling with the Full Liu Ji said: In warfare, if your opponents are full of power, be well prepared and they will not readily make any moves. The rule is �When they are fulfilled, be prepared against them� (Sun Tzu, The Art of War, �Strategic Assessments�). In the early days of the era of the Three Kingdoms, when the first ruler of the kingdom of Shu originally established himself as a local king of a part of the region of Shu, he appointed a formidable warrior as forward general, handing him a ceremonial axe of authority. The same year the forward general garrisoned an army on the border of the kingdom of Wu; he also led a siege
