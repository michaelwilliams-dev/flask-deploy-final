Sun The next best is to attack alliances. LI QUAN This means attacking when alliance are first established. CHEN HAO Some say this means that when the enemy has already mobilized and is negotiating, strike and overcome them�this is next best. MENG SHI If you carry on alliances with strong countries, your enemies won�t dare to plot against you. MEI YAOCHEN This means winning by intimidation. WANG XI It means if you cannot completely thwart the schemes of the enemy, you should then work on his alliances, to try to make them fall apart. HO YANXI What Master Sun said was to attack when you come in contact with the enemy, meaning that when your forces are about to clash, you set up a dummy force to scare them and make them unable either to advance or retreat, and then take advantage of that opportunity to come up and conquer them. Since the neighbors have also been helped by this action of yours, the enemy cannot but be isolated and weak. Master Sun The next best is to attack the army. CAO CAO This means when the army is already formed. JIA LIN To be good at successful attack, deploying your forces without a hitch, is yet another notch down. Therefore a great warrior-emperor said, �One who fights for victory in front of bared blades is not a good general.� MEI YAOCHEN This means winning by fighting. Master Sun The lowest is to attack a city. Siege of a city is only done as a last resort. CAO CAO When the enemy has called in its resources and is defending a city, to attack them in this condition is the lowest form of military operation. LI QUAN When you garrison an army in a walled city, the officers get stale and the soldiers get lazy. DU YOU This means that when you attack cities and butcher towns, this is the lowest form of attack, because there are many casualties. WANG XI Soldiers are killed and maimed without necessarily taking over the city. ZHANG YU The siege of cities and butchering of towns not only ages the army and wastes resources, it also has a lot of casualties, so it is the lowest form of attack. When you besiege a city, then your power will be used up in that, so you do it only if it is absolutely necessary, as a last resort. Master Sun Take three months to prepare your machines and three months to complete your siege engineering. DU MU He means that it is necessary to take time to really prepare machines and constructions thoroughly, lest many people be injured. As one of the ancient strategists said, �Those who cannot deploy their machines effectively are in trouble.� MEI YAOCHEN If neither intimidation nor intelligence are sufficient to overcome people, and you have no choice but to attack them where they live, then you must take adequate time to prepare. ZHANG YU Some say that Master Sun�s point
