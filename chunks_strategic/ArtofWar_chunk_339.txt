is made abundantly clear in the classic of Sun Wu, where he says, When order is consistently practiced to educate the people, then the people are obedient. When order is not practiced consistently to educate the people, then the people are disobedient. When order is consistently practiced, that means it is effective for the group. The principle that the operative order must be consistent with the effective character and capacity of the group is also emphasized by Sun Bin, who says, When people obey rules without rewards or punishments, these are orders that the people can carry out. When the high are rewarded and the low punished, and yet the people do not obey orders, these are orders that the people are unable to carry out. The strategic importance of order is the intensive exertion of force or capacity that order makes possible. Sun Wu explains it in this way: �What normally makes managing a large group similar to managing a small group is a system of order.� The facilitation of intensive exertion is forcefully illustrated by Sun Bin in these terms: �When all is in order, the battle line moves with a shocking commotion.� To represent the inner cohesion of the organization, by which the integrity of the order is maintained, Sun Bin again uses the image of a body, implying that the total integrity and discipline of the whole order depends on the personal integrity and discipline of each individual in the organization: �When one joint aches, all hundred joints are disabled, because they are the same body.� The actualization of an effectively unified order is thus naturally a matter of critical concern. Primary emphasis is placed on the moral and intellectual character of leadership because this unification cannot be attained by simple fiat. According to Sun Wu, the attainment of objective organizational integrity depends on the realization of subjective organizational unity: If soldiers are punished before an emotional bond has formed [with the leadership], they will not be obedient, and if they are not obedient they are hard to direct. If penalties are not enforced once this emotional bond has formed, then the soldiers cannot be directed. So unite them culturally and unify them militarily; this is considered the way to certain victory. This was the concern of the king who asked, �How can I get my people to follow orders as an ordinary matter of course?� To this Sun Bin replied, �Be trustworthy as an ordinary matter of course.� The need for correspondingly effective objective order does, nevertheless, remain imperative; Sun Wu says: �Whether there is order or unruliness depends on the operative logic of the order.� In terms of organizational structure, the logic of an operation depends on the recognition and employment of individual capacities in such a way as to maximize their efficiency within the body of the whole, as noted by Sun Bin when he says, �When setting up official posts, you should do so in a manner appropriate to the individual.� The
