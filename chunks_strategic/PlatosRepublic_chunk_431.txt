they have mastery over chance. To this end communism was instituted, women were treated like men, and the family was abolished. The guardians were turned into a herd like a herd of cattle which can be used by a breeder, and all the ordinarily cherished human ways of loving and reproducing were sï¿½uppressed by the rulers' marriage regu? lations and manipulations. The perfect artisans rule animals in order to reduce the disproportion that is always present in human herds, as opposed to brutish ones, between nature and convention, between the good and one's own. The nuptial number represents this science of eugenics, and the failure of the re? gime indicates the failure of its project. This conclusion is supported by the corruption of the son of the aristocratic father (549c ff.) which is meant to be the parallel to the corruption of the aristocratic city. The son falls from his fa? ther's way of life because of a disharmony between the mother and the father. To see this in another light one might well look to Aristophanes' char- acterization of the problems which beset Socrates. The philosopher believes himself to be independent of convention and devotes himself, along with a so? ciety of companions, to study of the highest things for its own sake. But, in? sists Aristophanes, the philosopher has not reflected sufficiently on the precon? ditions of such a way of life and is actually dependent on the city and its con? ventions. He does nothing useful and produces none of the vital necessities, but he needs food and clothing. So he must steal to keep alive. And he needs philosophic companions; but his is an all-male society which cannot reproduce itself; therefore he must, as it were, steal the city's sons away from its concerns in order to recruit them for his society. Aristophanes shows that the city will not tolerate such a lawbreaker in its midst. Socrates respon,ds in the Republic by asserting that if the philosopher adopts Aristophanes' two proposals in the Ecclesia::.usae-the equality of women and total communism-he can con? struct a regime in which his philosophic life will not be in contradiction with his political life. This city will feed and clothe him. And in it women will give birth to children who are to be philosophers and not members of a family or citizens in the usual sense of the word; natural animal reproduction will replen? ish the philosophers' society which represents the natural human way of life, thus producing a harmony between the two senses of nature and showing that the tension between city and philosophers is neither natural nor necessary. Soc? rates with a science of eugenics could, by means of bodily procreation, have children who were potential philosophers and would no longer be forced to abandon his own in quest of good men; body and soul, city and philosopher, would work together. The failure to achieve control over births signals an even more comic failure of Socrates than that
