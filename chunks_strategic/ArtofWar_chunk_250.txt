arrows and rocks, or for soldiers to plunge eagerly into the fray of battle, they must be induced by serious rewards; then they will prevail over an enemy. The rule is �Where there are serious rewards, there will be valiant men� (�Three Strategies,� also in �Six Secrets�). At the end of the Han dynasty, whenever Cao Cao plundered a city and obtained rare and beautiful objects, he would always use them to reward achievement. To people who had worked hard and were worthy of reward, he would not begrudge even a thousand pieces of gold, while to those without merit he would give nothing. Therefore he was able to win battle after battle. Punishment and Battle Liu Ji said: What will make soldiers in battle dare to go forward and not dare to retreat is a strict penalty for anyone who retreats even an inch. Thus it is possible to gain victory by this means. The rule is �Punishment should be immediate� (�Sima�s Rules,� �Duties of the Emperor�). Yang Su (d. 606) was a great general of the brief but momentous Sui dynasty (589�617). His command was strict and orderly; anyone who violated military orders was immediately executed, with no exceptions. Whenever General Yang was about to face an opponent, he would look for people to make mistakes so he could execute them. Sometimes over a hundred men would be killed; it was never less than several dozen. He himself would talk and laugh casually as the flowing blood flooded the ground before him. Then when he faced the enemy on the battle line, he would first command three hundred men to attack. If they were able to break the opponent�s battle line, they were all right; if they returned without being able to strike through enemy lines, they would all be executed, regardless of their number. Then General Yang would send ahead another two or three hundred men, and again killed any who returned. As a result, the commanders and soldiers trembled in fear and were determined to fight to the death. Therefore they consistently won in battle. Defensive Battle Liu Ji said: In any battle, if another is the aggressor and you are the defender, you should not be too quick to fight. If your army is at rest and the soldiers are watching over their homes, you should gather people to guard the cities and fortify the mountain passes, cutting off the aggressors� supply routes. When they do not succeed in drawing you into battle, and their supplies do not reach them, wait until they are worn out and then strike them. If you do this you will always win. The rule is �Fighting on your own territory is called a ground of dissolution� (Sun Tzu, The Art of War, �Nine Grounds�). Wu Di (371�409) was the Martial Emperor of the Later Wei dynasty, a foreign regime in northern China under the rule of the Toba people. He personally led an expedition against the Later Yan dynasty,
