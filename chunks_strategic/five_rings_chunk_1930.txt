"That's entirely certain," hesaid. 536a "And with respect tomoderation," Isaid, "and courage and magnificence and alltheparts ofvirtue, aspecial guard mustbekept for themanwho isbastard andtheonewho isgenuine.

Justice herself viill notblame us,andweshall save the cityandtheregime; while, in bringing men ofanother sort toit,weshalldoexactly theopposite andalsopourevenmore ridicule overphilosophy." "That," hesaid,"would indeed beshameful." "Most certainly," Isaid. "But Iseem tohavebeen somewhat ridiculously affected justnow." "How's that?" hesaid. "Iforgot," Isaid, "thatwewere playing andspoke rather in- c tensely. For, asIwastalking 1looked atPhilosophy and, seeing her underservingly spattered viithmud, Iseem tohavebeenvexed andsaid what Ihadtosaytooseriously asthough myspiritedness were aroused against thosewhoareresponsible."

[215 ] glaucon/socrates IHiliKiLrUULIC 536d "Why not?" e "Because," Isaid, "the freemanought nottolearn anystudy slavishly.

"Therefore, youbestofmen," Isaid, "don't useforce intraining "is?a thechildren inthestudies, butrather play. Inthatwayyoucanalso better discern what each isnaturally directed toward."
