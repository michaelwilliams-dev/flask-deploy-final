me to look after the sacrifices." "Am I not the heir of what belongs to you?" said Polemarchus.20 "Certainly," he said and laughed. And with that he went away to the sacrifices.21 "Tell me, you, the heir of the argument," I said, "what was it Si? monides said about justice that you assert he said correctly?" "That it is just to give to each what is owed," he said. "In saying this he said a fine thing, at least in my opinion." "Well, it certainly isn't easy to disbelieve a Simonides," I said. "He is a wise and divine man. However, you, Polemarchus, perhaps know what on earth he means, but I don't understand. For plainly he doesn't mean what we were just saying-giving back to any man what? soever something he has deposited when, of unsound mind, he demands it. And yet, what he deposited is surely owed to him, isn't it?" 331 a b C d e 332 a 332 a b C d "Yes." "But, when of unsound mind he demands it, it should under no condition be given back to him?" "True," he said. "Then Simonides, it seems, means something different from this sort of thing when he says that it is just to give back what is owed." "Of course it's different, by Zeus," he said. "For he supposes that friends owe it to friends to do some good and nothing bad." "I understand," I said. "A man does not give what is owed in giv? ing back gold to someone who has deposited it, when the giving and the taking tum out to be bad, assuming the taker and the giver are friends. Isn't this what you assert Simonides means?" "Most certainly." "Now, what about this? Must we give back to enemies whatever is owed to them?" "That's exactly it," he said, "just what's owed to them. And I suppose that an enemy owes his enemy the very thing which is alsoï¿½ fitting: some harm." "Then," I said, "it seems that Simonides made a riddle, after the fashion of poets, when he said what the just is. For it looks as if he thought that it is just to give to everyone what is fitting, and to this he gave the name 'what is owed."' "What else do you think?" he said. "In the name of Zeus," I said, "if someone were to ask him, 'Simonides, the art22 called medicine gives what that is owed and fitting to which things?' what do you suppose he would answer us?" "It's plain," he said, "drugs, foods and drinks to bodies." "The art called cooking gives what that is owed and fitting to which things?" "Seasonings to meats." "All right. Now then, the art that gives what to which things would be called justice?" "If the answer has to be consistent with what preceded, Socrates," he said, "the one that gives benefits and harms to friends and enemies." "Does he mean that justice is doing good to
