"That's entirely certain," he said. "Therefore, it is a harvest greater by such ills that is reaped by a man who has a bad regime in himself.-the one you just now judged most wretched, the tyrannic man-and who doesn't live out his life as a private man but is compelled by some chance to be a tyrant, and while not having control of himself attempts to rule others, just as if a man with a body that is sick and without control of itself were com- b. pelled to spend his life not in a private station but contesting and fighting with other bodies." "The case is in every way most similar," he said, "and what you say, Socrates, is most true."
