know a noble spirit by the elevation of his taste: it must be a great thing that can satisfy a great mind. Big bites for big mouths, lofty things for lofty spirits. Before their judgment the bravest tremble, the most perfect lose con�dence. Things of the �rst importance are few; let appreciation be rare. Taste can be imparted by intercourse: great good luck to associate with the highest taste. But do not a.ect to be dissatis�ed with everything: 'tis the extreme of folly, and more odious if from a.ectation than if from Quixotry. Some would have God create another world and other ideals to satisfy their fantastic imagination. See that Things end well. Some regard more the rigour of the game than the winning of it, but to the world the discredit of the �nal failure does away with any recognition of the previous care. The victor need not explain. The world does not notice the details of the measures employed; but only the good or ill result. You lose nothing if you gain your end. A good end gilds everything, however unsatisfactory the means. Thus at times it is part of the art of life to transgress the rules of the art, if you cannot end well otherwise. Prefer Callings "en Evidence." Most things depend on the satisfaction of others. Esteem is to excellence what the zephyr is to �owers, the breath of life. There are some callings which gain universal esteem, while others more important are without credit. The former, pursued before the eyes of all, obtain the universal favour; the others, though they are rarer and more valuable, remain obscure and unperceived, honoured but not applauded. Among princes conquerors are the most celebrated, and therefore the kings of Aragon earned such applause as warriors, conquerors, and great men. An able man will prefer callings en evidence which all men know of and utilise, and he thus becomes immortalised by universal su.rage. It is better to help with Intelligence than with Memory. The more as the latter needs only recollection, the former nous. Many persons omit the a propos because it does not occur to them; a friend's advice on such occasions may enable them to see the advantages. 'Tis one of the greatest gifts of mind to be able to o.er what is needed at the moment: for want of that many things fail to be performed. Share the light of your intelligence, when you have any, and ask for it when you have it not, the �rst cautiously, the last anxiously. Give no more than a hint: this �nesse is especially needful when it touches the interest of him whose attention you awaken. You should give but a taste at �rst, and then pass on to more when that is not su.cient. If he thinks of No, go in search of Yes. Therein lies the cleverness, for most things are not obtained simply because they are not attempted. Do not give way to every common Impulse.
