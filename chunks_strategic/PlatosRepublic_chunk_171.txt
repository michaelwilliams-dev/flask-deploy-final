"What class of thing are you speaking of?" he said. "It's that which you call light," I said. "What you say is true," he said. "Then the sense of sight and the power of being seen are yoked together with a yoke that, by the measure of an idea by no means insignificant, is more honorable than the yokes uniting other teams, if light is not without honor." "But, of course," he said, "it's far from being without honor." "Which of the gods in heaven can you point to as the lord respon? sible for this, whose light makes our sight see in the finest way and the seen things seen?"
