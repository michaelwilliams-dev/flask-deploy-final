asfarawayaspossible.AsGonzalo and his men followed theleads theIndiansgave them, then, theywere onlyledfarther intodeep jungle. Theexplorers’ spirits sagged.Their uniforms hadlong since shredded; their armor rusted andthey threw itaway; their shoes were torn topieces, forcing them towalk barefoot; theIndian slaves theyhad setoutwith had either died ordeserted them; theyhad eaten notonly the svsnne but the hunting dogsand llamas. Theylived onroots and fruit. Realizingthatthey could not continue thisway,Pizarro decided torisk river travel, and a bargewas built outofrottingwood. Butthejourneydown thetreacherous NapoRiver provednoeasier. Setting upcamponthen‘ver’s edge, Gonzalo sent scouts ahead onthebargetofind Indian settlements with food. He waited and waited forthe scouts toreturn, onlytofind outtheyhad de- cided todesert theexpeditionand continue down theriver ontheir own. The rain continued without end. Gonzalo’s men forgot about ElDo- rado; theywanted onlytoreturn toQuito. Finally,inAugustof1542, alit- tleover ahundred men, from anexpedition originally numberinginthe thousands, managedtofind their way back. Totheresidents ofQuito they seemed tohave emergedfrom hellitself, wrappedintatters andskins, their bodies covered insores, and soemaciated astobeunrecognizable.For over ayearand ahalftheyhad marched inanenormous circle, two thou- sand miles byfoot. The vast sums ofmoney invested intheexpeditionhad yielded nothing-—no sign ofElDorado and nosignofgold. interpretation Even after Gonzalo Pizano’s disaster, theSpaniardslaunched expedition after expeditioninSearch ofElDorado. And like Pizarro theconquistadors would burn and lootvillages, torture Indians, endure unimaginable hard- ships, andgetnocloser togold. The money they spentonsuch expeditions cannot becalculated; yetdespitethefutility ofthesearch, thelure ofthe fantasy endured. Notonlydidthesearch forElDorado cost millions oflives——both In» dian andSpanish—it helped bringtheruin oftheSpanish empire. Gold be- came Spain’s obsession. Thegoldthat didfind itsway back toSpain——and alotclid~—was reinvested inmore expeditions,orinthepurchase ofluxu- ries, rather than inagricultureoranyother productiveendeavor. Whole Spanishtowns were depopulatedastheir menfolk lefttohunt gold.Farms fellintomin, and thearmy had norecruits foritsEuropeanwars. Bythe endofthe seventeenth century, theentire country had shrunk bymore than half ofitspopulation; thecityofMadrid had gone from apopulation of400,000 to150,000. With diminishingreturns from itsefforts over so many years, Spain fellinto adecline from which itnever recovered. Power requires selfidiscipline.

Transgression ll Intheearly eighteenth century,no one stood higher inEnglish society than theDuke and Duchess ofMarlborough.The duke, havingled sue» cessful campaigns againsttheFrench, was considered Europe’s premier generalandstrategist. And hiswife, theduchess, after much maneuvering, hadestablished herself asthefavorite ofQueen Anne, who became ruler ofEngland in1702. In1704 theduke’s triumphattheBattle ofBlenheim made him the toast ofEngland,and tohonor him thequeen awarded him alarge plot ofland inthe town ofWoodstock, and thefunds tocreate a great palace there. Calling hisplannedhome thePalace ofBlenheim, the duke chose ashisarchitect theyoung john Vanbrugh,akind ofRenais- sance man who wroteplaysaswell asdesigned buildings.And so con— struction began,inthe summer of1705, with much fanfare andgreat hopes. Vanbrugh had adramatist’s sense ofarchitecture. Hispalacewas tobe amonument toMar1borough’s brilliance and power, and was toinclude artificial lakes, enormous bridges,elaborate gardens,and other fantastical touches. From day one, however, theduchess could notbepleased: She thought Vanbrughwaswasting moneyonyetanother stand oftrees; she wanted
