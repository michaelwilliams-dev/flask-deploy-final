who are ruled? Now tell me this much: don't we, at all events, al? ways say that each of the arts is different on the basis ofhaving a dif? ferent capacity? And don't answer contrary to your opinion, you blessed man, so that we can reach a conclusion." "Yes," he said, "this is the way they differ." "And does each of them provide us with some peculiar41 benefit and not a common one, as the medical art furnishes us with health, the pilot's art with safety in sailing, and so forth with the others?" "Certainly." "And does the wage-earner's art furnish wages? For this is its power. Or do you call the medical art the same as the pilot's art? Or, if you wish to make precise distinctions according to the principle you set down, even if a man who is a pilot becomes healthy because sailing on the sea is advantageous to him, nonetheless you don't for that reason call what he does the medical art?" � "Surely not," he said. 345. b C d e 346a b 345. b "Nor do you, I suppose, call the wage-earner's art the medical art, even if a man wbo is earning wages should be healthy?" "Surely not," he said. "And, what about this? Do you call the medical art the wage? earner's art, even if a man practicing medicine should earn wages?" C He said that he did not. "And we did agree that the benefit of each art is peculiar?" "Let it be," he said. "Then whatever benefit all the craftsmen derive in common is plainly derived from their additional use of some one common thing that is the same for all." "It seems so," he said. "And we say that the benefit the craftsmen derive from receiving wages comes to them from their use of the _"_Vp.ge-earner's art in addi? tion." He assented with resistance. d. "Then this benefit, getting wages, is for each not a result of his own art; but, if it must be considered precisely, the medical art pro? duces health, and the wage-earner's art wages; the housebuilder's art produces a house and� the wage-earner's art, following upon it, wages; and so it is with all the others: each accomplishes its own work and benefits that which it has been set over. And if pay were not attached to it, would the craftsman derive benefit from the art?" e. "l t doesn't look like it," he said. "Does he then produce no benefit when he works for nothing?" "I suppose he does/' "Therefore, Thrasymachus, it is plain by now that no art or kind of rule provides for its own benefit, but, as we have been saying all along, it provides for and commands the one who is ruled, considering his advantage-that of the weaker-and not that of the stronger. It is for just this reason, my dear Thrasymachus, that I said a moment ago that no one willingly chooses to rule and get mixed up
