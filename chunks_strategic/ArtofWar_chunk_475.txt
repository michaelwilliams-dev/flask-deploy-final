the hearts of all. In the present passage, then, I think that the true reading must be, not �plunder,� but �do not plunder.�" Alas, I fear that in this instance the worthy commentator�s feelings outran his judgment. Tu Mu, at least, has no such illusions. He says: "When en- camped on �serious ground,� there being no inducement as yet to advance further, and no possibility of retreat, one ought to take measures for a pro- tracted resistance by bringing in provisions from all sides, and keep a close watch on the enemy."] In difficult ground, keep steadily on the march. [Or, in the words of VIII. ss. 2, "do not encamp.] 1. On hemmed-in ground, resort to stratagem. [Ts�au Kung says: "Try the effect of some unusual artifice;" and Tu Yu amplifies this by saying: "In such a position, some scheme must be de- vised which will suit the circumstances, and if we can succeed in deluding CHAPTER 12. THE NINE SITUATIONS 97 the enemy, the peril may be escaped." This is exactly what happened on the famous occasion when Hannibal was hemmed in among the moun- tains on the road to Casilinum, and to all appearances entrapped by the dictator Fabius. The stratagem which Hannibal devised to baffle his foes was remarkably like that which T�ien Tan had also employed with success exactly 62 years before. [See IX. ss. 24, note.] When night came on, bundles of twigs were fastened to the horns of some 2000 oxen and set on fire, the terrified animals being then quickly driven along the mountain side towards the passes which were beset by the enemy. The strange spectacle of these rapidly moving lights so alarmed and discomfited the Romans that they withdrew from their position, and Hannibal�s army passed safely through the defile. [See Polybius, III. 93, 94; Livy, XXII. 16 17.] On desperate ground, fight. [For, as Chia Lin remarks: "if you fight with all your might, there is a chance of life; where as death is certain if you cling to your corner."] 1. Those who were called skillful leaders of old knew how to drive a wedge between the enemy�s front and rear; [More literally, "cause the front and rear to lose touch with each other."] to prevent co-operation between his large and small divisions; to hinder the good troops from rescuing the bad, the officers from rallying their men. 1. When the enemy�s men were united, they managed to keep them in dis- order. 2. When it was to their advantage, they made a forward move; when other- wise, they stopped still. [Mei Yao-ch�en connects this with the foregoing: "Having succeeded in thus dislocating the enemy, they would push forward in order to secure any advantage to be gained; if there was no advantage to be gained, they would remain where they were."] 1. If asked how to cope with a great host of the enemy in orderly array and on the point of marching to the attack, I
