before she met him her aesthetics had been abysmal. When Collis Huntington died, in1900, Arabella came into afortune. She suddenly started tobuy expensive paintings, byRembrandt and Velazquez, forexa.rnple—and only from Duveen. Years later Duveen sold herGainsb0rough’s Blue Boyforthehighest priceever paid for awork of artatthetime, anastounding purchase for a.family thatpreviously had shown little interest incollecting. Interpretation josephDuveen instantly understood Arabella Huntingtonand what made hertick: She wanted tofeelimportant,athome insociety. lntenselyinse- cure about her lowerclass background, she needed confirmation ofher new social smtus. Duveen waited. lnstead ofrushinginto tryingtoper- suade her tocollect art, hesubtlywent towork onher weaknesses. He made herfeel that shedeserved hisattention notbecause she was thewife ofoneofthewealthiest men intheworld butbecause ofher own special character--and thiscompletelymelted her. Duveen never condescended toArabella; rather than lecturingtoher, heinstilled hisideas inherindi- rectly. The result was oneofhisbest and most devoted clients, and also the saleofTheBhze Bay.

Observance V In1862 King William ofPrussia named Otto Von Bismarck premierand minister forforeign affairs. Bismarck was known forhisboldness, hisa.rnbi~ tion—~and hisinterest instrengthening themilitary.Since Wflliam was sur- rounded byliberals inhisghvemmentandcabinet, politicians who already wanted tolimit hispowers,itwasquite dangerous forhim toputBismarck inthis sensitive position.Hiswife, Queen Augusta,had tried todissuade him, butalthoughsheusually gother way with him, this time William stuck tohisguns. Onlyaweek after becoming prime minister, Bismarck made anim- promptu speechtoafew dozen ministers toconvince them oftheneed to enlarge thearmy. Heended bysaying, “The great questionsofthetime willbedecided, notbyspeeches and resolutions ofmajorities, butbyiron andblood.” Hisspeechwasimmediately disseminated throughout Ger- many.Thequeenscreamed ather husband that Bismarck was abarbaric militar-ist who was out tousurpcontrol ofPrussia, andthat William had to firehim. The liberals inthegovernment agreed with her. Theoutcrywas sovehement that Williarn begantobeafraid hewould endupon ascaf- fold, likeLouis XVI ofFrance, ifhekeptBismarck on asprimeminister. Bismarck knew hehad togettotheking before itwas toolate. Healso knew hehadblundered, and should have temperedhisfierywords. Yet as hecontemplatedhisstrategy,hedecided not toapologizebut todothe exact opposite,Bismarck knew thekingwell.(Yzciar had in;trloczirri them, inltoper rim: young gentlemen, who hurl notknown much c‘/flzutrlnr and wounds, but came wearing their hair long. inzhzvflower nfrheir ageandheight ofthllll’ beauty, would bemore uppre/1t’r1.s'ive afiuch blows, and not am:forlmzurding hmh adangrlr II!pr:-smu cum’ 1:bleniish farthe future, And soitpmved, for theywere .m_/nrfrom l.Vc'rzr‘11-xg thextmke of rlwjavclins, that Iizey could notSlund the sight oft/rem. but turned about, and covered their 1224,-es to xc-cure rhem.
