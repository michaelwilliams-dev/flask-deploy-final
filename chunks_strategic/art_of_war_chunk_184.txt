uneasy, so they call to each other to strengthen themselves. CHEN HAO If there is one person in ten with courage, even though the other nine are timid and cowardly, depending on the bravery of that one man they can still be secure. Now if the soldiers call out in the night, it is because the general has no courage, as Cao Cao says. Master Sun If the army is unsettled, it means the general is not taken seriously. LI QUAN If the general lacks authority, the army is disorderly. Master Sun If signals move, that means they are in confusion. ZHANG YU Signals are used to unify the group, so if they move about unsteadily, it means the ranks are in disarray. Master Sun If their emissaries are irritable, it means they are tired.

MEI YAOCHEN When people are so worn out that they cannot carry out orders, they are punished again and again to establish authority. Master Sun To be violent at first and wind up fearing one�s people is the epitome of ineptitude. LI QUAN To act inconsiderately and later be afraid is bravery without firmness, which is extremely incompetent. Master Sun Those who come in a conciliatory manner want to rest.
