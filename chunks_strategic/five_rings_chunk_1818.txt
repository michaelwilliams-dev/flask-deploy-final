when they are not asked ,but hehas toask for counsel often .He has tolisten patiently tothe truth from those he has consulted .Many people deceive themselves who believe that aPrince reputed tobeprudent isnot really sobynature ,but only byvirtue ofgood counsel around him .But itisageneral rule that seldom falls :namely ,that aPrince who isnot himself wise can- not becounseled well ,unless heentrust one person alone who is himself prudent .Inthat case ,itcould gowell ,but probably not for long ,because such agovernor would belikely totake over the state himself .Ifthe Prince relies onmore than one person ,ifheis not himself wise ,hewill never have aconsensus nor know how tounite his counselors .The counselors will each think oftheir own interest and the Prince won't know how tocorrect them or whom totrust .APrince can't expect otherwise because men will always turn out badly unless necessity constrains them tobe good .So Iconclude that good counsel ,nomatter where itcomes from ,has tostart with the prudence ofthe Prince himself— for the prudence ofthe Prince cannot itself come from good counsel . REASONS WHY ITALIAN PRINCES TheaandHAVE LOST THEIR STATES newguidelinesfirmPrinceinhisIappearhaveseatevengiven,established.thanprudentlyifheHewereobserved,willtraditionallybemorewillsecuremake es- tablished. Anew Prince ismuch more closely watched than ahe- reditary Prince. When virtuous, they attract men anddraw them toservice more than traditional dynasties. Men aremore drawn bythepresent than bythepast. When they meet something good inthepresent, they appreciate itanddon't look elsewhere. They willdoeverything foragood new Prince aslong asthey don't lack inanything themselves. Anew Prince canhave double glory: forhaving given birth toanewPrincipality, andforhaving furnished itwith good laws, strong andoutstanding examples — justasthePrince who isborn toitcansuffer double shame who through imprudence loses hisPrincipality. Ifyouconsider thePrinces inItaly who have recently lost their states —liketheKing ofNaples, theDuke ofMilan, and others —youwillnote, first, aweakness inarms asdiscussed above, andyouwillnote thattheyhadeither enemies inthepopu- laceor,ifthey were popular, they couldn't getthenobles ontheir side.

Intimes ofpeace nothaving thought things could change (acommon defense among men who ingood weather dis- count thedanger ofstorms), they findwhen times turn badthey turn toflight anddon't defend themselves.
