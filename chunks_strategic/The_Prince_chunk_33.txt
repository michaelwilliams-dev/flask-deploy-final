emperor � when they want to, and don't fear other lords around them. They are adequately fortified so that any enemy re.alizes that any assault will be tedious and hard. These cities have ditches and walls around them and maintain enough artillery. Their stores hold enough drink, food, and fuel for a year. They keep a backlog and pay enough to supply the army, nerve and life of the city, for a year and the public citizens doing public works. Their militia are qualified and they maintain these security forces well. A Prince, who fortifies his city well and who is not hated by THE PRINCE � 69 the populace, is not easy to attack.
