that hence it is somewhat questionable for other men as well. For the philosopher to dedicate himself to the city would not result either in the salvation of mankind or the promotion of his own wisdom. He has to live in a city, however, and must count on other men to preserve him; therefore he must care for at least a modicum of justice in the city. But this care is only necessary, not desirable in itself. The answer to Glaucon's ques? tion-Is justice good in itself or only instrumentally?-is that justice conceived as dedication to the city is only instrumentally good. But there is one kind of doing good to one's friends which is also beneficial to the philosopher. There are some young men in whom his soul delights, for they have souls akin to his own and are potential philosophers; these are men who may even aid him in his uncompleted quest for wisdom. G]aucon himself may we11 be one of them. In the case of most citizens, the phi1osopher's concern is only that he do them no harm, and his justice thus has the character of a burdensome duty. In the case of the promising young, he is concerned with doing them a [ 411 J positive good, and his justice has the character of love. He must always carry on a contest with the city for the affections of its sons. Although he has a duty to the city, he is always at war with it. (543a-569c) The elaboration of the best regime and the way of life corresponding to it is not a sufficient response to Glaucon�s original demand, which was to compare the life of the just man and that of the unjust man with respect to their happiness. In his speech in favor of in? justice Glaucon described the advantages of the unjust man�s life; those alleged advantages must be looked at again in the light of what Glaucon has learned in the course of the dialogue. If Glaucon is to be converted he must compare what previously attracted him with what he has come' to admire. This calls for a presentation of the bad regimes of city and soul as well as the good. Following the hypothesis of the dialogue, according to which the city is the soul writ large, Socrates turns first to the discussion of the in? ferior cities. The parallelism of the city and the soul is maintained here (as it was in Book IV) in spite of the fact that it has become most ques? tionable. This procedure has the rhetorical advantage of making justice, which is admittedly desirable in a city, appear equally desirable in the soul. When Glaucon sees and is forced to admit that the city ruled by a tyrant is a terrible place, he is more easily induced to view the tyrant as a terrible man. In preparing the direct confrontation of philosopher and tyrant for Glaucon�s benefit, Socrates makes use of Adeimantus and
