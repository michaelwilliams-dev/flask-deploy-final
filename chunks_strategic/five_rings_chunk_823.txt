Piero Soderini, Florence’s mayor, commissioned him to transform a ruined piece of marble into a statue. Soderini visited the studio one day and commented that the nose of the statue (that of David with a sling in his hand) was too big. Michelangelo invited the mayor to climb up a scaffolding, allowing him to look at the nose from a different perspective, while the artist chiseled a bit, pretending to correct the size of the nose. The mayor was convinced the nose looked much better. Michelangelo succeeded in making Soderini think his comment had helped improve the work.
