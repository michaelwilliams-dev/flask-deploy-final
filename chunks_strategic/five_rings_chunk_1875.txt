Andthemanwho's notofthissortmustberejected. Theselection and appointment oftherulers andguardians is,inmyopinion, Glaucon," I said,"something like this, notdescribed precisely, butbyway ofa model." "That," hesaid, "istheway itlooks tometoo." "Isn't itthen trulymost correct tocallthesemencomplete guard- b ians?They canguard overenemies from without andfriends from within— sothattheones willnotwish todoharm andtheothers will beunable to.Theyoung, whomwewere calling guardians uptonow, weshall callauxiliaries andhelpers oftherulers' convictions."
