the same, does it par? ticipate in being any more than in knowledge ?"8 "Not at all." 584 e 585 a b C 585 C d e 586a b C "Anyï¿½ more than in truth?" "No, not that either." "And if less in truth, less in being also?" "Necessarily." "Generally, isn't it the case that the classes that have to do with the care of the body participate less in truth and being than those hav? ing to do with the care of the soul?" "Far less." "Don't you suppose the same ili the case with body itself as com? pared to soul?" "I do." "Isn't what is full of things that are more, and itself is more, really fuller than what is full of things that are less and itself is less?" "Of course." "Therefore, if it is pleasant to become full of what is by nature suitable, that which is more really full of things that are more would cause one to enjoy true pleasure more really and truly, while what par? takes in things that are less would be less truly and surely full and would partake in a pleasure less trustworthy and less true." "Most necessarily," he said.

"That, Socrates," said Glaucon, "is exactly the life of the many presented in the form of an oracle." "Then isn't it also necessary that the pleasures they live with be mixed with pains-mere phantoms and shadow paintings of true pleasure? Each takes its color by contrast with the others, so that they look vivid and give birth to frenzied loves of themselves in the foolish and are fought over, like the phantom of Helen that Stesichorus says the men at Troy fought over out of ignorance of the truth."9 "Ifs most necessary," he said, "that it be something like that." "And what about this? In what concerns the spirited part, won't other like things necessarily come to pass for the man who brings this part to its fulfillment-either by envy due to love of honor, or by 586 violence due to love of victory, or
