isthefactthatinsome sense reason inthesoul isadesire, andthatspiritedness, totheextent that itopposes desire, opposes reason also.Hewasenabled todothisby asserting thatreason inthesoul ismerely calculation, asitisinthecity. Adry,calculating reason, concerned withdirecting thedesires toafulfill- ment consonant with thecommon good, isdistinct from desire andneed notconflict with spiritedness; butareason erotically striving toknow the firstcauses ofallthings, with alifeofitsown, indifferent tothe needs ofthehereandnow, isoneofthemostpowerful desires andfar removed from thecity's primary concerns. Spiritedness willoppose it assurely asitdoesanyoftheother forms oferos.Reason exists incities butonly intheform ofpolitical prudence. Timocracy, theregime found- edonspiritedness, istheregime mostopenly hostile tophilosophy {547 e). Acity, likeaman, desires wealth, needs food,anddeliberates. Butacity cannot reproduce orphilosophize; allforms oferosarecut off"from it. Inthissense acitycannot beproperly compared toaman. Itcanusethe offspring oferos,whether children orthoughts, but itmustmerely make useof,orconventionalize, theactivities which produce them. Inorder to make amanthoroughly political, onemust suppress ordistort allex- pressions ofhiseroticism. Inorder toseewhat Socrates leaves outhere, itishelpful tolook again atthewarrior classwhich issupposed toperform thesame func- tioninthecityasdoes spiritedness inthesoul.Thewarriors can, inthe service ofdesires, takefrom foreigners asconquerors, orthey can, in theservice ofthecity asawhole andtherulers, defend against in- vaders. Within thecity,theycansidewith thepeople, andhence the desires, against therulers andreason, ortheycansidewith therulers, notagainst thepeople, butforthepurpose ofcontrolling andguiding 376 ] Interpretive Essay them. Thewarriors areguided bygeneral opinions, orrules, whose grounds theydonotknow andexceptions towhich they cannot recognize. Forexample, theymust detest menwhodonotappear to care forthecity,who loveforeign things, who callthelawintoques- tion.Most suchmenwould indeed bevicious, butSocrates would also beamong them.Theywould instinctively hatehimandwant topunish him asanenemy, for,intheir lackofreason andidentification ofall goodwiththecity's good, theywould beunable todistinguish himfrom theothers. Therulers might beable tomake thenecessary distinctions, andthewarriors would most likely obey them; butonecould foresee a situation inwhich thewarriors rebelled against therulers because the rulers broke therules ofmorality theyhadinculcated inthewarriors. But, atallevents, from thepoint ofview ofthehealthy city,perhaps men likeSocrates should berepressed. Inpractice, spiritedness fre- quently rules overwisdom incities, leading tocrimes committed inthe name ofjustice. Moral indignation ledtotheexecution ofthegenerals whowere incommand atthegreat Athenian victory ofArginusae, but who, because ofastorm, were unable tosatisfy thepious duty of recovering thecorpses oftheirdead from thesea; thisexecution was carried outoverthestrenuous objections ofthewise Socrates. Moreover, Socrates' ownexecution wasaresult ofthesamemoral indignation. In both cases thegeneral principle ofthepeople wasavalid one;butin both they failed toseethemitigating circumstances, nottosaythe moral superiority ofthelawbreakers. Within theindividual soul, spiritedness expresses itself insimilar ways. Itcanlead tothevoracious conqueror ortheproud protector of hisown. Itcanalsoproduce theangry, petulant manwho flies intoa fury atwhat opposes hisdesires. And,most interesting ofall, itcan result inthemorally indignant manwhopunishes hisown desires as well asthose ofothers. Butinthecaseofthesoul thispunishment of offending desires ismore harmful than inthecity.The soul inwhich reason ismost developed will— likeLeontius' eyes— desire tosee all kinds ofthings which thecitizen isforbidden tosee; itwillabound with thoughts usually connected with selfishness, lust,andvice.Such asoul willbelikethatbanished poetry which contained images ofvice aswell asofvirtue. Spiritedness, intheform ofanger andshame, willoppose reason's desiring. This iswhytheaustere, moral Adeimantus ismuch moreopposed tophilosophy than isthevictory-loving, erotic Glaucon. Thus, spiritedness, which protected thecity's health, stands intheway ofthedevelopment ofthesoul's theoretical capacities andhence its health. Socrates inthispassage abstracts from allother aspects ofspirited- nessandfocuses solely ononeofitsfunctions— thecontrol ofdesire. In sodoing hemakes explicit itspolitical advantages andhints atthethreat [377 ] THEREPUBLIC itposes tophilosophy. Theharmony oftheparts ofthesoul ismost ques- tionable. Socrates concludes thatthesoulhasthesame parts asthecityand willbeperfected bythesame virtues. Thus thediscussion ofjustice should beatanend;andSocrates doesindeed trytoturn tothediscus-
