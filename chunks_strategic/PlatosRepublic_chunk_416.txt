Hisforgetfulness is in XIV, 294-351.The last words are a quote, not from Zeus, but from Homer speaking of Zeus (XIV, 296). 14. Odyssey, VIII, 266 ff. 15. Odyssey, XX, 17-18. 16. The source of this passage is unknown. Cf. Euripides, Medea, 964, "Gifts and speech persuade gods." 17. The word is metrion, derived from the word meaning "measure." The term is frequently equivalent to sophrosyne, but foi- the sake of making the reader able to follow the latter word, "sensible" will be used for metrion where "measure" cannot be properly used in English. 18. Iliad, IX, 515 ff.; XIX, 185-281; XXIV, 594. 19. Iliad, XXII, 15 and 20. 20. The Scamander, Iliad, XXI, 130-132, 212-226, 233 ff. 21. Iliad, XXIII, 140-151. 22. From the lost Niobe of Aeschylus. 23. The word for "prose writer" here is logopoios-literally, a "maker of speeches." It is usually applied to chroniclers and historians, or at Athens to those who write speeches for the use of others in court. 24. The word is lexis, which can also mean simply "a speech" but fre? quently means "manner or style of speech" or "diction in poetry." The word is related to logos. 8. Socrates does not mention the very first things in the Iliad (I, 1-11), the invocation to the goddess and Homer's claim that sbe tells the story. Soc? rates treats the poem as a fabrication of Homer, as not having a divine origin. He is thus able to blame Homer without impiety. Homer becomes an in? novator instead of a spokesman of the gods. Socrates' intention is akin to that of certain schools of Biblical criticism. 8. Iliad, I, 15-16. 9. Eponyms, those names given to gods or heroes from places, deeds, or characteristics. 10. 376c, note 35. 11. The word is eras, which is "sexual passion" or "love." It can some- times be used synonymously with "desire" in general, as the most characteristic of desires or as representative of the character of desire. It is the second great element of the soul along with thymos, and its training is equally one of the primary objectives of the education. In the Republic its status is quite low, while that of thymos is correspondingly high. From its 6rst manifestation at 329c, through the present passage, to Book IX, where the tyrant is pre? sented as the erotic man par excellence; it is that which must be overcome. For a somewhat different evaluation of eros, the Symposium and the Phae? drus should be consulted. 8. The word, translated here as "harmonic mode," and in what suc? ceeds as simply "mode," is harmonia. "Rhythm" and harmonia are defined as follows in Laws, 664e: "... rhythm is the name given to the order of the mo? tion, while, as for sound, the mixture of high and low would receive the name harmonia." A harmonia is simply a scale, and the various scales constitute the different modes Socrates speaks of. Its simplest sense is that implied in the present context-the
