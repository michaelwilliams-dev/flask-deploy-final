thekind ofthing Englishmen orAmer- icans already think. However, itmight bemore prudent toletthe reader decide whether "the beautiful and thegood" aresimply equivalent to"moral values." Ifthey arethesame, hewillsoon enough find out.And ifthey arenot, asmaybethecase,hewillnot beprevented from finding that outandthereby putting hisown opinions tothetest.A Infact "values, inthis sense, isausage ofGerman origin popularized bysociologists inthe lastseventy-five years. Implicit in thisusage isthedistinction between "facts andvalues" andtheconse- quence thatends orgoals arenotbased onfactsbutaremere individual subjective preferences or,atmost, ideal creations ofthehuman spirit. [xiii] preface Whether thetranslator intends itornot,theword "values"coniures aseries ofthoughts which arealien toPlato. Every school childkn thatvalues arerelative, andthus thatthePlatowhoseems tode" them from facts, ortreatthem asfacts themselves, isunsophisticatr\When thecase isprejudged forhim inthisway,howcould thestud t ever findoutthattherewasonceanother wayoflooking atthese th' thathadsome plausibility? The textbecomes amirror inwhich hes only himself. Or,asNietzsche put it,thescholars digupwhat th themselves buried. Even ifPlato iswrong, thepre-history ofourcurrent wisdom" stillofsome importance sothat theinadequacies ofthetraditio1 teaching, which necessitated itsreplacement, maybecomeclear Similarly, theword "moral" isinappropriate. Itisquestionabl whether Platohada"moral philosophy." There isateaching about th virtues, some ofwhich find their roots inthecity,some inphilosonh But/in Plato there arenomoral virtues, aswefindthem firstdescribeH inAristotle's Ethics. This isasubtle question, onethatrequires Ion study, butonethatleads totheheart ofthedifference between Plat and Aristotle, andbeyond tothewhole dispute about thestatus of morality. Thus thetranslator hides another issue.Andeven if"th beautiful andthegood" doadduptowhatwemeanbymoralityit• well thatthestudent should know that forPlato morality iscomposed oftwoelements, oneofwhich lends acertain splendor toitwhich i lacking in,say,Kantian morality. And itmay alsobethecasethatthese twoelements arenotalways wholly inharmony. Thegood ortheiust need notalways bebeautiful orpoble, forexample, punishment- and thebeautiful ornoble need notalways begood orjust, forexamnlp Achilles' wrath. There isfurther matter forreflection here.- one might learn agreat deal ifonecould follow suchproblems throughout Plato's works. Itisonly inthisway thatastudent might reconstruct a plausible andprofound Platonic view oftheworld rather than findthe dialogues acompendiu mofunconvincing platitudes. F.M.Cornford, whose translation isnow theonemost widely used, ridicules literal translation and insists that itisoften" misleading, ortedious, orgrotesque and silly, orpompous andverbose" {The Republic [New York: Oxford University Press, 1956],p.v.). i doubt that itisoften misleading, although Iad|nit that itmay often lackthebeauty oftheoriginal. The issue iswhether acertainspuriouscharm— for itisnotPlato's charm— isworth thelossofawareness of Plato's problems necessitated byComford's notions about translation Itisonlybecause hedidnotseetheextent ofthelossthathecouldb socavalier with theoriginal. Hemade arather heavy joke atthe pense ofanearlier translator: [xiv] Preface Onewhoopened Jowett's version atrandom andlighted onthestate- ment (at549B) that thebest guardian foraman's "virtue" is "philosophy tempered with music," might runaway with theidea that inorder toavoid irregular relations withwomen, hehadbetter playtheviolin intheintervals ofstudying metaphysics. Theremay besome truth inthis;butonly afterreading widely inother parts of thebookwould hediscover that itwasnotquitewhat Platomeant bydescribing logos, combined withmusike, astheonlysure safe- guard oiarete (ibid., p.vi.). Butnomatter howwidely onereads inComford's translation, one cannot clarify thissentence orconnect itwith the-general problems developed throughout theRepublic; fortheonly possible sources ofclarification orconnection, theoriginal terms, have disappeared andhave been replaced byasentence meaningless initself and unillumined bythecarefully prepared antecedents which were in- tended togive thethought special significance. Corriford's version reads asfollows,".. .hischaracter isnotthoroughly sound, for lack oftheonly safeguard thatcanpreserve itthroughout life, a thoughtful andcultivated mind." Aliteral rendering would be" '. .. [he is]notpure inhisattachment tovirtue, having beenabandoned by thebestguardian . ..''What's that?'
