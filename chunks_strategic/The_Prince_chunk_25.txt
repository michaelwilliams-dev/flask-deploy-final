further glory of the King. When the Duke then won over Romagna and defeated the Colonnas, two things blocked him from proceeding further: one, his own armies, which were not loyal; the other, the will of France. Namely, the forces of the Orsini had left him and not only blocked new acquisition but also took away from him what he had already won. He was afraid that the King would do the same. Faenza attacked Bologna but the Orsini pulled off their forces. He saw the King's hand when after taking Urbino, the Duke assaulted Tuscany, but the King made THE PRINCE � 53 him stop. The Duke saw he could not depend anymore on the arms or fortunes of others. At first, this weakened the Orsini and Colonna parties in Rome. Their followers, noblemen, who were successful through them helped them hold Rome and they received honors and mili.tary posts. But in a few months, their loyalties were strained and they turned to the Duke. He awaited the opportunity to cut off the heads of the Orsini after disbanding the Colonnas � who then came over to his side, and whom he treated well.

It seemed as if he had gotten the friendship of Romagna and its and peoples and that he was going to enjoy the fruits of his labors. This part of the tale is worth noting and of use to imitate, and I won't hold it back. Having taken Romagna, he found powerless not Lords who only despoiled their subjects and sowed discord, union, so that the whole province was full of thieves, brigands, and all manner of insolence administered it. The Duke judged it necessary to give it good government in order to make it peaceful and obedient to his own rule. But he promoted Ramiro de Lorqua, a cruel and expedient man, to whom he entrusted full powers. De Lorqua subjugated Romagna quickly and efficiently, to his fame. The Duke had second thoughts and decided such excessive au. 54-Niccol� Machiavelli thority was too much, because he himself didn't want to become hated . He proposed
