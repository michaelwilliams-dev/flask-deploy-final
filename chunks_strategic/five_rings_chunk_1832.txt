merely conventional inequalities mustbeaccepted. This isaradical statement about therelationship between truthandjustice, onewhich leads totheparadox thatwisdom canruleonly inanelement dominated byfalsehood^It ishardly worth obscuring thisissue forthesake ofavoiding thecrudest ofmisun- derstandings. Andperhaps thepeculiarly modem phenomenon ofprop- aganda mightbecome clearer tothemanwho seesthat itissomehow related toacertain myth ofenlightenment which isitselfbrought into question bythePlatonic analysis.^ Beyond thegeneral problems affecting thetranslation ofallGreek andLatin texts, thePlatonic dialogues present aparticular difficulty. It isnottoohard tofindacceptable versions ofAristotle's treatises. This isbecause theyarenotentirely unlikemodem books. There is,onthe other hand, frequently alack ofclarity about thepurposes ofthe dialogue form. Plato iscommonly understood tohavehadateaching likethatofAristotle andtohave enclosed itinasweet coating designed toperform certain didactic orartistic functions butwhich mustbe stripped away togettothephilosophic core.Wethenhave Plato the poetandPlato thephilosopher, twobeings rolled intooneandcoexist- inginanuneasy harmony. This isthefatal errorwhich leads tothe distinction between formandsubstance. The student ofphilosophy then takes onepartofthedialogue ashisspecial domain andthestu- dentofliterature another ashis;thetranslator follows suit,using great license inthebulk ofthebookandreverting toacareappropriate to Aristotle when philosophy appears toenter. Cornford, asinallother things, expresses thecurrent tendency in aradical form.Hecutsoutmany oftheexchanges oftheinterlocutors andsuppresses entire arguments which donotseem tohim tocon- tribute tothemovement ofthedialogue. Although heclaims hiswish is tofulfill Plato's intentions inamodem context, hefinally confesses that "theconvention ofquestion andanswer becomes formal andfrequently tedious. Plato himself came near toabandoning itinhislatest work, the Laws ..."{ibid., p.vii).Comford thusimproves onPlato, correcting him inwhat hebelieves tobetheproper direction. Hethinks the dialogue form isonly aconvention, and,when itfatigues him,heaban- dons it.Itisatprecisely thispoint that>fene should begin toaskwhether weunderstand what adialogue really is.Itisneither poetry nor [xix] Treface philosophy; itissomething ofboth, but itisitselfandnotamerecom- bination ofthetwo.The factthatsometimes itdoesnotmeet thestan- dards ofthedramatic artreveals thesame thing asthefact that sometimes thearguments arenotuptothestandards ofphilosophical rigor:/ Plato's intention isdifferent from that ofthepoet orthe philosopher asweunderstand them.Tocallthedialogue aconvention istohide the,problem. Perhaps thisverytedium ofwhich Comford complains is/he testwhich Plato gives tothepotential philosopher to seewhether heiscapable ofovercoming thecharm ofexternal fonn;( foraharsh concentration onoften ugly detail isrequisite tothe philosophic enterprise/lt istheconcentration onbeauty tothedetri- ment oftruthwhich constitutes thecoreofhiscritique ofpoetry, justas theindifference toforms, andhence toman, constitutes thecoreofhis criticism ofpre-Socratic^philosophy/The dialogue isthesynthesis of thesetwopolesand isanorganic unity. Every argument mustbeinter- preted dramatically, forevery argument isincomplete initselfandonly thecontext cansupply themissing links.Andevery dramatic detail mustbeinterpreted philosophically, because these details contain the images oftheproblems which complete thearguments. Separately thesetwoaspects aremeaningless; together theyareaninvitation tothe philosophic quest. Comford cites theLaws asproof thatPlato gradually mended his ways; thushehasacertain Platonic justification forhischanges inthe text.Butthedifference informbetween theRepublic andtheLaws is notaresult ofPlato's oldagehaving taught himthedefects ofhisman- nered drama, asComford would have it,oritshaving caused him to lose hisdramatic flair, asothers assert. Rather thedifference reflects thedifferences intheparticipants inthedialogues andthereby thedif- ference ofintention ofthetwoworks. This isjustoneexample ofwhat istypical ofevery partofthePlatonic works. Bywayofthedrama one comes totheprofoundest issues. IntheRepublic Socrates discusses the bestregime, aregime which cannever beactualized, withtwoyoung menofsome theoretical giftswhom hetries toconvert from the lifeof political ambition toone inwhich philosophy plays arole.Hemust persuade them; every stepoftheargument isdirected totheir par- ticular opinions andcharacters. Their reasoned assent iscrucial tothe whole process. Thepoints atwhich they object toSocrates' reasoning arealways most important, andsoarethepoints when they assent when theyshould not.Each oftheexchanges reveals something, even when theresponses seemmost uninteresting. IntheLaws theAthenian Stranger engages inthenarrower taskofprescribing acode oflaws for apossible butinferior regime. Hisinterlocutors areoldmenwhohave [XX ] Preface notheoretical giftsoropenness.
