desires and establish a principle of hierarchy in the soul. The various arts present in the first city, however diverse in skill or product, all serve bodily satisfaction and are practiced for money. Ultimately� they are the same; their practitioners are all included together in what will be called the wage-earning class; although there are many differences among its members in activity and intelligence, from the decisive point of view they are the same-mere life is their goal. They do not represent any fundamental diversity of principle. The warriors' art, however, is really different, and its services cannot be measured by money, for money is a standard for evaluating the con? tributions made toward the satisfaction of desire or the� preservation of life. Spiritedness is beyond the economic system. The founders of modern economic science, who wanted it to be a universal political science, could do so only by denying the existence of spiritedness or un? derstanding it as merely a means to self-prese1vation. Only men who pursue self-preservation and the gratification of bodily desire can be counted on to act according to the principles of economic "rationality." Now there are two classes in the city, and the distinction between them is a purely natural one: one class is motivated by bodily desire, the other by spiritedness. The former can be counted on to pursue what we would call the economic goals. The latter has liberated itself from the single-minded concern for mere life. But the purposes of this class are not as yet clear. It seems that it is in the nature of spiritedness to be in the service of something, just as it is in the nature of soldiers to be in the service of something. Neither spiritedness nor the class which em? bodies it can be ends in themselves; their purposes come from outside of themselves. This class could be understood as a servant of the wage? earning class, but this would mean that the superior exists for the sake of the inferior. To understand the dignity of this element in the soul and in the city requires the discovery of a third and highest class which spiritedness serves and the end of which is as clear as that of the wage? earning class. This necessity for a third class is implied in the descrip? tion of the warriors as noble dogs who guard a flock. Sheep dogs require shepherds. The warrior class would then be the link between the highest and lowest class, gaining its meaning from its service to the higher. The parallel of city and soul would apply in this case too. However that may be, the city needs defenders, and it also now needs rulers, for its feverish desires make living together impossible without control. It is inevitable that tht spirited warriors will rule in this city, for they are strong. In every civil society, there is on group that has th.e greatest strength, and it can and always does set down the
