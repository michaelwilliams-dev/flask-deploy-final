if you got it and would also benefit your enemies if they got it. Ground of intercourse is that over which you can go and others can come. Axial ground is that which is surrounded on three sides by competing interests and would enable the first to get it to win the world. Deep ground is when you penetrate enemy territory so far that many of their cities and towns are behind you. Bad ground is mountain forests, defiles, marshes, and places generally difficult of passage. Surrounded ground is where the way in is narrow and the way out is tortuous, so even in large numbers you are vulnerable to attack by a small band. A ground of death is where you will live if you battle quickly and die if you do not battle quickly. On a ground of disintegration, therefore, do not fight. On shallow ground, do not halt. On a ground of contention, do not attack. On a ground of intercourse, do not get cut off. On axial ground, make alliances. On deep ground, plunder. On bad ground, keep going. On surrounded ground, plan ahead. On deadly ground, fight. Those known as skilled warriors of old could make it so enemies� vanguard and rear could not contact each other, large and small contingents could not rely on each other, the high and low ranks would not help each other, the leadership and the followers could not control each other, soldiers left and could not be reconvened, and troop[s] were not orderly when assembled. When it was advantageous, they acted; otherwise, they did not. It may be asked, how do you face an oncoming enemy who is massive and well ordered? First deprive him of what he likes, and he will listen. The true condition of military action is that its essential factor is speed, taking advantage of others� shortcomings, going by unexpected routes, attacking unguarded spots. The general pattern of invasion is that deep penetration results in total concentration, such that defenders cannot win. Glean from rich fields, and the armed forces will be adequately fed. Be careful of their health and do not strain them; consolidate energy and build up strength. In maneuvering troops, calculate strategy so as to be unpredictable. Put them where they have nowhere to go, and they will die before giving up. In the face of death, how can warriors not exert their strength to the utmost? When warriors are in extreme peril, they have no fear; when they have no way out, they are firm. When they have gotten in deeply, they stick to it; when they have no choice, they will fight. Thus they are watchful without being trained, enlist without being drafted, are won over without promises, are loyal without being forced. Prohibit soothsaying, eliminate what is dubious, and they will stay to the death. Our warriors have nothing extra, but not because they dislike goods; their lives are up, but not because they dislike longevity. On the day
