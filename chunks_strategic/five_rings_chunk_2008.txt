Socrates isincapable oftheanger sonecessary topolitical justice, and, therefore, canuseAdeimantus toadvantage hereandelsewhere. Adeimantus' particular form ofspiritedness, when tamed, isascourge ofinjustice, asource ofprimitive justice. (427c-445e) With theestablishment ofrules concerning thewor- shipofthegods, thecity isasserted tobecomplete andperfect. Itsper- fection must consist initsbeing theonly city inwhich therulers rule fortheadvantage oftheruled andhence oftheweaker— theexact op- posite ofThrasymachus' description ofrulers, butinaccord with Soc- [372 ] Interpretive Essay rates'andThrasymachus' jointunderstanding oftheartisan inthepre- cisesense. AtlastSocrates and hiscompanions areready tobegin the investigation forwhich alltheir previous efforts were onlytheprepara- tion.Theymustnowlook forjustice and injustice inthecityfounded intheir discourse. Socrates, attheurging ofGlaucon, whohere takes overfromAdeimantus, suggests thefollowing procedure forlocating it: since thecity isperfectly good, itmustbewise, moderate, courageous, and just; therefore, theyneed onlyrecognize initthevirtues theydo know inorder toidentify what remains asjustice. This procedure, however, isopen toseveral obvious objections. Nothing hasbeendone toestablish that these four^and only these four— virtues arewhat makes acitygood. Nor isthere anyindication thattheinterlocutors knowwhatwisdom, moderation, andcourage are,anymore thanthey know what justice is.These virtues have notbeen thematically discussed here,butweknow from other Socratic dialogues thattheyare asproblematic asjustice. But,most important ofall,Socrates, without stating anygrounds forsodoing, assumes whatheandhiscompanions had setouttoprove— thatjustice isgood. Originally thequestion was: What isjustice, and isitgood?Now ithasbecome: What good thing is justice? One iscompelled towonder whyGlaucon accepts sogreat a change without comment. Itmaybebecause Glaucon issoeager to hearwhat justice is,because heisoftheopinion thatheandtheothers arefinally attheborders ofthepromised land, thathedoes not, asit were, read thefineprint. Moreover, this ishiscity,and forthatreason alone itisgood.Common sense dictates thenotion thatjustice issome- thing thathastodowith acityand that agood citymust possess justice. Glaucon hasaccepted this cityandjustice along with it.He could hardly announce that acityhehasfounded isnotjust. However, Glaucon's original question hasnotbeen answered. In opposition toThrasymachus, hehadsuggested thatjustice means that thestrongman serves theweak totheneglect ofhisownadvantage. The lifeoftherulers inthisregime seems tosupport thatsuggestion. Fortheruled toobey therulers isstrictly totheirownadvantage since therulers arededicated tothem. Butthedoubt remains astowhether it istotherulers' advantage tocare fortheruled.Afounder, forhisown selfish reasons, maywant therulers tobejust,buthedoesnotthereby prove that itisgood forthem tobejust.Theassumption thatjustice is goodandmustbeinthecity isperfectly legitimate from thepoint of view offounders ormenwho arediscussing acity.Buttherealques- tion ispostponed until thediscussion oftheindividual: Isjustice inthe individual man thesame asthat inthecityanddoes justice inthein- [373 ] THEREPUBLIC dividual lead togood citizenship? Firstwelook attheperfected city andthen attheperfected man.Theissue isintheir relation: Canaper- fectmanbecome andremain perfect inaperfect city? Isjustice good forhim? This isidentical with thequestion: Isthecitynatural? For man,andhence thegoodman, issurely natural. Socrates and hiscompanions experience greater difficulty in discerning justice than indiscerning theother virtues. Justice, rather than faraway intheheavens, isinadark place attheir feet.Even a cursory examination ofwhat they findthere reveals thatjustice isnot necessary inthis city.This isnottoosurprising, forthecitycame into being without justice being included inthespecific waythatcourage, moderation, andwisdom were included. Indeed, when defined aseach mandoing hisjoborminding hisownbusiness, justice addsnothing to thecitythat isnotaccomplished bytheother three virtues. The city needs wisemen tocommand; itneeds courageous men toovercome resistance tothewisecommands; and itneeds moderation tobind the citytogether intoawhole andmaintain theproper hierarchy ofits parts. Butwhere does thatleave justice? Justice disappears here, even asitdidwhen Polemarchus asserted thatjustice consists ofdoing good tofriends, only todiscover that itisthevarious artsthatdogood to men.Thisseemed unsatisfactory because ofthefactthattheartscando harm aswell asgood— adoctor can killaswell ascure— sothatsome- thingmore than thearts isrequired. Butnow itappears that itisnot justice which isnecessary tosupplement thearts;theyneed onlybelong totheproper order orwhole. Iftherulers
