The$50,000 remained inthebank box untouched. Lustigmade noef- fort todouble it.Two months later heretumed toChicago, took themoney from thebox, andpaid Capone another visit. Helooked atthegangstefs stony~faced bodyguards,smiled apologetically,andsaid, “Pleaseaccept my profound regrets,Mr.Capone. I’msorrytoreportthat theplan failed . . .I failed.” Capone slowlystoodup.Heglowered atLustig, debating which part oftheriver tothrow him in.But the count reached into hiscoat pocket, withdrew the$50,000, andplaced itonthedesk. “Here, sir,isyour money, tothe penny. Again, my sincere apologies. This ismost embarrassing. Things didn’t work outthewayIthought theywould. Iwould have loved tohave doubledyour moneyforyouand formyself»-—Lord knows Ineed it--but theplanjustdidn’t materialize.” Capone sagged back into hischair, confused. “Iknow you’reacon man, Count,” saidCapone.“Iknew itthemoment youwalked inhere. I expected either onehundred thousand dollars ornothing.Butthis . ..get- ting mymoneyback . . .well.” “Again myapologies, MLCapone,”said Lustig,ashepicked uphishatandbegan toleave. “MyGod! You’re hon- est!” yelled Capone. “Ifyou’reonthespot,here’s five tohelp youalong.” He counted out five one—thousand~dollar bills out ofthe$50,000. The count seemed stunned, bowed deeply, mumbled histhanks, andleft, tak- ingthemoney. The $5,000 was what Lustig had been after allalong. Interpretation Count Victor Lustig,aman who spoke several languages andpridedhim- self onhisrefinement andculture, was oneofthegreatcon arfists ofmod- ern times. He was known forhisaudacity,hisfearlessness, and, most important,hisknowledge ofhuman psychology.Hecould sizeupaman in minutes, discovering hisweaknesses, and hehad radar forsuckers. Lustig knew that most men buildupdefenses against crooks and other trouble- makers. The conartists jobistobringthose defenses down. One sure way todothis isthroughanactofapparent sincerityand honesty. Who will distrust aperson literally caught inthe actofbeinghon- est?Lustigused selective honesty many times, butwith Capone hewent a stepfurther. Nonormal con man would have dared such acon; hewould have chosen hissuckers fortheir meekness, forthatlook about them that saysthey will take their medicine without complaint. Con Capone andyou would spendthe rest ofyourlife(whatever remained ofit)afraid. But Lustig understood that aman likeCapone spendshisliferrfistrusting oth- ers.No one around him ishonest orgenerous,andbeingsomuch inthe company ofwolves isexhausting,even depressing. Aman likeCapone yearnstobetherecipient ofanhonest orgenerous gesture,tofeelthat not everyonehas anangleorisout torobhim. Lusiig’sactofselective honestydisarmed Caponebecause itwas so unexpected.Acon artist loves conflictingemotions like these, since the person caught upinthem issoeasily distracted and deceived. Donotshyawayfrom practicingthislaw ontheCaponesoftheworld. With awell-timed gesture ofhonestyorgenerosity, youwillhave themost brutal andcynicalbeast inthekingdom eatingoutofyourhand.
