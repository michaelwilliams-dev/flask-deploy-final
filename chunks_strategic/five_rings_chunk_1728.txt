and that hetherefore could not consummate hislove, hedespairedand drowned himself. Allofushave asimilar prob- lem: We areprofoundlyinlove with ourselves, but since thislove excludes alove objectoutside ourselves, itremains continuouslyunsatisfied and un- fulfilled. The Narcissus Effect playsonthis universal narcissism: You look deep into thesouls ofother people;fathom their inmost desires, their val- ues, their tastes, their spirit;andyou reflect itback tothem, making your- selfinto akind ofmirror image. Your abilitytoreflect theirpsyche gives yougreat powerover them; they mayeven feel atinge oflove. This issimplytheabilitytomimic anotherpersonnotphysically,but psychologically,and itisimmensely powerfulbecause itplays uponthe unsatisfied se1f—love ofachild. Normally, people bombard uswith their ex- periences,their tastes. They hardlyever make theeffort to seethings throughoureyes.This isannoying, butitalso creates great opportunity:If youcan show youunderstand anotherperson byreflectingtheir inmost feelings, they will beentranced and disarmed, allthe more sobecause it happenssorarely. No one can resist thisfeeling ofbeing harmoniouslyre- flected intheoutside world, even though youmightwell bemanufacturing itfor their benefit, andfordeceptive purposes ofyourown. The Narcissus Effect works wonders inboth social lifeandbusiness; it givesusboth theSeducer’s and theCoum'er’s Mirror. The Moral Effect. Thepower ofverbal argument isextremely limited, and often accomplishestheopposite ofwhat isintended. AsGracién re- marks, “The truth isgenerally seen, rarelyheard.” The Moral Effect isa perfect way todemonstrate yourideas through action. Quite simply, you teach others alesson bygivingthem ataste oftheir own medicine. IntheMoral Effect, youmirror what other peoplehave done toyou, and do soinawaythat makes them realize youaredoing tothem exactly what they did toyou.You make them feelthat their behavior hasbeen un- pleasant,asopposedtohearing youcomplainand whine about it,which only gets their defensesup.And astheyfeeltheresult oftheir actions mir~ rored back atthem, theyrealize intheprofoundestsense how theyhurt or punishothers with their unsocial behavior. Youobjectifythequalifies you want them tofeelashamed ofand create amirror inwhich theycangazeat their follies and learn alesson about themselves. This techniqueisoften used byeducators, psychologists,andanyonewho has todeal with un- pleasantand unconscious behavior. This istheTeacher’s Mirror. Vifhether ornotthere isactually anything wrong with thewaypeoplehave treated you, however, itcanoften betoyour advantage toreflect itback tothem in awaythat makes them feelguiltyabout it. TheHallucinatory Effect. Mirrors aretremendously deceptive, forthey create asense thatyouarelookingatthereal world. Actually, though, you areonly staringatapiece ofglass, which,aseveryone knows, cannot show theworld exactlyasitis:Everythinginamirror isreversed. When Alice goesthroughthelooking glass inLewis Ca.rroll’s book, she enters aworld that isback~to—front, and more thanjustvisually. TheHallucinatoryEffect comes from creatingaperfect copy ofanob- ject,aplace,aperson.Thiscopyacts asakind ofdummy—-people take it fortherealthing,because ithasthephysical appearance oftherealthing. This isthepreeminent technique ofcon artists, who strategicallymimic the real world todeceive you. Italso hasapplicationsinanyarena that re quires camouflage.This istheDeceiver’s Mirror.

Thecountrywas devastated, hehad noalliesamongtheother European nations, and hismost loyal andimportantministers had deserted him or leftthecountry. Onlyone man remained from theoldregin-ie—joseph Fouché, hisformer minister ofpolice. Napoleonhad relied onFouché todohisdirtywork throughouthis previous reign,but hehad never been able tofigurehisminister out. He keptacorps ofagents tospyonallofhisministers, sothat hewould always have anedgeonthem, but no one hadgotten anythingonFouché.
