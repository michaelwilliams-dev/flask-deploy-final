be conquered by ruse, by force, or by both; through a sea of warlikeIndians who ate their prisoners and donned their skins as trophies; at thestroke of their chief's masterly hand, the five hundred men had lost that flowof vital memories and hopes which linked up their souls with their mother-island; at one stroke, their backs had been withered and had lost all sense oflife. Henceforward, for them, all life was ahead, towards those forbiddingpeaks which rose gigantically on the horizon as if to bar all access to whatwas now not merely their ambition, but their only possible aim--Mexico,mysterious and powerful behind the conflicting tribes.HERNAN CORTES: CONQUEROR OF MEXICO, SALVADOR DEMADARIAGA, 1942THE NO-RETURN TACTICIn 1504 an ambitious nineteen-year-old Spaniard named Hernan Cortes gave uphis studies in law and sailed for his country's colonies in the New World.Stopping first in Santo Domingo (the island today comprising Haiti and theDominican Republic), then in Cuba, he soon heard about a land to the westcalled Mexico--an empire teeming with gold and dominated by the Aztecs, with their magnificent highland capital of Tenochtitlan. From then on, Cortes had justone thought: someday he would conquer and settle the land of Mexico.Over the next ten years, Cortes slowly rose through the ranks, eventuallybecoming secretary to the Spanish governor of Cuba and then the king's treasurerfor the island. In his own mind, though, he was merely biding his time. Hewaited patiently while Spain sent other men to Mexico, many of them never toreturn.Finally, in 1518, the governor of Cuba, Diego de Velazquez, made Cortes theleader of an expedition to discover what had happened to these earlier explorers,find gold, and lay the groundwork for the country's conquest. Velazquez wantedto make that future conquest himself, however, so for this expedition he wanteda man he could control, and he soon developed doubts about Cortes--the manwas clever, perhaps too much so. Word reached Cortes that the governor washaving second thoughts about sending him to Mexico. Deciding to giveVelazquez no time to nurse his misgivings, he managed to slip out of Cuba in themiddle of the night with eleven ships. He would explain himself to the governorlater.The expedition landed on Mexico's east coast in March 1519. Over the nextfew months, Cortes put his plans to work--founding the town of Veracruz,forging alliances with local tribes who hated the Aztecs, and making initialcontact with the Aztec emperor, whose capital lay some 250 miles to the west.But one problem plagued the conquistador: among the 500 soldiers who hadsailed with him from Cuba were a handful who had been placed there byVelazquez to act as spies and make trouble for him if he exceeded his authority.These Velazquez loyalists accused Cortes of mismanaging the gold that he wascollecting, and when it became clear that he intended to conquer Mexico, theyspread rumors that he was insane--an all-too-convincing accusation to makeabout a man planning to lead 500 men against half a million Aztecs, fiercewarriors known to eat their prisoners' flesh and wear the skins as trophies.
