Sothey turned tothe sea,establishing colonies inAsia Minor, Sicily,theItalian peninsula,even Africa. The city-state ofSparta, however, was landlocked and surrounded bymountains. Lackingaccess tothe Mediterranean, theSpartansnever became aseafaring people; instead theyturned onthe cities around them, and, inaseries ofbrutal, violent conflicts lastingmore than ahundredyears, managedtoconqueranim- mense area that would provide enough land fortheir citizens. This solution totheir problem, however, broughtanew, more formidable one: How could theymaintain andpolicetheir conqueredterritories? The subordi- nate peoples theyruled now outmimbered them ten toone.Surelythis horde would take ahorriblerevengeonthem. Sparta’ssolution was tocreate asociety dedicated tothe artofwar. Spartanswould betougher, stronger,and fiercer than their neighbors. This was theonly waythey could ensure their stabilityand survival. When aSpartan boy reached theageofseven, he was taken from his mother andplacedinamilitary club where hewas trained tofightand un- derwent thestrictest discipline.Theboys sleptonbeds ofreeds; theywere allotted onlyone outer garment towear for anentireyear. They studied none ofthearts; indeed, theSpartansbanned music, andpermitted only slaves topracticethecrafts that were necessarytosustain them. Theonly skills theSpartans taught were those ofwarfare. Children seen asweaklings were left todieinacavern inthemountains. Nosystem ofmoneyortrad- ingwas allowed inSparta; acquired wealth, they believed, would sow self- ishness anddissension, weakeningtheir warrior discipline.Theonly waya Spartan could earn alivingwasthrough agriculture, mostlyonstate—owned lands, which slaves, called helots, would work forhim. TheSpartans’ single-mindedness allowed them toforgethe mostpow- erful infantryintheworld. Theymarched inperfectorder andfoughtwith incomparable bravery.Their tighbknit phalamxes could vanquishanarmy tentimes their size, asthey provedindefeating thePersians atThermopy- lae. ASpartancolumn onthemarch would strike terror intheenemy;it seemed tohave noweaknesses. Yetalthough theSpartans provedthem~ selves mighty warriors, theyhad nointerest increatinganempire. They only wanted tokeepwhat they hadalready conqueredand todefend it against invaders. Decades wouldpasswithout asingle changeinthesystem that had succeeded sowell inpreserving Spa.rta’sstatusquo. Atthe same time that theSpartanswere evolving their warlike culture, anothercity—statewasrisingtoequal prominence:Athens, Unlike Sparta, Athens had taken tothe sea, not somuch tocreate colonies asforpurposes oftrade. The Athenians became great merchants; theircurrency,the fa- mous “owl coins,” spread throughout theMediterranean. Unlike therigid Spartans,theAthenians respondedtoevery problem with consummate creativity, adaptingtotheoccasion andcreatingnew social forms and new arts
