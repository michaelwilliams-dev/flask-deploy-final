by his master. His lack of progress made him feel desperate, so he told himself, in all seriousness, �If I fail to master one of these koans in seven days, I will kill myself.� This worked for him and kept on working for him, until he attained total enlightenment. As you progress on your path, you will be subject to more and more of people�s criticisms. Some of them might be constructive and worth paying attention to, but many of them come from envy. You can recognize the latter by the person�s emotional tone in expressing their negative opinions.

He was able to instill in her the confidence that she could become a famous designer. He taught her about business in general. He offered her tough criticisms that she could accept because of her deep respect for him. He helped guide her in her first important decisions in setting up her business. From him she developed a very honed sense of purpose that she retained her entire life. Without his influence, her path would have been too confusing and difficult. Later in life, she kept returning to this strategy. She found other men and women who had skills she lacked or needed to strengthen�social graciousness, marketing, a
