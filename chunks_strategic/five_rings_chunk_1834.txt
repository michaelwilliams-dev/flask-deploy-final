chosen fitthenature ofSocrates' interlocutor; inorder toseethewhole problem, thereader mustponder notonly thedistinction ofthekinds ofknowing andbeing but itsparticular effect onGlaucon andwhat Soc- ratesmight have said toanother man.One isnever allowed tositand xxu Preface passively receive thewords ofwisdom from themouth ofthemaster. And thismeans thatthetranslation must, insofar ashumanly possible, present allthenuances oftheoriginal— theoaths, therepetitions of words, theslight changes inthefonn ofresponses, etc.— sothatthe reader canlook attheprogress ofthedrama with alltheperceptiveness andsharpness ofwhich hisnature permits him,which hewould bring tobearonanyrealsituation which concerned him.Thetranslator can- nothope tohaveunderstood itall,buthemust notbegrudge hispossi- blemoral andintellectual superiors their possibility ofinsight. Itisin thename ofthisduty thatonerisks theridiculousness ofpedan tryin preserving theuncomfortable details which force asacrifice ofthe easygoing charms ofamore contemporary style. Ihave used theOxford textoftheRepublic, edited byJohn Burnet. Ihave deviated from itonly rarely and intheimportant instances havemade mention ofitinthenotes. Always atmyhand was, ofcourse, James Adam's valuable commentary (New York:Cambridge University Press, 1963). Schleiermacher's oldGerman version wasthe most useful translation Ifound. Although histextwas inferior toours, heseems tohavehadthebestgrasp ofthecharacter andmeaning ofthe dialogues. Robin's French isalso quite careful. The best English translations arePaul Shorey's (Loeb) andA.D.Lindsay's (Every- man's). The latter isprobably themore useful ofthetwobecause itis sounpretentious andstraightforward. Thenotes arenotintended tobeinterpretive butmerely topre- sentnecessary information thereader could notbeexpected toknow, explain difficulties intranslation, present themeaning ofcertain key terms, and,above all,givetheknown sources forthecitations from other authors andthechanges Platomakes inthem.Thedialogue isso rich inconnections withother Platonic works andtherestofclassical literature that itwould beimpossible tobegin tosupply even themost important. Moreover, itisthereader's jobtodiscover these things him- self,notonlybecause itisgood forhimbutalsobecause theeditor might verywellbewrong inhisemphases. The text isasmuch aspossi- blePlato's, tobeconfronted directly bythereader. 1have savedmy ownopinions fortheinterpretive essay. Theindex isalsointended to serve asaglossary; itscategories aredrawn onlyfrom Plato's usage and notfromcontemporary interests orproblems. Whatever merit thistranslation mayhave isdue inlargemeasure tothehelpofSethBenardete andWernerJ.Dannhauser. Theformer gavemeunsparingly ofhisimmense classical learning andinsight; the latterwasalmost unbelievably generous with histimeandbrought his sensitivity andsound judgment totheentire manuscript. Iamalso [xxiii] Preface grateful toRalphLemer forhissuggestions after athorough reading of the text.Walter F.Bems, Jr.,Richard H.Kennington, andMyron Rushwere very helpful with theintroduction. Iwish tothankmystu- dents,whowere the firsttousethetranslation intheir studies; par- ticularly Games Lord, James Nichols, andMarc Plattner fortheir sug- gestions anddetection ofomissions and errors. Mr.Plattner alsodid thebulkoftheworkontheindexanddeserves thecredit forthisuseful addition tomytranslation. The interpretive essay relies heavily on Leo Strauss' authoritative discussion oftheRepublic inTheCityand Man (Chicago: Rand McNally, 1964).
