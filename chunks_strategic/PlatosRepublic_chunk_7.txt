always be good or just, for example, Achilles' wrath. There is further matter for reflection here: one might learn a great deal if one could follow such problems throughout Plato's works. It is only in this way that a student might reconstructa plausible and profound Platonic view of the world rather than find the dialogues a compendium of unconvincing platitudes. F. M. Cornford, whose translation is now the one most widely used' ridicules literal translation and insists that it is often "... misleading, or tedious, or grotesque and silly, or pompous and verbose" (The Republic [New York: Oxford University Press, 1956], p. v.). I doubt that it is often misleading, although I acJviit that it may often lack the beauty of the original. The issue is whether a certain si2urious charm-for it is not Plato's charm-is worth the loss of awareness of Plato's problems necessitated by Comford's notions about translation. It is only because he did not see the extent of the loss that he could be so cavalier with the original. He made a rather heavy joke at the ex? pense of an earlier translator: One who opened Jowett's version at random and lighted on the state? ment (at 549B) that the best guardian for a man's "virtue" is "philosophy tempered with music," might run away with the idea that in order to avoid irregular relations with women, he had better play the violin in the intervals of studying metaphysics. There may be some truth in this; but only after reading widely in other parts of the book would he discover that it was not quite what Plato meant by describing logos, combined with musike, as the only sure safe? guard of arete (ibid., p. vi.). But no matter how widely one reads in Cornford's translation, one cannot clarify this sentence or connect it with the �general problems developed throughout the Republic; for the only possible sources of clarification or connection, the original terms, have disappeared and have been replaced by a sentence meaningless in itself and unillumined by the carefully prepared antecedents which were in? tended to give the thought special significance. Corriford's version reads as follows, ". . . his character is not thoroughly sound, for lack of the only safeguard that can preserve it throughout life, a thoughtful and cultivated mind." A literal rendering would be " '. . . [he is] not pure in his attachment to virtue, having been abandoned by the best guardian .. .' 'What's that?' Adeimantus said. 'Argument [or speech or reason] mixed with music... .'" There is n9 doubt that one can read the sentence as it appears in Cornford without being drawn up short, without being puzzled. But this is only because it says nothi g. It uses commonplace terms� which have no precise significance; it is the kind of sentence one finds in newspaper editorials. From having been shocking or incomprehensible, Plato becomes boring. There is no food for reflection here. Virtue has become character. But virtue has
