chapter should be singled out, however, is not clear. CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 11 and Autumn" or the beginning of the "Warring States" period.24 The story that his precepts were actually applied by the Wu State, is merely the out- come of big talk on the part of his followers. From the flourishing period of the Chou dynasty25 down to the time of the "Spring and Autumn," all military commanders were statesmen as well, and the class of professional generals, for conducting external campaigns, did not then exist. It was not until the period of the "Six States"26 that this custom changed. Now although Wu was an uncivilized State, it is conceivable that Tso should have left unrecorded the fact that Sun Wu was a great general and yet held no civil office? What we are told, therefore, about Jang-chu 27 and Sun Wu, is not authentic matter, but the reckless fabrication of theorizing pundits. The story of Ho Lu�s experiment on the women, in particular, is utterly preposterous and incredible. Yeh Shui-hsin represents Ssu-ma Ch�ien as having said that Sun Wu crushed Ch�u and entered Ying. This is not quite correct. No doubt the impression left on the reader�s mind is that he at least shared in these exploits. The fact may or may not be significant; but it is nowhere explicitly stated in the SHIH CHI either that Sun Tzu was general on the occasion of the taking of Ying, or that he even went there at all. Moreover, as we know that Wu Yuan and Po P�ei both took part in the expedition, and also that its success was largely due to the dash and enterprise of Fu Kai, Ho Lu�s younger brother, it is not easy to see how yet another general could have played a very prominent part in the same campaign. Ch�en Chen-sun of the Sung dynasty has the note: Military writers look upon Sun Wu as the father of their art. But the fact that he does not appear in the TSO CHUAN, although he is said to have served under Ho Lu King of Wu, makes it uncertain what period he really belonged to. He also says: The works of Sun Wu and Wu Ch�i may be of genuine antiquity. It is noticeable that both Yeh Shui-hsin and Ch�en Chen-sun, while rejecting the per- sonality of Sun Wu as he figures in Ssu-ma Ch�ien�s history, are inclined to accept the date traditionally assigned to the work which passes under his name. The author of the HSU LU fails to appreciate this distinction, and consequently his bitter attack on Ch�en Chen-sun really misses its mark. He makes one of two points, however, which certainly tell in favor of the high antiquity of our "13 chapters." "Sun Tzu," he says, 24About 480 B.C. 25That is, I suppose, the age of Wu Wang and Chou Kung. 26In the 3rd century B.C. 27Ssu-ma Jang-chu, whose family name was T�ien, lived in the latter half of the 6th
