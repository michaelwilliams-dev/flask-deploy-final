"Could youreally persuade," hesaid, "ifwedon't listen?" "There's noway," saidGlaucon. "Well, then, think itover, bearing inmindwewon't listen." 328a ThenAdeimantus said, "Is itpossible youdon'tknow that atsun- setthere willbeatorch raceonhorseback forthegoddess?" "Onhorseback?" Isaid. "That isnovel. Will theyhold torches andpassthem tooneanother while racing thehorses, orwhatdoyou mean?" "That's it,"saidPolemarchus, "and, besides, they'll putonanall- night festival thatwillbeworth seeing. We'll getupafterdinner andgo tosee it;there we'llbetogether withmany oftheyoungmenandwe'll b talk.SostayanddoasItellyou." AndGlaucon said, "Itseemswemust stay." "Well, ifitissoresolved,"^ Isaid, "that's howwemust act." Thenwewent toPolemarchus' home; therewefound Lysias'^ and Euthydemus, Polemarchus' brothers, and, inaddition, Thrasymachus,^ theChalcedonian andCharmantides, thePaeanian,^ and Cleito- phonji** thesonofAristonymus. Cephalus,!! Polemarchus' father, was also athome; andhe c seemed veryoldtome,forIhadnotseenhim forsome time.Hewas seated onasortofcushioned stoolandwascrowned with awreath, for hehadjustperformed asacrifice inthecourtyard. Wesatdown beside him, forsome stools were arranged inacircle there. Assoon asCeph- alussawme,hegreeted mewarmly and said: "Socrates, youdon'tcomedown tousinthePiraeus very often, yetyouought to.Now ifIstillhadthestrength tomake thetripto town easily, therewould benoneed foryou tocome here; rather we d would come toyou.As itis,however, youmustcome heremore fre- quently.

"Formypart, Cephalus, Iamreally delighted todiscuss with the e very old," Isaid. "Since they arelikemenwhohaveproceeded ona certain road thatperhaps wetoowillhave totake,oneought, inmy opinion, tolearn fromthemwhat sortofroad itisâ€”^whether itisrough andhard oreasyandsmooth. From youinparticular Ishould liketo learnhow itlooks toyou, foryouarenow atjustthetime oflifethe [4] Book 11327c-330a socrates/cephalus poets call'thethreshold ofoldage.''^ isitahardtime oflife,orwhat 328c haveyoutoreport ofit?" "ByZeus, Ishall tellyoujusthow itlooks tome, Socrates," he said."Some ofuswho areabout thesame ageoftenmeet together and 329a keepuptheoldproverb.'^^Now then,when theymeet, most ofthe members ofourgroup lament, longing forthepleasures ofyouth and reminiscing about sex,about drinking bouts andfeasts and allthatgoes with things ofthat sort;they take ithard asthough theywere deprived ofsomething veryimportant andhadthen lived wellbutarenownot even alive.Some alsobewail theabuse that oldagereceives from b relatives, andinthiskeythey sing arefrain about alltheevils oldage hascaused them. But, Socrates, inmyopinion thesemendonotput their fingers onthecause. For, ifthiswere thecause, Itoowould have suffered these same things insofar astheydepend onoldageandso would everyone elsewhohascome tothispoint inlife.But asitis,I haveencountered others forwhom itwasnotso,especially Sophocles. I wasonce present when thepoetwasasked bysomeone, 'Sophocles, how areyou insex?Canyou stillhave intercourse with awoman?' c 'Silence, man,' hesaid. 'Most joyfully did Iescape it,asthough Ihad runaway from asortoffrenzied andsavage master.' Ithought atthe time thathehadspoken welland Istilldo.For, inevery way, oldage brings great peace andfreedom from such things. When thedesires cease tostrain and finally relax, thenwhat Sophocles sayscomes topass inevery way; itispossible toberidofverymanymad masters. Butof d these things andofthose thatconcern relatives, there isone just cause: notoldage, Socrates, butthecharacter ofthehuman beings.^4 Ifthey areorderly andcontent with themselves, ^^even oldage isonly moderately troublesome; ifthey arenot,thenboth age, Socrates, and youth alike turnouttobehard forthat sort." Then Iwas fullofwonder atwhathesaidand,wanting him tosay stillmore, Istirred him up,saying: "Cephalus, when yousaythese e things, Isuppose thatthemanyi^ donotaccept them from you,but believe rather that itisnotdue tocharacter thatyoubear oldageso easily butdue topossessing great substance. They saythat fortherich there aremany consolations.' "What yousay istrue," hesaid."They donotaccept them.And theydohavesomething there, butnot,however, quite asmuch
