that the 13 chapters existed in the time of Ssu-ma Ch�ien practically as we have them now. That the work was then well known he tells us in so many words. "Sun Tzu�s 13 Chapters and Wu Ch�i�s Art of War are the two books that people commonly refer to on the subject of military matters. Both of them are widely distributed, so I will not discuss them here." But as we go further back, serious difficulties begin to arise. The salient fact which has to be faced is that the TSO CHUAN, the greatest contemporary record, makes no mention whatsoever of Sun Wu, either as a general or as a writer. It is natural, in view of this awkward circumstance, that many scholars should not only cast doubt on the story of Sun Wu as given in the SHIH CHI, but even show themselves frankly skeptical as to the existence of the man at all. The most powerful presentment of this side of the case is to be found in the following disposition by Yeh Shui-hsin:16 It is stated in Ssu-ma Ch�ien�s history that Sun Wu was a native of the Ch�i State, and employed by Wu; and that in the reign of Ho Lu he crushed Ch�u, entered Ying, and was a great general. But in Tso�s Commentary no Sun Wu appears at all. It is true that Tso�s Commentary need not contain absolutely everything that other histories contain. But Tso has not omitted to mention vulgar plebeians and hireling ruffians such as Ying K�ao-shu,17 Ts�ao Kuei,18, Chu Chih-wu and Chuan She-chu19. In the case of Sun Wu, whose fame and achievements were so brilliant, the omission is much more glaring. Again, details are given, in their due order, about his con- temporaries Wu Yuan and the Minister P�ei.20 Is it credible that Sun Wu alone should have been passed over? In point of literary style, Sun Tzu�s work belongs to the same school as KUAN TZU,21 LIU T�AO,22 and the YUEH YU23 and may have been the production of some private scholar living towards the end of the "Spring the case of very short works, one is tempted to think that P�IEN might simply mean "leaves." 16Yeh Shih of the Sung dynasty [1151-1223]. 17He hardly deserves to be bracketed with assassins. 18See Chapter 7, ss. 27 and Chapter 11, ss. 28. 19See Chapter 11, ss. 28.
