Today,inaworld inundated withpresence throughtheflood ofimages,the gameofwithdrawal isallthe more powerful.Werarely know when to withdraw anymore,andnothingseems private,sowe areawed byanyone who isable todisappear bychoice. Novelists J.D.Salinger and Thomas Pynchonhave created cultlike followings byknowing when todisappear. Another, more everydayside ofthislaw, but one that demonstrates itstruth even further, isthelaw ofscarcityinthe science ofeconomics. Bywithdrawing something from themarket, youcreate instant value. In seventeenth-century Holland, theupperclasses wanted tomake thetulip more thanjustabeautiful flower——they wanted ittobeakind ofstatussym~ bol.Makingtheflower scarce, indeed almost impossibletoobtain, they sparkedwhat was later called tulipomania. Asingle flower was now worth more than itsweightingold.Inour own century, similarly,theartdealer JosephDuveen insisted onmakingthepaintingshesold asscarce and rare aspossible.Tokeeptheir priceselevated andtheir status high, hebought up whole collections and stored them inhisbasement. Thepaintings that he sold became more thanjustpaintings-—t.heywere fetish objects,their value increased bytheir rarity.“You cangetallthepictures youwant atfifty thou- sand dollars apiece~—-that’s easy,”he once said. “But togetpicturesata quarter ofamillion apiece—thatwants doing!” IIn age: The Sun. Itcanonlybe appreciated byitsabsence. The longerthedays ofrain, the more the sun iscraved. But toomany hotdaysand the sun overwhelms. Learn tokeep yourself obscure and make people demand yourreturn Extend thelawofscarcitytoyourown skills. Make whatyouareoffer- ingtheworld rare and hard tofind, andyouinstantlyincrease itsvalue. There alwayscomes amoment when those inpower overstaytheir welcome. Wehavegrowntired ofthem, lostrespect forthem;we seethem asnodifferent from therestofmankind, which istosaythat we seethem as rather worse, since weinevitably compare their current status inoureyes totheir former one. There isanarttoknowing when toretire. Ifitisdone right, youregain therespect youhadlost, and retain apartofyour power. The greatestruler ofthesixteenth centurywas Charles V.King of Spain, Hapsburg emperor,hegovernedanempirethat atonepointin- clucled much ofEuropeand theNew World. Yet attheheight ofhispower, in1557, heretired tothemonastery ofYuste. AllofEuropewascaptivated byhissudden withdrawal; peoplewho had hated anti feared himsuddenly called him great, and hecame tobeseen asasaint. Inmore recent times, thefilm actress Greta Garbo was never more admired than when she re tired, in1941, For some herabsence came too soon—sl1e was inhermid- thirties—but shewisely preferredtoleave onher own terms, rather than waitingforheraudience togrow tired ofher. Make yourselftooavailable and the aura ofpower youhave created around yourself will wearaway.Turn thegamearound: Make yourself less accessible andyouincrease thevalue ofyour presence. Authority: Use absence tocreate respect and esteem. Ifpresence diminishes fame, absence augments it. Aman who when absent isregardedasa lion becomes when present somethingcom- mon and ridiculous. Talents lose their luster ifwebecome too familiar with them, forthe outer shell ofthemind ismore readilyseen than itsrich inner kernel. Even the outstand« inggenius makes useofretirement sothat menmay honor him and sothat the yearning aroused byhis absence maycause him tobeesteemed. (Baltasar Grecian, l60lvl658) LAW 16 I21 REVERSAL This lawonly appliesonce acertain level ofpowerhasbeen attained. The need towithdraw onlycomes afteryou have established your presence; leave tooearlyandyoudonotincreaseyour respect, youaresimplyfor- gotten. Whenyouarefirstenteringonto theworld’:stage,create animage that isrecognizable, reproducible,and isseen everywhere. Until that status isattained, absence isdangerous—instead offarmingtheflames, itwill ex- tinguish them. Inlove and seduction, similarly, absence isonlyeffective onceyou have surrounded theother withyour image,been seen byhim orher everywhere. Everythingmust remind yourlover ofyour presence,sothat when you dochoose tobeaway, thelover willalwaysbethinkingofyou, willalways beseeing youinhisorhermind’seye. Remember: Inthebeginning, make yourselfnot scarce but om- nipresent. Onlywhat isseen, appreciated,and loved will bemissed inits absence. 17 KEEP OTHERS IN SUSPENDED TERROR: CULTIVATE ANAIR OF UNPREDICTABILITY _]UDGMENT Humans arecreatures ofhabit with aninsatiabte need to seefamiliarity inotherpeople’sactions.
