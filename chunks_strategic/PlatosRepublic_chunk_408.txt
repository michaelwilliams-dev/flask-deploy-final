the typical Socratic question, and no answer can be given to it in the Platonic context unless all the' subtle and various uses of the word itself be followed throughout the work. Contemporary usage has narrowed the sense of the word, but we still can grasp its broader meaning. If we fail to recognize that our understanding of virtue is different from the classical view, we cannot become aware of the very great change in moral understanding that has oc? curred. The moral sense� of virtue can only be developed in relation to its larger sense, and, thus, it is no accident that Socrates' first use of the word is in relation to horses. Arete will always be rendered as "virtue" throughout this translation. Any other procedure would simply render the problem posed by the word invisible. 14. Bias and Pittacus were among the semilegendary "Seven Wise Men." Many wise sayings are attributed to them. Simonides, the source of Polemarchus' definition of justice, was a poet, aptly described by Lessing as "the Greek Voltaire." 15. Periander was a sixth-century tyrant of Corinth [usually counted among the "Seven Wise Men," but not by Socrates (Protagoras, 343a)]. Per? diccas II was king of Macedonia, father of Archelaus (Gorgias, 471b). Xerxes was the Persian king who led the great expedition against Greece. Ismenias the Theban is not well known, but he is mentioned at Meno, 90a, and it is prob? ably the same Ismenias to whom Xenophon refers (Hellenica, III, 5, 1-2). He is the only one of these four who was not a monarch. He seems to have been excessively fond of money and to have sold his services to the Persians at a date later than the supposed date (411 B.c.) of the action of the Republic]. 16. There was a popular belief in antiquity that if a wolf sees a man first, the man is struck speechless. 17. Cf. Apology, 38b. This whole scene is a parody of judicial pro? cedure, in which the defendant proposes his own punishment in opposition to the accuser. The rhetorician plays the accuser, and thereby shows how his skills can be of use (cf. Aristophanes, Clouds). Plato, contrary to the im? pression Aristophanes wishes to give, presents Socrates as innocent of judicial rhetoric; rather it is his opponent who knows that powerful and dangerous art. 18. This is a translation of the word kreitton, which means "stronger"; however, its use was also expanded to cover all sorts of superiority, and it finally could mean even goodness or excellence. Here the sense is clear, but Plato also plays on a certain popular confusion as to what really constitutes ex- cel1ence. The first use of the word occurred at 327c and prefigur Thrasyma? chus' argument that the stronger should rule and are the standards for justice: 14. Pancration was a combination of wrestling and boxing. � . � � 15. In modem times the word sycophant has come to mean on]y a "flat? terer," especially of
