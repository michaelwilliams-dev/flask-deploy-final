Most of the large Chinese encyclopedias contain extensive sections devoted to the literature of war. The following references may be found useful: T�UNG TIEN (circa 800 A.D.), ch. 148-162. T�AI P�ING YU LAN (983), ch. 270-359. WEN HSIEN TUNG K�AO (13th cent.), ch. 221. YU HAI (13th cent.), ch. 140, 141. SAN TS�AI T�U HUI (16th cent). KUANG PO WU CHIH (1607), ch. 31, 32. CH�IEN CH�IO LEI SHU (1632), ch. 75. YUAN CHIEN LEI HAN (1710), ch. 206-229. KU CHIN T�U SHU CHI CH�ENG (1726), section XXX, esp. ch. 81- 90. HSU WEN HSIEN T�UNG K�AO (1784), ch. 121-134. HUANG CH�AO CHING SHIH WEN PIEN (1826), ch. 76, 77. The bibliographical sections of certain historical works also deserve mention: BIBLIOGRAPHY 28 CH�IEN HAN SHU, ch. 30. SUI SHU, ch. 32-35. CHIU T�ANG SHU, ch. 46, 47. HSIN T�ANG SHU, ch. 57,60. SUNG SHIH, ch. 202-209. T�UNG CHIH (circa 1150), ch. 68. To these of course must be added the great Catalogue of the Imperial Library: SSU K�U CH�UAN SHU TSUNG MU T�I YAO (1790), ch. 99, 100. The previously mentioned works are the oldest Chinese treatises on war, after Sun Tzu. The notes on each have been drawn principally from the SSU K�U CH�UAN SHU CHIEN MING MU LU, ch. 9, fol. 22 sqq. Chapter 2 LAYING PLANS [Ts�ao Kung, in defining the meaning of the Chinese for the title of this chapter, says it refers to the deliberations in the temple selected by the general for his temporary use, or as we should say, in his tent. See. ss. 26.] 1. Sun Tzu said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State. 2. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected. 3. The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one�s deliberations, when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field. 4. These are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The Com- mander; (5) Method and discipline. [It appears from what follows that Sun Tzu means by "Moral Law" a prin- ciple of harmony, not unlike the Tao of Lao Tzu in its moral aspect. One might be tempted to render it by "morale," were it not considered as an attribute of the ruler in ss. 13.] 5. , 6. The MORAL LAW causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger. [Tu Yu quotes Wang Tzu as saying: "Without constant practice, the officers will be nervous and undecided when mustering for battle; without constant practice, the general will be wavering and irresolute when the crisis is at hand."] 7. HEAVEN signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons. [The commentators, I think, make an unnecessary mystery of two words here. Meng
