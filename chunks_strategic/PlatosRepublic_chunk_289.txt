and one's own is made, the principle of loyalty to family and city is undermined. In order to be just, one must seek good men wherever they may be, even in nations fighting one's own nation. If the good must be pursued, then caring for one's own must be extinguished, or it will make one unjust and impede the quest for the good. This undermines family and city; and they must at? tempt to prevent the distinction from even coming to light. Certainly, Polemarchus would regard the abandonment of his primary loyalties as the destruction of the purpose and dignity of his life. If, however, he is to be consistent with the argument, he must make this sacrifice. A man who wishes to be just must be cosmopolitan. Thus far, Socrates has led us to the observation that in order to do good to friends and harm to enemies one need only be a philosopher and give up one's attachments to th e whom most men cill_friends. Nowhe attacks the entire view implied by the definition. He asserts that no just man would harm anyone, thereby opposing his own un? derstanding of justice to that of the gentleman. His is an utterly un? political view, one that seems to deny the distinction between friend and enemy. It takes no account of the desire to avenge insults and ap? pears to be predicated on the notion that life is not essentially com? petitive. Socrates does not suggest that the just man would want to benefit all men, only that he would want to benefit his friends and re? main indifferent to the others. Polemarchus believes that it is impossible to benefit friends without harming enemies, for every city is in competi? tion with other cities for the possession of scarce things. There cannot be cities without enemies, and a man cannot be a good citizen without wishing ill to his city's enemies. One can be indifferent to ene? mies if one divorces oneself from the city's perspective and if the things one considers good are not threatened or scarce. Only the things of the mind are such as to belong to al1 men without nerssary exc1usion of some men and the war consequent on that exc1usio . Nobody need take a man's knowledge from him in order to enjoy it a one would have to do in order to make use of his money. Socrates' vi; is that of philoso? phy, in which knowledge is the highest good; Pole archus' view is that of the city, in which property is the highest, at lea the most needful, good. In the concluding portion of their discussion, Socrates and Polemarchus actually have entirely different understandings of what it means to harm someone. Socrates says that to harm is to make a person or thing worse, with respect to his or its specific virtue. Justice, he asserts without proof, is human virtue, so to harm someone would be to ï¿½ make him more unjust.
