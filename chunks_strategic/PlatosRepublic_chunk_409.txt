the sort who surround kings and tyrants. This meaning is not entirely alien to the Greek sense, but it is at a certain remove from the primary meaning. The sycophants were men who made accusations against Athenian citizens, acting, as it were, as public prosecutors. They were black? mailers; any charge they might make could cause difficulty and, at the ]east, would be expensive. They distorted the meaning of men's acts and statements, and Socrates, accused of making the worse argument appear the better, cou]d be compared to them. He was trying to cause trouble and make his in? terlocutors ]ook bad before the public. The sycophants were flatterers of the tyrant public opinion, since their charges usua]]y had to do with a]]eged crimes against civil society, and since the juries were chosen ï¿½by Jot from the citizen body at large. 16. This is another Jega] term in a scene that is a sort of mock accusation of Socrates. The word implies any crime of malicious damage or fraud. 17. The term used is poneros, one which has strong moral overtones, implying something worthless or vicious. The exact translation would be "villainous," and the word has precisely the same history as the English word villain-origina]]y it refers to someone who works. The use of the term in this context prepares for a technical or scientific treatment of virtue and vice. Just as the body's vice is corrected by the art of medicine, the soul's vice is cor? rected by the art of politics. The word was translated as "bad" in the discus? sion at 334c-e. 18. The Greek word is pleonexia, which means "greed," "grasping," or "overreaching," but is derived from the words meaning "to have more" or "to get more/' This sense is played upon in what fo]]ows, and it should be remem? bered that "to get the better" is an idiomatic English rendering, and that the Greek is "more" rather than "better" (cf. 349e). 19. "Kidnappers" here means those who capture men and sen them into slavery. "Housebreakers" are those who break through the mud or plaster walls of the Athenian homes in order to enter. 20. An attendant in the public bathhouses who brought water and soap and performed some of the offices of a barber. These were proverbially vulgar men and great talkers. 21. This expression refers to the way a nurse feeds a balky child by put? ting food into its mouth. Thrasymachus becomes the nurse Socrates needs (cf. 343a). 22. The Greek word is idion which in its simplest sense means "private" as opposed to public or common (cf. 333a, note 23). It can also mean the indi? vidual, as opposed to the general, or the peculiar character of a thing. The op? position between private and public is an important theme in the Republic and, in some respects, it is the core of the problem of justice. The private is usually of distinctly lower sta us than the public; but there are occasions
