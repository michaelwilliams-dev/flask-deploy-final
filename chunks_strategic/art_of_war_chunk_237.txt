can.� For military operations it is essential to strive to win the hearts of heroes, to make the rules of rewards and punishments strict, to include both cultural and martial arts, and to combine both hard and soft techniques. Enjoy social amenities and music; familiarize yourself with poetry and prose. Put humanity and justice before wit and bravery. In stillness be as quiet as a fish in the deep, in action be as swift as an otter. Dissolve enemies� collusion; break down their strengths. Dazzle people with your banners; alert people with cymbals and drums. Withdraw like a mountain in movement, advance like a rainstorm. Strike and crush with shattering force; go into battle like a tiger. Press enemies and contain them; lure and entice them. Confuse them and seize them; be humble to make them proud. Be familiar yet distant; weaken them by lending strength. Give security to those in danger; gladden those in fear. If people oppose you, take what they say to heart; if people have grudges, let them express themselves. Restrain the strong, sustain the weak. Get to know those with plans; cover up any slander. When there is booty, distribute it. Do not count on your strength and take an opponent lightly. Do not be conceited about your abilities and think little of subordinates. Do not let personal favor congeal into authority. Plan before acting. Fight only when you know you can win. Do not keep the spoils of war for your own possession and use. If generals can be like this, people will be willing to fight when they give the orders, and the enemy will be defeated before any blood is shed.

As an alien dynasty that had to depend on the native Chinese bureaucracy, the Yuan regime was wary of close bonding between local officials and the people at large. It had already been a long-standing policy of the Chinese government to appoint officials to posts outside of their own home areas, in order to prevent the growth of local factionalism. This in turn produced other problems, but in any event the whole syndrome of unease stemming from tension between central and regional interests naturally became aggravated under alien regimes like the Mongol Yuan. This tension is a pervasive thread of Chinese history, one that is clearly evident in the triumphs and trials of the great Liu Ji. In 1348 Liu was appointed by the Yuan government to direct a containment action against an insurrection, for Liu was not only a brilliant scholar but also a
