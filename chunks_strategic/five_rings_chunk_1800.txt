PRINCIPALITY Turningouscurriesmeanstofavortheandcasewithintolerablyoftheaprivatecitizensviolentcitizentowho eschews nefari- methods andinstead become Prince (here called aCivil Principality —achieved neither byvirtue norby fortune butrather bylucky astuteness), thiskind ofrulership is reached with thefavor ofboth thepeople andleading citizens. Every cityismade ofthese twoelements created bythefactthat thepeople donotwant tobecommanded oroppressed bythe prominent leaders, andtheprominent leaders wish tocommand andoppress thepeople. From these twoinstincts areborn three outcomes; either aPrincipality, orliberty, orunbridled license. APrincipality arises when either thepeople ortheprominent citizens seeanopportunity todominate: theprominent leaders, scared ofthepopulace, back thereputations ofoneoftheir own sothatthey canwork their purposes under hisshadow. Orthe populace, scared oftheprominent citizens, sees anopportunity to raise oneoftheir own who willdefend their interests. One who assumes leadership with thehelp oftheprominent citizens oroli- garchy hasmore trouble maintaining hisposition than oneraised bythepopulace. APrince raised byother prominent leaders finds himself constrained because theothers surrounding himarehis equals andwillnotbecommanded byhimoreasily managed. One who israised bythepopulace finds himself alone sur- rounded mostly bypeople ready toobey. Itishard, moreover, to please equals andother great citizens without hurting someone, buteasier tohelp thepopulace. Theinterest ofthepopulace is more honest than thatofprominent citizens who want tocom- mand andoppress, while thepopulace only wants tobefreeof oppression. Ontheother hand, anunfriendly populace ishard to 66— Niccolò Machiavelli manage because they aremany, while, since prominent citizens arefew, aPrince canmanage them. The worst aPrince canexpect from thepopulace istobe abandoned bythem. Butiftheprominent fewareagainst himnot only may they abandon himbutalso they may conspire against him. They seemore clearly andarethemselves more astute, are outtosave andadvance themselves, andsupport whomsoever canwin. APrince always hastolivewith thesame populace, but hecandowithout other leading citizens whom hecansuppress or favor every day, wrecking ormaking their reputations. Tobe clearer, astoimportant personages —thenoblemen —either theyhelp ingovernage bytheir ways tofavor thePrince's fortune, orthey don't. Those who help outandarenotrapacious need to behonored andloved; there aretwoways ofdealing with the others. Either they behave thisway because they arepusillani- mous andnaturally flawed —inwhich case thePrince needs to relyonthemost wise andexpert among hiscounselors, because intimes ofprosperity theywillhonor himwhile inadversity there isnothing tofearfrom them. Butwith those who behave thisway purposely andconsciously andformotives ofambition, itshows they think first ofthemselves rather than ofthePrince. Against these, thePrince needs tobeonguard. Heshould fearandtreat them asenemies. Intimes oftrouble, they will always help to ruinhim. One who becomes Prince through thefavor ofthepopulace needs tokeep itfriendly. This iseasy because allthepopulace wants istonotbeoppressed. Butonewho reaches power byfa- vorofgreat personages needs atallcosts tocurry thefavor ofthis populace —which iseasy ifheappeals foritsprotection. People, when they getsomething good where they expected something bad, admire their benefactor more, andthepopulace iseven more favorable ifthePrince canwinthisfavor inmany ways. Each Prince differs. There arenorules orcertainties. Sowewillskip this.Inconclusion: aPrince needs afriendly populace; otherwise, inadversity, there isnohope. Nabide (205 to192B.C.), Prince oftheSpartans, survived the THE PRINCE —67 blockade ofallGreece andavictorious Roman army, andde- fended hishomeland andstate; surviving theoriginal onslaught, heneeded only todefend himself against afewenemies. Ifhehad hadthepopulace against him, thiswould nothave sufficed. This istruedespite those who repeat thattrite proverb: "Who counts onthepopulace builds onmud." This may bethecase when a man ofthepeople counts onthem andpromises toliberate them from theoppression ofenemies andmagistrates. Such aperson may bedeceived, aswere theGracchi inRome (2nd century B.C.), andaswasGiorgio Scali inFlorence (d.1382). But, when aPrince who canruleasaman ofvalor, who
