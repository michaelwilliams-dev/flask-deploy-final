who nevertheless lost their empire and were assassinated by those who plotted against them. Since I want to answer these charges I will mention the qualities of cer. tain emperors , showing the reason for their to be in with fall line what I have said . This will put in perspective the conditions of those times . It is enough to cite all those Emperors who suc.ceeded to the rule of Marcus Aurelius the Philosopher ( 161-180 ) up to Massimino ( 235-238 ) � I mean Marcus , his son Commo.dius ( 180-192 ) , Pertinacius ( 193 ) , Julianus ( 193 ) , Septimus Severus ( 193-211 ) , Caracalla ( 211-217 ) , Macrinus (217-218 ) , Eleogaballus (218-222) , Alexander Severius (222-235 ) and Mas.siminus (235-238 ) . 102 -Niccol� Machiavelli The first thing to notice is that while other Princes have only to contend with the ambitions of the nobles and the insolence of the populace , the Roman emperors had a third difficulty: the cru.elty and avariciousness of the military. This was foremost in the ruin of Princes . The soldiers love the warlike Prince , one who was insolent, cruel , and rapacious . This often made the Prince turn against the populace to pay and satisfy the avarice and cru. elty of the military. As a result, those Emperors who had , by nature or design, no great reputation could not keep one or the other element in line . They always got ruined . Most of them , especially those who rose newly to ruler, seeing this conflict, mostly favored the soldiers , under-estimating the harm done to the people. This was neces. sary. A Prince will always be hated by some one . He can try first to win general popularity, but, if he has to choose , he cannot af. ford to be unpopular with the most powerful faction which is the army. Those new Princes who need to curry special favor turn sooner to the army than to the people . This in turn stands useful to the Prince according to how he stands with the populace . For these reasons , it turns out that Marcus , Pertinacius , and Alexander, all living modest lives , loving justice , enemies of cru. elty, human and benign, all except Marcus -had bad ends . Only Marcus lived and died in honor . This was because he inher.ited the empire legally. He did not owe it to either the soldiers or the populace . As a man of virtue for which he was venerated , he kept a balance between the two orders on his own terms , avoiding both hatred and scorn . But Pertinacius was raised to Emperor against the will of the soldiers who , accustomed to a licentious life under Commodus , could not tolerate the honest life that Per. tinacius demanded . Arousing their hatred , and , besides , being old
