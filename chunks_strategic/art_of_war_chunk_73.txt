said: We may distinguish six kinds of terrain, to wit: (1) Accessible ground; [Mei Yao-ch�en says: "plentifully provided with roads and means of com- munications."] (2) entangling ground; [The same commentator says: "Net-like country, venturing into which you become entangled."] (3) temporizing ground; [Ground which allows you to "stave off" or "delay."] (4) narrow passes; (5) precipitous heights; (6) positions at a great distance from the enemy. [It is hardly necessary to point out the faultiness of this classification. A strange lack of logical perception is shown in the Chinaman�s unquestion- ing acceptance of glaring cross- divisions such as the above.] 2. Ground which can be freely traversed by both sides is called ACCESS- IBLE. 3. With regard to ground of this nature, be before the enemy in occupying the raised and sunny spots, and carefully guard your line of supplies. 86 CHAPTER 11. TERRAIN 87 [The general meaning of the last phrase is doubtlessly, as Tu Yu says, "not to allow the enemy to cut your communications." In view of Napoleon�s dictum, "the secret of war lies in the communications," 1 we could wish that Sun Tzu had done more than skirt the edge of this important subject here and in I. ss. 10, VII. ss. 11. Col. Henderson says: "The line of supply may be said to be as vital to the existence of an army as the heart to the life of a human being. Just as the duelist who finds his adversary�s point menacing him with certain death, and his own guard astray, is com- pelled to conform to his adversary�s movements, and to content himself with warding off his thrusts, so the commander whose communications are suddenly threatened finds himself in a false position, and he will be fortunate if he has not to change all his plans, to split up his force into more or less isolated detachments, and to fight with inferior numbers on ground which he has not had time to prepare, and where defeat will not be an ordinary failure, but will entail the ruin or surrender of his whole army." 2 Then you will be able to fight with advantage. 4. Ground which can be abandoned but is hard to re-occupy is called EN- TANGLING. 5. From a position of this sort, if the enemy is unprepared, you may sally forth and defeat him. But if the enemy is prepared for your coming, and you fail to defeat him, then, return being impossible, disaster will ensue. 6. When the position is such that neither side will gain by making the first move, it is called TEMPORIZING ground. [Tu Mu says: "Each side finds it inconvenient to move, and the situation remains at a deadlock."] 7. In a position of this sort, even though the enemy should offer us an attract- ive bait, [Tu Yu says, "turning their backs on us and pretending to flee." But this is only one of the lures which might induce us to quit our position.]
