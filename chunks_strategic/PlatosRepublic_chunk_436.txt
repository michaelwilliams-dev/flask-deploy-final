It is in this way that Aristotle speaks of "saving the phe? nomena" (cf. Laws, 645b; and Philebus, 14a). 11. This means both "to have success in action" and "to do what is good." It is Plato's favored salutation. (Cf. Letters, III, 315a-b.) ï¿½ INDEX IN DEX This index has been constructed in accordance with the purposes of the translation. No modern categories alien to Plato's thought have been introduced, and wherever possible categories have been keyed to specific Greek words. Only the text of the Republic has been indexed. The references are to the stand? ard Platonic pagination-that of the first printed edition of Plato's works published by Stephanus in the sixteenth century-which appears at the side of the printed text. This enables the reader to find passages cited in secondary works with ease. The index is divided into four parts: (1) an index of names, (2) an index of subjects, (3) an index cataloguing the appearances of all the personages in the dialogue, except for Socrates who is ubiquitous, and (4) an index cataloguing the formulae of familiar address, for those who are interested in following their usage. The index of names and the catalogues of the dramatis personae and formulae of familiar address at? tempt to be complete, as do all those entries in the subject index marked withasterisks. A dash between two page citations (for example, 33la-333d) indicates either a high frequency in the occurence of a term or a thematic treatment of a given topic in that passage. It should be noted that it is impossible to make the lines of this translation ac? cord perfectly with those of the Stephanus edition. Therefore, occasionally there may be a slight imprecision in the index's references to the translation. In such a case, the reader may find, for example, that the word the index tells him is at--439d is actually in the last line of 439c. No attempt has been made to index the terms having to do with "being," re? lated to the word einai,"to be," for they occur too frequently. The thematic discussions of being occur at 475d-479d and 506d-518d. The terms which occur most frequently and their usual translations are: to on, "that which is"; ta onta, "the things which are"; to einai, "being"; ousiu, "substance" or "being."
