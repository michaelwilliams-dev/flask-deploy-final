also disrupts the body's harmony, and the men thus diseased must submit themselves to a doctor. Immoderation is the cause of all ills of body and city. Both judges and doctors should be kept out of the city as much as possible. The particular object of Socrates� apparent scorn is Herodicus, the founder of advanced and complex medicine, who was a sickly man and invented an art which kept his ruined body alive. The valetudinarian is ridiculous and dangerous because he subordinates everything to keeping himself alive and has nothing to live for but that life; if his kind of caring for life were to become general in a city, the city's virtue would be undermined, everything in it would be harnessed to that purpose-the soul would exist for the body rather than the body for the soul. Socrates opposes complex medicine with a simple, good medicine which was founded by the divine Asclepius and is described by Homer. Asclepius used ready methods which did not require the quest for rare medicines or any change in the patient's way of life. If these methods did not suffice, the patient was allowed to die. This may seem like a crude art of medicine, but Asclepius did not adopt it out of ignorance � but because he was political or statesmanlike, meaning he adapted the art of medicine to the common good. This kind of medicine does not threaten the practice of the virtues and the simple devotion to them; it does not emancipate the body and permit it to have a life of its own. Thus Socrates finds in Homer a twin to the simple poetry he has just elaborated in opposition to Homer. Complex poetry causes men to at? tach too much significance to what is perishable, to what is their own; complex medicine causes men to attach too much significance to their bodies. Perhaps the two errors are really the same. As the new poetry is intended to make men strong in the loss of their lives, their properties, and their loved ones, the old medicine was intended to make them strong in the disease of their bodies. Although Socrates' concern with the citizens' performing their du? ties makes his banishment of Herodicus' medicine comprehensible and even justifiable, it does not do away with the fact that Herodicus knew much more about the body than did Asclepius; nor does it do away with the fact that his art reveals the untruth of the myth concerning the simplicity or unity of man. To understand man one must understand his complexity, and to do that one must study his illness as well as his health, his vices as well as his virtues. Such a study is impossible in this city because it is too simple. Glaucon recognizes this when he warns Socrates that it will be difficult to have good judges in their city because the men in it will not have sufficient experience with the diversity of souls to be
