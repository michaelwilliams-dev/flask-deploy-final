youth, and it was not necessary to include it in his official name. Genshin is the Buddhist name that he chose as a participant in that spiritual path. The ideograms composing it can also be pronounced Masanobu. Masana would have been a childhood name. For a bushi, genealogy was of major importance. A sense of honor was always attached to the family name. Although the choice of name was sometimes a matter of circumstance and was flexible, once it was determined, a bushi lived and died by his name. 24. �School,� ryu: �Style,� fu, can also be read kaze, �wind.� �House� is ie. 1. 25. �In this way the chief carpenter�: In Japanese, there are two different ideograms that are pronounced toryo. Toryo: (1) post, beam; (2) he who is in charge of a country; (3) chief; (4) master carpenter. Toryo: (1) ruling all things; (2) he who rules and directs, presides. (100) Musashi uses the second ideogram to refer to the chief carpenter as well as the chief warrior, thus stressing the comparison. That is why, in this passage, I translated as �chief carpenter� and not �master carpenter,� as in the rest of the text. I translated as �resemble each other� the expression onaji, which literally means �the same, identical.� 26. Shoji: sliding screens made of stretched, translucent paper. 27. Tokonoma, toku mawari: architectural feature at the rear of the main room. 28. �Being vigilant with regard to the surroundings,� monogoto o yurusazaru kato: yurusazaru is used in the sense of ki o yurusanai, �not relaxing one�s attention and going into detail.� 29. �Knowing substance and its function�: taiyu o shiru. Musashi writes it tai yu, in hiragana. Authors offering commentaries on the Gorin no sho are of different opinions on the interpretation of this term, for which four transcriptions into ideograms are possible with the following meanings: 1. �Great courage� or �courage manifested in the accomplishment of an important thing.� (10) 2. �Function, effect, use.� (13) 3. �Essential point� (11); Kamata (4) retains the hiragana and gives an interpretation in his commentary that fits with that. 4. �Substance and its application� (Buddhist term). Musashi�s contemporary, Yagyu Munenori, writes: �Tai yu exists in each thing; when there is tai, there is yu. For example, the bow is tai and the act of aiming, drawing, and hitting the target is the yu of the bow. The lamp is tai and the light is yu The sword is tai; slashing and stabbing is yu. Thus the essence derives from tai, and that which arises from the essence and moves toward the outside in order to accomplish different functions is yu.� (56, p. 102) Yagyu Munenori developed a theory of the art of the sword based on the practice of Zen. Musashi also practiced Zen; that is why, in view of Yagyu Munenori�s interpretation, I based my translation on the fourth sense of the term. 30. �Ambient energy�: I translated the term ki, which means �air,� �ambience,� �vital energy,� this way in
