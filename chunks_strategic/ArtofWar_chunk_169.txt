opponent�s fate. DU MU The subtle is stillness, the mysterious is movement. Stillness is defense, movement is attack. Whether opponents live or die depends on you, so you are as though director of their fate. DU YOU This means being so subtle as to be imperceptible, and to be able to change suddenly like a mysterious spirit. MEI YAOCHEN Formlessness means being so subtle and secret that no one can spy on you. Soundlessness means being so mysteriously swift that no one notices you. Master Sun To advance irresistibly, push through their gaps. To retreat elusively, outspeed them. HO YANXI If your forces push through the opponent�s gaps as they move forward and take advantage of speed when they retreat, then you can overcome the opponent while the opponent cannot overcome you. ZHANG YU At a standoff, if you rush in and strike when you see a gap, how can the enemy fend you off?

DU MU This means that when opponents come to attack you, you do not fight with them but rather set up a strategic change to confuse them and make them uncertain, deflecting them from their original intention to attack, making them reluctant to fight with you. ZHANG YU When you are on your home ground and are well supplied compared to the number of soldiers you have, while opponents are on alien territory and have little food compared to their number, then it is to your advantage not to fight. If you want to be sure opponents will not dare come to do battle with you even though you are not heavily fortified, let them see a setup that confuses them and deflects their course. For example, when Sima Yi was going to attack Zhuge Liang, Zhuge took down his flags and put away his battle drums, opened the gates and swept the road. Yi suspected an
