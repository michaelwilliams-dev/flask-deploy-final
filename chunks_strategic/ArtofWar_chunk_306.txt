of secret agents is for the purpose of collecting vital information and the purpose of disseminating crucial misinformation. Secrecy is involved in gathering information because knowledge is power and therefore guarded; secrecy is involved in spreading misinformation to maintain the effect of illusion. Master Sun said, �Victory lies in consummation of . . . , a clear system of rewards, selecting elite troops, and taking advantage of enemies. . . . This is called the security of a great military.� A clear and reliable system of rewards is established to create a unified motivational structure capable of effectively directing the attention and effort of personnel. Elite troops, whose function and importance as vanguard forces were defined earlier, need to be chosen expertly, based on actual capacity, training, and accomplishment. The real point of taking advantage of enemies is to win by superior tactical skill rather than by overwhelming violence or force. It is based in the first place, of course, on the premise that the situation has already reached the point where enmity exists and conflict can no longer be avoided by any means. Master Sun said, �There is no command without leadership. �[There are three elements of] order: First is trust, second is loyalty, third is willingness. Wherein is loyalty? Loyalty to the government. Wherein is trust? In reliable rewards. Wherein is willingness? Willingness to get rid of the bad. �Without loyalty to the government, one may not presume to employ its military. But for reliability in rewards, the peasants will not be virtuous. But for the willingness to get rid of the bad, the peasants will not be respectful.� A militia, or a special task force of any kind, may accomplish something with its resources and skills, but if the effect is not in harmony with the legitimate underlying aims of the nation or the organization�which include the policies of the rulership or directorate as well as the aspirations of the citizens or the workers�it will be impossible to maintain lasting success and build upon successive achievements. [ 6 ] Timing Combat Master Sun said, �Between sky and earth, nothing is as noble as humanity. . . . The right seasonal timing, the advantages of the terrain, harmony among personnel�if these three things are not gained, there is calamity even in victory. Therefore it is better to give before fighting, only doing battle when there is no choice.� Even victory is calamitous without the right seasonal timing, the advantages of the terrain, and harmony among personnel, because under these conditions victory will have been won at the cost of loss of productive labor, environmental destruction, and excessively high casualty rates. The Taoist classic Tao Te Ching says, �If one were bold but had no mercy, if one were far-ranging but not frugal, if one went ahead without deference, one would die.� The conclusion that it is �better to give before fighting, only doing battle when there is no choice� is also reflected in the Tao Te Ching, which
