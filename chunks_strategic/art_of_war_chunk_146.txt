apply them. You cannot say what you will do before the event. MEI YAOCHEN Since you adapt and adjust appropriately in face of the enemy, how could you say what you are going to do beforehand? Master Sun The one who figures on victory at headquarters before even doing battle is the one who has the most strategic factors on his side. The one who figures on inability to prevail at headquarters before doing battle is the one who has the least strategic factors on his side. The one with many strategic factors in his favor wins, the one with few strategic factors in his favor loses�how much the more so for one with no strategic factors in his favor. Observing the matter in this way, I can see who will win and who will lose. ZHANG YU When your strategy is deep and far-reaching, then what you gain by your calculations is much, so you can win before you even fight.

LI QUAN As the classic Spring and Autumn Annals says, �War is like a fire�if you do not put it out, it will burn itself out.� JIA LIN If a military operation goes on for a long time without accomplishing anything, your rivals will begin to get ideas. DU YOU Arms are tools of ill omen�to employ them for an extended period of time will bring about calamity. As it is said, �Those who like to fight and so exhaust their military inevitably perish.� Master Sun When your forces are dulled, your edge is blunted, your strength is exhausted, and your supplies are gone, then others will take
