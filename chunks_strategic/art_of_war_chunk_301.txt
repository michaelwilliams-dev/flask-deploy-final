effective offense to put an end to the conflict. All of these things may have their place in tactical action, in short, but no one of them is sufficient to be in itself quintessential to victory. Flushed with anger, Tian Ji retorted, �These six things are employed by all experts, and yet you, Maestro, say they are not crucial. If so, then what is crucial?� Master Sun replied, �Sizing up the opposition, figuring out the danger zones, making sure to survey the terrain, . . . are guiding principles for commanders. To make sure you attack where there is no defense is what is crucial to warriorship. . . .� Part of Sun Bin�s reply is also missing here, but the overall sense of the passage emphasizes preparedness and surprise. Both of these factors are stressed throughout classical strategic literature. Tian Ji asked, �Is there a principle according to which a deployed army should not engage in combat?� Master Sun answered, �Yes. When you occupy a narrow strait and have further increased defensive fortification of this fastness, be quiet, be on the alert, and do not move. Let nothing seduce you, let nothing anger you.� When you are in a secure position, if you rise to an enemy�s bait and let yourself be drawn out through greed or rage, then you give up your security to expose yourself to indefinite risks. Tian Ji asked Master Sun, �Is there a principle according to which one should not fail to engage in combat even if the opposition is numerous and powerful?� Master Sun said, �Yes.

Evade them to make them haughty, lure them to tire them, attack where they are unprepared, act when they least expect it, and make sure you can keep this up.� Evading a powerful enemy to give the impression of weakness or lack of confidence is a tactic to induce arrogance, complacency, and over-confidence in order to weaken the enemy�s tension and attention. Luring the enemy on fruitless chases is a tactic to wear down the enemy�s stamina and patience. Acting outside of expectation and striking where there is no defense are general principles of strategy, but they are particularly recommended in cases where there is so much difference in relative strength that direct confrontation is unfeasible. Tian Ji asked Master Sun, �What is the Awl Formation for? What is the Goose Formation for? What are elite troops for? What is rapid-fire shooting with powerful bows for? What is a whirlwind battle line for? What are common soldiers for?� Master Sun replied, �The Awl Foundation is for piercing tight defenses and breaking edges. The Goose Formation is for sniping on flanks and responding to changes. . . . Elite troops are for crashing through battle lines to capture commanders. Rapid-fire shooting with strong bows is for ease of battle and the ability to hold out for a long time. A whirlwind battle line is for .
