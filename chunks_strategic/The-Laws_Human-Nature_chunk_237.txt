to the public�this was the slight, very gentle woman who had written such a powerful horror story? When Lord Byron died in Greece shortly after Mary�s return to London, Mary became even more famous, for she had been one of Byron�s closest friends. All of the principal English intellectuals wanted to meet her, to find out more about her, Lord Byron, and her husband. Even Jane was now back to her friendly self, although at times she seemed to withdraw from Mary. Despite her fame, Mary was unhappy. She did not want the attention, because it came with endless gossip about her past and insinuations about her morality. She was tired of being looked at and judged. She wanted to hide herself and raise her son. She decided she would move close to where Jane was living, in a more remote part of London. There Percy would be reunited with Jane�s children. They could live for each other and share their memories, recapture the past. Jane was so cheerful, and Mary needed cheering up. In return, she would do whatever it took to take care of Jane.

Mary empathized with her plight as a lonely widow, her need for a husband. Jane was now pregnant with Hogg�s child. Mary struggled to get over her resentment and to help Jane as best she could. They saw less and less of each other. To distract her from her loneliness, Mary befriended a beautiful young woman named Isabel Robinson who needed help�she had given birth to an illegitimate child and her father would certainly disown her if he discovered the truth. For weeks Mary conspired to help her, planning to send Isabel to Paris to live with a �man� who would act as the father�the man in this case being a woman known as Miss Dods, a notorious lesbian who loved to dress as a man and could easily pass for one.
