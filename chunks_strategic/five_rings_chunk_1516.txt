The great charlatan mountebanks ofseventeenth- andeighteenth-century Europeused humor and entertainment todeceive their audiences. Dazzled byagreat show, the public would notnotice thecharlatans’ real intentions. Thus the star charla- tanhimself wouldappearintown inanight-blackcoach drawn byblack horses. Clowns, tightrope walkers, and star entertainers wouldaccompany him, pulling peopleintohisdemonstrations ofelixirs andquack potions. The charlatan made entertainment seem like thebusiness oftheday;the business ofthedaywasactuallythesale oftheelixirs andquack potions. Spectacleand entertainment, clearly,areexcellent devices toconceal your intentions, buttheycannot beused indefinitely. The public grows tired andsuspicious, andeventuallycatches ontothetrick. And indeed the charlatans had tomove quicklyfrom town totown, before wordspread that thepotionswere useless and theentertainment atrick. Powerfulpeo- plewith bland exteriors, ontheother hand—the Talleyrands,theRoth- schilds, the Selassies—can practice their deceptionsinthe same place throughout their lifetimes. Their act never wears thin, andrarelycauses suspicion.The colorful smoke screen should beused cautiously, then, and onlywhen theoccasion isright.
