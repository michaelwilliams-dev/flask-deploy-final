the rebellious part is to rule in the soul although this is not proper, since by nature it is fit to be a slave to that which belongs to the ruling class.35 Something of this sort I suppose we'll say, and that the confusion and wandering of these parts are injustice licentiousness, cowardice, lack of learning, and, in sum, vice entire."' "Certainly," he said, "that is what they are." "Then," I said, "as for performing unjust actions and being unjust and, again, doing just things, isn't what all of them are by now clearly manifest, if injustice and justice are also manifest?" "How so?" "Because," I� said, "they don't differ from the healthy and the sick; what these are in a body, they are in a soul." "In what way?" he said. "Surely healthy things produce health and sick ones sickness." "Yes.� "Doesn't doing just things also produce justice and unjust ones in- d. justice?" "Necessarily." "To produce health is to establish the parts of the body in a rela? tion of mastering, and being mastered by, one another that is according to nature, while to produce sickness is to establish a relation of ruling, and being ruled by, one another that is contrary to nature." "It is." "Then, in its turn," I said, "isn't to produce justice to establish the parts of the soul in a relation of mastering, and being mastered by, one another that is according to nature, while to produce injustice is to establish a relation of ruJing, and being ruled by, one another that is contrary to nature?" "Entirely so," he said. "Virtue, then, as it seems, would be a certain health, beauty and d. good condition of a soul, and vice a sickness, ugliness and weakness." "So it is." "Don't fine practices also conduce to the acquisition of virtue and base ones to vice?" "Necessarily." "So, as it seems, it now remains for us to consider whether it is profitable to do just things, practice fine ones, and be just-whether or not one's being such remains unnoticed; or whether it is profitable to do injustice and be unjust-provided one doesn't pay the penalty and be? come better as a result of punishment." "But Socrates," he said, "that inquiry looks to me as though it has become ridiculous by now. If life doesn't seem livable with the body's nature corrupted, not even with every sort of food and drink and every sort of wealth and every sort of rule, will it then be livable when the nature of that very thing by which we live is confused and corrupted, even if a man does whatever else he might want except that which will rid him of vice and injustice and will enable him to acquire justice and virtue? Isn't this clear now that all of these qualities have manifested their characters in our description?" "Yes, it is ridiculous," I said. "But all the same, since we've come to the place from which we are able
