speed; gather them into a squad and call them �the warriors who crash the battle lines.� There are those who are light of foot, good walkers and runners; gather them into a squad called �the warriors who capture the flag.� There are those who can shoot on horseback, swift as flight, hitting the mark every time; gather them into one squad and call them �the galloping warriors.� There are archers whose aim is accurate and deadly; gather them into one squad and call them �the warriors of the fighting edge.� There are those who can shoot heavy crossbows and catapults accurately at great distances; gather them into one squad and call them �the warriors who crush the enemy�s edge.� These six kinds of skilled warriors should be employed according to their particular skills. The Use of Knowledge Generalship requires one to follow nature, depend on timing, and rely on people in order to achieve victory. Therefore, if nature works but the timing doesn�t work, and yet people act, this is called opposing the time. If the timing works but nature isn�t cooperating, and still people act, this is called opposing nature. If timing and nature both work, but people do not act, this is called opposing people. Those who know do not oppose nature, do not oppose the time, and do not oppose people.
