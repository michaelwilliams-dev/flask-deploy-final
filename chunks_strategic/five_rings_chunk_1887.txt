"Itoohaveheard it,"hesaid. "This speech," Isaid, "certainly indicates thatanger sometimes makes waragainst thedesires asonething against something else.' "Yes," hesaid, "itdoes indicate that." "And inmany other places, don't we," Isaid, "notice that,when desires force someone contrary tocalculation, hereproaches him- b selfand hisspirit isroused against that inhimwhich isdoing theforc- ing;and, just asthough therewere twoparties atfaction, such aman's spiritbecomes theallyofspeech?
