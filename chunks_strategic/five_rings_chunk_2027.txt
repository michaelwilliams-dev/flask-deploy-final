perfectly manifest thatthe lifeof reason, contrary tothepolitical view stated inBook IV,hasacharacter ofitsown fardifferent from thecalculation ofthepractical man.The activity ofaking isnotthesame asthatofaphilosopher. Itisatthis point intheelaboration ofthegood citythatweseethat itcannot fulfill itsintention and ishence afailure. Theattempt was tofound acityin which every member's dutywasidentical tohisself-interest, inwhich totaldedication waspossible, inwhich theuniversal demands ofjustice [407 ] THEREPUBLIC didnotundermine thelawsofthecity,andinwhich therewasnoclaim thatwentbeyond thecity limits. Thiswastobeacitywithout limits. Butnow itisevident thatinthedecisive respect thecity isnotnatural: itcannot comprehend thehighest activity ofman.Wemodem men are accustomed toinsist thatalmost every claim against civil society is valid, butSocrates denies this.There isonlyoneclaim thedignity of which isgreater than thatofthecity;only atthispointdothelimits of thecitybecome clear. Inthelight ofthesplendor ofthesoul's yearning after thewhole, thecitylooks very ugly. This isthetruecomedyâ€” taking thecitywith infinite seriousness, beautifying itwith every artifice, making ita veritable Callipolis, andthen finding thatcompared tothesoulwhich wassupposed tobelike it,itisathing tobedespised. This faircity,the goal ofsomany aspirations, now looks like acave, and itshappy citizens likeprisoners; itiscomparable totheHades ofwhich Achilles complained, andtheattachment toitisaspecies offolly.From the point ofview ofthecity,thephilosopher looks ridiculous; butfrom the point ofview ofthewhole, thecitizen looks ridiculous. Socrates asks which ofthetwocpntexts isthemore authoritative. Aristophanes' com- edy isthehuman comedy, Socrates' thedivine. Only thephilosophers canprovide thecitywithanendthatcan direct itsactions. Theordinary statesmen serve thecityandseek to provide foritspreservation, which isonly acondition ofaction, notan end.Onlyknowledge seems tohave thecharacter ofanend initself. Butthephilosopher hasnothing todowith thecity.Thepractical vir- tuescanonlybejustified ifthey areunderstood tobethemeans tothe theoretical virtues. Butthe citycannot consider itself ameans to philosophy. Thisunion ofphilosophy andthecity isashotgun wed- ding.The citizens would notbeslaves tothephilosophers' well-being, considering themselves means toanendinwhich theydonotpartake; andthephilosopher, although hetooneeds preservation, canarrange that inlessburdensome fashion than ruling. This disproportion between cityandphilosophy becomes ever more evident during thepresentation ofthephilosophic education. Glaucon andSocrates agree thatthestudies must servewarandthought because these aretwoessential activities ofkingswhoarephilosophers. Butinthecourse ofthediscussion thepolitically relevant content of thestudies progressively decreases, andfinally they areforced toaban- donthenotion thatphilosophic studies haveanything todowith action inthe city. Socrates even reproaches Glaucon with hindering and distorting thephilosophic education byhispractical concern, onwhich hehimself hadpreviously insisted. Now theonly justification ofthe higher learning isphilosophy. [408 ] Interpretive Essay Socrates hasproved inthecourse ofthedialogue that allcities need theruleofwisdom andthatwisdom means knowledge ofthetrue whole orthe firstcauses. Hehasshown thatonly thephilosopher is concerned withsuchknowledge andhence ispotentially theonly true ruler. Buthehasnotshown thatsuchknowledge ispossible, thatany mancanactually convert himself from alover ofwisdom intoawise manbyknowing everything there istoknow. This isalsoacondition of the city's possibility. Just asSocrates hasoverstated thecase forthe possibility ofthecity's accepting wisdom, heoverstates thecaseforthe possibility ofaman's becoming wise.Heseems tosaythat the philosophers willcomplete their labors andcome toknow theideaof thegood. But itisdoubtful whether themind's eyecanlook directly at thegoodwithout being dazzled anymore thanthebody's eyecanlook directly atthesunwithout being dazzled. Philosophy, asSocrates usually teaches, hasthecharacter ofanunfinished andunfinishable quest. Ifthis istrue, itmeans thatthephilosopher cannot rulebecause hedoesnotknow whathewould need toknow inorder torule.He is thegood citizen because heisseeking toacquire what thecitymost needs, buthehasnotyetsucceeded inacquiring it,sothatbothheand thecityareincomplete. Further, thephilosopher haslesstime torule thanwould awiseman,because hisurgent business isunfinished. Both thephilosopher's ignorance andhislackofavailable freetimecaused bythatignorance militate against hisbeing able torule. The finalcondition fortheactualization ofthebestregime isthat thosewhohave compelled thephilosophers tobecome kings must abandon their city, lands, andchildren, leaving nooneovertenyears of ageinthecity,sothatanentirely newformation ofthesoulcanbegiv- entothechildren. Socrates blandly announces thiscondition as though therenunciation ofallthey liveforbythewhole citizen body were easy toaccomplish. And itwould have tobeavoluntary renun- ciation
