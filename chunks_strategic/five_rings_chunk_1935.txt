aspects bepeculiar tothisregime?" "Yes." "And suchmen," Isaid, "will desire money just asthose inoligar- chies do,andunder cover ofdarkness payfierce honor togoldand sil- ver,because they possess storehouses anddomestic treasuries where theycandeposit andhidethem; andthey willhave walls around their houses, exactly likeprivate nests, where they canmake lavish expen- ditures onwomen andwhomever elsetheymight wish." b "Very true," hesaid. "Then they will alsobestingy withmoney because theyhonor it anddon't acquire itopenly; but,pushed onbydesire, they willlove to spend other people's money; andthey willharvest pleasures stealthily, running awayfrom thela^likeboysfrom afather. This isbecause they weren't educated bypersuasion butbyforce—theresult ofneglect of thetrueMuse accompanied byarguments andphilosphy while giving more distinguished honor togymnastic thanmusic." c "You certainly speak ofareigme," hesaid,"which isamixture of badandgood." "Yes, itismixed," Isaid, "but due tothedominance of [225 ] socrates/glaucon/adeimantus therepublic 548c spiritedness onething alone ismost distinctive init:loveofvictories andofhonors." "Verymuch so,"hesaid. "Then"Isaid, "this istheway thisregime would come intobeing andwhat itwould belike— given thefactthatweareonly outlininga d regime's figure inspeech andnotworking out itsdetails precisely, since even theoutline issufficient forseeing thejustestmanandtheunjustest one,and itisanimpractically longjobtogothrough allregimes and all dispositions andleave nothing out." "Right," hesaid. "Who, then, isthemancorresponding tothisregime? How didhe come intobeing andwhat sortofman ishe?" "Isuppose," saidAdeimantus, "that asfarasloveofvictory goes, he'dbesomewhere near toGlaucon here." e "Perhaps inthat," Isaid, "but inthese other respects hisnature does not, inmyopinion, correspond toGlaucon's." "Which respects?" "Hemustbemore stubborn," 1said,"andsomewhat lessapt at music although heloves it,andmustbealover ofhearing although he's 549a bynomeans skilled inrhetoric. With slaves such amanwould be brutal, notmerely despising slaves astheadequately educated man does.Butwithfreemen hewould betameandtorulers most obedient. He isalover ofruling andofhonor, notbasing hisclaim toruleon speaking oranything ofthesort,butonwarlike deeds andeverything connected with war;heisalover ofgymnastic andthehunt." "Yes," hesaid, "that isthedisposition belonging tothisregime." "Wouldn't such aman," Isaid,"when heisyoung alsodespise b money, butashegrows older takeevermore delight inparticipating in themoney-lover's nature andnotbepure inhisattachment tovirtue, having beenabandoned bythebestguardian?" "What's that?" Adeimantus said. "Argument mixed with music," Isaid. "Italone, when itis present, dwells within theonepossessing itasasavior ofvirtue throughout life." "What yousay isfine," hesaid. "Such, then," Isaid, "isthetimocratic youth, likethetimocratic city." i c "Most certainly." "And this ishowhecomes intobeing," Isaid."Sometimes heis theyoung sonofagood fatherwho lives inacitythat isnotunder a good regime, afatherwho flees thehonors, theruling offices, thelaw- [226 ] iBook VIII /548c-550c sochates/adeimantus suits,andeverything ofthesort that's tothebusybody's taste,andwho 549c iswilhng tobegotten thebetter ofsoasnottobebothered." "Inwhatway, then, doeshecome intobeing?" hesaid. "When," Isaid, "inthe firstplace, helistens tohismother com- plaining. Herhusband isnotoneoftherulers andasaresult she isata disadvantage among theotherwomen. Moreover, sheseesthatheisn't d very serious aboutmoney anddoesn't fightand insult people forits sake inprivate actions incourts and inpublic buttakes everything of thesort inaneasygoing way;andshebecomes aware thathealways turns hismind tohimself andneither honors nordishonors hervery much. Shecomplains about allthisandsaysthat hisfather islacking in courage andtooslack, and,ofcourse, chants alltheother refrains such aswomen arelikely todoincases ofthis sort." e "Yes, indeed," saidAdeimantus, "it'sjust likethem tohavemany complaints." "And youknow," Isaid, "that thedomestics ofsuchmen—those domestics who seem well-disposed —^sometimes also secretly say similar things tothesons,and ifthey seesomeone whooweshim money ordoessome other injustice andwhom thefather doesn't prosecute, theyurge thesontopunish allsuchmenwhen hebecomes a man,andthus tobemore ofamanthan hisfather.
