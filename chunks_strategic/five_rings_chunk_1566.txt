ofabsence andpresence.Atthe start ofanaffair, youneed toheighten your presence intheeyes ofthe other. Ifyou absent yourselftooearly, you maybeforgotten. But once yourlover‘s emotions areengaged,and thefeeling oflove hascrystallized, absence inflames and excites. Givingno reason foryour absence excites even more: The otherpersonassumes heorshe isatfault. Whileyouare away,thelover’simaginationtakes flight,and astimulated imagination cannot helpbutmake love grow stronger. Conversely,the more Guillelma pursued Guillaume, theless heloved her—she had become toopresent, tooaccessible, leavingnoroom forhisimaginationandfancy,sothat his feelingswere suffocating. When shefinally stopped sending messengers, hewas able tobreathe again,and toreturn tohisplan. What withdraws, what becomes scarce, suddenlyseems todeserve our respectand honor. Whatstaystoolong, inundatinguswith itspresence, makes usdisdain it.IntheMiddle Ages,ladies were constantly putting their knights through trials oflove, sending them onsome longand ardu- ousquest—-alltocreate apattern ofabsence andpresence. Indeed, had Guillaume notlefthisladyinthefirstplace,shemight have been forced to send himaway, creatinganabsence ofher own.

Now theMedes had to establish anewgovernment.Determined toavoidany form ofdespotism, theyrefused togive ultimate powertoanyone man, ortoestablish a monarchy. Without aleader, however, thecountrysoon fellinto chaos, and fractured into small kingdoms, with village fighting against village. Inone such village lived aman named Deioces, who began tomake a name forhimself forfairdealingand theabilitytosettle disputes.

When news spread ofDeioces’ wisdom, incormptibility,and unshakable impartiality, Medean villagesfarand wide turned tohim tosettle allman- nerofcases. Soon hebecame thesole arbiter ofjusticeintheland.
