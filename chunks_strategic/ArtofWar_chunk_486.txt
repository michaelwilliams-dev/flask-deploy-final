For it is the soldier�s disposition to offer an obstinate resistance when sur- rounded, to fight hard when he cannot help himself, and to obey promptly when he has fallen into danger. [Chang Yu alludes to the conduct of Pan Ch�ao�s devoted followers in 73 A.D. The story runs thus in the HOU HAN SHU, ch. 47: "When Pan Ch�ao arrived at Shan-shan, Kuang, the King of the country, received him at first with great politeness and respect; but shortly afterwards his be- havior underwent a sudden change, and he became remiss and negligent. Pan Ch�ao spoke about this to the officers of his suite: �Have you no- ticed,� he said, �that Kuang�s polite intentions are on the wane? This must signify that envoys have come from the Northern barbarians, and that con- sequently he is in a state of indecision, not knowing with which side to throw in his lot. That surely is the reason. The truly wise man, we are told, can perceive things before they have come to pass; how much more, then, those that are already manifest!� Thereupon he called one of the nat- ives who had been assigned to his service, and set a trap for him, saying: �Where are those envoys from the Hsiung-nu who arrived some day ago?� The man was so taken aback that between surprise and fear he presently blurted out the whole truth. Pan Ch�ao, keeping his informant carefully under lock and key, then summoned a general gathering of his officers, thirty-six in all, and began drinking with them. When the wine had moun- ted into their heads a little, he tried to rouse their spirit still further by addressing them thus: �Gentlemen, here we are in the heart of an isolated region, anxious to achieve riches and honor by some great exploit. Now it happens that an ambassador from the Hsiung-no arrived in this kingdom only a few days ago, and the result is that the respectful courtesy extended towards us by our royal host has disappeared. Should this envoy prevail upon him to seize our party and hand us over to the Hsiung-no, our bones will become food for the wolves of the desert. What are we to do?� With one accord, the officers replied: �Standing as we do in peril of our lives, we will follow our commander through life and death.� For the sequel of this adventure, see chap. XII. ss. 1, note.] 1. We cannot enter into alliance with neighboring princes until we are ac- quainted with their designs. We are not fit to lead an army on the march un- less we are familiar with the face of the country�its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps. We shall be unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we make use of local guides. CHAPTER 12. THE NINE SITUATIONS 109 [These three sentences are repeated from VII.
