shine among the highest. Thus nature and art are both needed, and application sets on them the seal. Arouse no Exaggerated Expectations on entering. It is the usual ill-luck of all celebrities not to ful�l afterwards the expectations beforehand formed of them. The real can never equal the imagined, for it is easy to form ideals but very di.cult to realise them. Imagination weds Hope and gives birth to much more than things are in themselves. However great the excellences, they never su.ce to ful�l expectations, and as men �nd themselves disappointed with their exorbitant expectations they are more ready to be disillusionised than to admire. Hope is a great falsi�er of truth; let skill guard against this by ensuring that fruition exceeds desire. A few creditable attempts at the beginning are su.cient to arouse curiosity without pledging one to the �nal object. It is better that reality should surpass the design and is better than was thought. This rule does not apply to the wicked, for the same exaggeration is a great aid to them; they are defeated amid general applause, and what seemed at �rst extreme ruin comes to be thought quite bearable. A Man of the Age. The rarest individuals depend on their age. It is not every one that �nds the age he deserves, and even when he �nds it he does not always know how to utilise it.

Others do better, and press forward and pro�t by their clever boldness, reaching the goddess and winning her favour on the wings of their virtue and valour. But on a true philosophy there is no other umpire than virtue and insight; for there is no luck or ill-luck except wisdom and the reverse. A Man of Knowledge to the Point. Wise men arm themselves with tasteful and elegant erudition; a practical knowledge of what is going on not of a common kind but more like an expert. They possess a copious store of wise and witty sayings, and of noble deeds, and know how to employ them on �tting occasions. More is often taught by a jest than by the most serious teaching. Pat knowledge helps some more than the seven arts, be they ever so liberal. xxiii Be Spotless: the indispensable condition of perfection. Few live without some weak point, either physical or moral, which they pamper because they could easily cure it. The keenness of others often regrets to see a slight defect attaching itself to a whole
