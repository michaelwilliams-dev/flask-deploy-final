could make opponents lose contact between front and back lines, lose reliability between large and small groups, lose mutual concern for the welfare of the different social classes among them, lose mutual accommodation between the rulers and the ruled, lose enlistments among the soldiers, lose coherence within the armies. They went into action when it was advantageous, stopped when it was not. LI QUAN They set up changes to confuse their opponents, striking them here and there, terrorizing and disarraying them in such a way that they had no time to plan. Master Sun It may be asked, when a large, well-organized opponent is about to come to you, how do you deal with it? The answer is that you first take away what they like, and then they will listen to you. WANG XI First occupy a position of advantage, and cut off their supply routes by special strike forces, and they will do as you plan. CHEN HAO What they like does not only mean the advantages they rely on, it means that anything enemies care about is worth capturing. Master Sun The condition of a military force is that its essential factor is speed, taking advantage of others� failure to catch up, going by routes they do not expect, attacking where they are not on guard. CHEN HAO This means that to take advantage of unpreparedness, lack of foresight, or lack of caution on the part of opponents, it is necessary to proceed quickly, it won�t work if you hesitate. Master Sun In general, the pattern of invasion is that invaders become more intense the farther they enter alien territory, to the point where the native rulership cannot overcome them. DU MU The pattern of invasive attack is that if they enter deeply into enemy territory, soldiers come to have the determination to fight to the death�they are singleminded, so the native rulers cannot beat them. Master Sun Glean from rich fields, and the armies will have enough to eat. Take care of your health and avoid stress, consolidate your energy and build up your strength. Maneuver your troops and assess strategies so as to be unfathomable. WANG XI Consolidate your keenest energy, save up your extra strength, keep your form concealed and your plans secret, being unfathomable to enemies, waiting for a vulnerable gap to advance upon. Master Sun Put them in a spot where they have no place to go, and they will die before fleeing. If they are to die there, what can they not do? Warriors exert their full strength. When warriors are in great danger, then they have no fear. When there is nowhere to go they are firm, when they are deeply involved they stick to it. If they have no choice, they will fight. CAO CAO When people are desperate, they will fight to the death. Master Sun For this reason the soldiers are alert without being drilled, enlist without being drafted, are friendly without treaties, are trustworthy without commands.
