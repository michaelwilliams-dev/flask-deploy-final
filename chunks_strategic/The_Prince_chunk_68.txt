(Review) This antiwar novel is set in post-World War II Italy where Samuele, a young soldier ill with consumption, returns to his village much changed by the hor.rors he witnessed in battle. Always hot tempered, he is now more ac.cepting of human foibles. This contrasts sharply with the harsh tradi.tions of the village. A young married wo-man pays with her life for a momentary indiscretion, and many feel her murder justified. Not Samuele, who tracks down her killer, who happens to be her husband and his friend. The obelisk of the title is a tall, intricately detailed struc.ture that must be transported using dangerous maneuvers, but Samuele uses his waning strength to lead the effort in bringing this symbol of love and peace to the town square. Although not poetic, the writing is competent and does evoke the reality of village life.Library Journal May 1995. Cl. ISBN 0-8283-2005-5, $24.95.
