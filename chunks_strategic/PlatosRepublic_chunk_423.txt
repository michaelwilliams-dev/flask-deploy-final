over poetry in particular). Socrates takes a line from the poetic attack on philoso? phy and uses it as part of the philosophic attack on poetry. He says poetry grounds its appeal on the prejudices of conventional morality. Socrates uses the emphatically masculine aner (cf. 32 c, note 14) at the beginning of the sentence. It is the male who laughs at womanliness; Soc? rates defends the human being. Poetry is tacitly identified with manliness and hence with the city and the political. The limitations of manliness begin to emerge in this passage. The male, the warrior who defends the city, is not open to philosophy and is only incompletely human. 1. The word translated as "wave" also means "foetus." [Cf. Theaetetus, 149 ff. and 210b, where words related to this one (in the latter sense) abound. Socrates claims (at 210b) that he is only an intellectual mid? wife and not himself capable of a pregnancy. That statement may not be wholly adequate, for here we are to see three of his own brain-children.] 2. This could also be translated "the female song," as in the "female drama" at 451a. (Cf. also 365e, note 18.) 3. The marriage of Zeus and Hera was known as' the "Sacred Mar? ri.age," and it was celebrated in many Greek cities including Athens. They were, of course, brother and sister. ï¿½ 19. A place where lambs, kids, and calves were raised. This whole passage compares the mating and procreation of men to those of animals. The sacred marriages apparently take their standard, not from the gods, but from the beasts. 20. Aristophanes, Ecclesiazusae, 634-638. 21. An examination of this prescription will reveal that the prohibitions against incest are relaxed even more than this generous dispensation would seem to indicate (cf. 463c). 22. The Greek word for "ruler" is archon. In-Athens the holders of the chief offices were called "archons." 23. The Greek word translated as "outsider" is allotrion, meaning "belonging to another," "alien"; it is the opposite of oikeion, "what is one's own," "what belongs to one's O\VD household/' ltis thesame word usedJ>y Thrasymachus in describing justice. as "someone else's good" (343c), and this passage refers to that one. In.the good city everything is one's own, part of one's household, so there can be no interest for one group to oppress another any more than a normal father is interested in oppressing his children. This tacitly admits that Thrasymachus' characterization of justice applies to exist? ing cities. 20. Cf. 415d, note 67. 21. Cf. Apology, 36d. 22. Hesiod, Works and Days, 40. 23. Pedagogue-a man who took children back and forth from school, a sort of supervisor. Among the Athenians he was usually a slave. 24. Iliad, VII, 321. (Cf. Aristophanes, Ecclesiazusae, 677-679.) 25. Iliad, VIII, 162. 26. Those who live in the golden age celebrated by Hesiod (Works and Days, 109-120). 27. Socrates alters Hesiod's text: he uses "they become" instead of "they are called," and "endowed with speech" instead of "mortal." This
