Those earlier views arenotproved false here, but itismanifest that in such aworld nobility andjustice havenocosmic support; lowcanwin over high, andthenoble things canbeinconflict with thenecessary onesandwitheach other. Inthenewtheology thehigher isnotderived from thelower, andthegood isfirst. Similarly, thegodsthemselves are [.352 ] Interpretive Essay notrepresentatives ofbecoming asopposed tobeing; ofallthings, they arethemostunchanging; theyarenotmoved bythedesires ofthebody which arethesignofweakness andchange anddependence. Primacy is given torestand eternity overmotion and time.Thegods area prefiguration oftheideaswhich areknown tothephilosophers. The manwhobelieves inthese gods, while loving thecityandjustice, will nothateandconsider impious thephilosopher whoteaches theideas. Afurther important consequence ofthediscussion about thegods follows fromthefactthatthegodsdonot lie.Inthediscussion withCeph- alus itwasindicated that just ashuman justice sometimes requires notrepaying debts, soitsometimes requires nottelling thetruth. That godsnever liewould seem toimply thattheyhave nothing todowith menandarenottheir friends. Theworld inwhichmen livecontains evilaswell asgood, and,although thedominance ofthegood inthe cosmos atlarge isreassuring forthehuman estate, itdoesnotperfect it. Mencannot live likethegods. Laterwearetold that rulers must lie; hence thegods arenotrulers, andrulers cannot imitate thevirtues of gods. Statesmen require ahuman prudence inwhich thegodscangive themnoguidance. Thisreform ofthepoetic account ofthegods leads totheconsequence that inthefuture thepoetic depictions ofthegods cannot serve asmodels forhuman conduct. {386a-392c) These beliefs about thegods, Socrates says, will make thewarriors menwhohonor thegodsandancestors andwhoare serious about their friendship withoneanother. Thismeans thatthe proper opinions about thegods willcause thewarriors tobebothpious andjust inthecommon meanings ofthese terms. Nextcomes courage, thevirtue governing andperfecting spiritedness. Itdoesnotdepend so much onbeliefs about thegods,whose place isusually held tobeinthe heavens, butonbeliefs about Hades, thehome ofthedead, which is generally thought tobebeneath theearth. Homer's description of Hades isrepulsive andfrightening, andSocrates asserts thatmenwho believe itcannot becourageous. Here Socrates' critique iscompletely negative; hesimply sayssuch things must notbesaid.Hedoes not,as hedidwith thegods, tellwhatmustbesaid.Hedoesnoteven saythat Hades exists orthatthere isany lifeafter death. Theexistence ofsome kindofgodsseems lessquestionable than theexistence ofanafterlife. Strangely, Socrates insists only thatdeath should notbefrightening, without paying anyattention tothesalutary effect such fearmight have. Apparently, itisnotonly thewarriors who areliberated from their terrors about alifetocome, butalsomen likeCephalus. This ter- [353 ] THEREPUBLIC rorcaused Cephalus totrytolivejustly inhisoldage.But italsomade himunable toparticipate inthisdiscussion. Socrates islooking for another way tomakemenlove justice, onpwhich does notforcethem toturnaway from this lifeandtobehostile toreason. Socrates wishes toexpunge allofthese disagreeable stories about Hades from theliterature. But insodoing heseems todestroy thevir- tueofcourage. Ifthere isnothing terrible indeath, then thesacrifice of life isnotparticularly praiseworthy. Itwould notrequire theovercom- ingoffear. Socrates' intention isnot,however, toturnthewarriors into dependable automatons. Histrueintention comes tolight intheseven quotations fromHomer, concerning Hades, hecites atthebeginning of thispartofthediscussion. Allbutthecentral onehave todomore or lessdirectly with Achilles; soindeed domost oftheHomeric passages cited inwhat remains ofthediscussion ofpoetry. Socrates brings Achilles totheforeground inorder toanalyze hischaracter and ul- timately todoaway withhimasthemodel fortheyoung. Thefigure of Achilles, more thananyteaching orlaw,compels thesouls ofGreeks and allmenwhopursue glory.Heistheheroofheroes, admired andimi- tatedbyall.And this iswhat Socrates wishes tocombat; heteaches that ifAchilles isthemodel, men willnotpursue philosophy, thatwhat he stands forisinimical tothefounding ofthebest cityandthepractice of thebestwayoflife.Socrates isengaging inacontest withHomer forthe titleofteacher oftheGreeksâ€” orofmankind. Oneofhisprincipal goals istoputhimself intheplace ofAchilles astheauthentic representation ofthebesthuman type.Oneneedonlylook attheirphysical descriptions torecognize thattheyarepolar opposites. Socrates isattempting towork afantastic transformation ofmen's tastes inmaking theuglyoldman more attractive than thefairyouth. Now, itisperfectly obvious that Achilles, although hebelieved thatHades wasadreadful place, was stillable tobecourageous. Soc- rates cannot seriously mean that theview ofHades presented by Homer necessarily makes aman acoward.
