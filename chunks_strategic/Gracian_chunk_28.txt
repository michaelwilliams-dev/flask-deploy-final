foolish presumption or pompous talk, but in a becoming tone of authority born of superior talent combined with true merit. Avoid Affectation. The more merit, the less a.ectation, which gives a vulgar �avour to all. It is wearisome to others and troublesome to the one a.ected, for he becomes a martyr to care and tortures himself with attention. The most eminent merits lose most by it, for they appear proud and arti�cial instead of being the product of nature, and the natural is always more pleasing than the arti�cial. One always feels sure that the man who a.ects a virtue has it not. The more pains you take with a thing, the more should you conceal them, so that it may appear to arise spontaneously from your own natural character. Do not, however, in avoiding a.ectation fall into it by a.ecting to be una.ected. The sage never seems to know his own merits, for only by not noticing them can you call others' attention to them. He is twice great who has all the perfections in the opinion of all except of himself; he attains applause by two opposite paths. Get Yourself missed. Few reach such favour with the many; if with the wise 'tis the height of happiness. When one has �nished one's work, coldness is the general rule.

It is no great gain if a poor successor makes the predecessor seem good, for this does not imply that the one is missed, but that the other is wished away. cxxv Do not be a Black List. It is a sign of having a tarnished name to concern oneself with the ill-fame of others. Some wish to hide their own stains with those of others, or at least wash them away: or they seek consolation therein--'tis the consolation of fools. They must have bad breath who form the sewers of scandal for the whole town. The more one grubs about in such matters, the more one befouls oneself. There are few without stain somewhere or other, but it is of little known people that the failings are little known. Be careful then to avoid being a registrar of faults. That is to be an abominable thing, a man that lives without a heart. Folly consists not in committing Folly, but in not hiding it when committed. You should keep your desires sealed up, still more your defects. All go wrong sometimes, but the wise try to hide the errors, but fools boast of them. Reputation depends more on what is hidden than on what is done; if a man does not live chastely, he must live cautiously. The errors of great men are like
