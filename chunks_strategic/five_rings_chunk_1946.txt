"Those," Isaid, "thatwake upinsleepwhen therestofthe soul— allthatbelongs tothecalculating, tame, and ruling part of it—slumbers, while thebeastly andwild part, gorged with food or [251 ] socrates/adeimantus theREPUBLIq 571c drink, isskittish and,pushing sleep away, seeks togoand satisfyits dispositions. Youknow that insuch astate itdares todoeverythingas though itwere released from, and ridof,allshame andprudence.
