plot. [The reading here is uncertain. Li Ch�uan indicates "a treaty confirmed by 1. CHAPTER 10. THE ARMY ON THE MARCH 82 oaths and hostages." Wang Hsi and Chang Yu, on the other hand, simply say "without reason," "on a frivolous pretext."] 27. When there is much running about [Every man hastening to his proper place under his own regimental ban- ner.] and the soldiers fall into rank, it means that the critical moment has come. 28. When some are seen advancing and some retreating, it is a lure. 29. When the soldiers stand leaning on their spears, they are faint from want of food. 30. If those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking themselves, the army is suffering from thirst. [As Tu Mu remarks: "One may know the condition of a whole army from the behavior of a single man."] 31. If the enemy sees an advantage to be gained and makes no effort to secure it, the soldiers are exhausted. 32. If birds gather on any spot, it is unoccupied. [A useful fact to bear in mind when, for instance, as Ch�en Hao says, the enemy has secretly abandoned his camp.] Clamor by night betokens nervousness. 33. If there is disturbance in the camp, the general�s authority is weak. If the banners and flags are shifted about, sedition is afoot. If the officers are angry, it means that the men are weary. [Tu Mu understands the sentence differently: "If all the officers of an army are angry with their general, it means that they are broken with fatigue" owing to the exertions which he has demanded from them.] 34. When an army feeds its horses with grain and kills its cattle for food, [In the ordinary course of things, the men would be fed on grain and the horses chiefly on grass.] and when the men do not hang their cooking-pots over the camp- fires, showing that they will not return to their tents, you may know that they are determined to fight to the death. [I may quote here the illustrative passage from the HOU HAN SHU, ch. 71, given in abbreviated form by the P�EI WEN YUN FU: "The rebel Wang Kuo of Liang was besieging the town of Ch�en- ts�ang, and Huang- fu Sung, who was in supreme command, and Tung Cho were sent out CHAPTER 10. THE ARMY ON THE MARCH 83 against him. The latter pressed for hasty measures, but Sung turned a deaf ear to his counsel. At last the rebels were utterly worn out, and began to throw down their weapons of their own accord. Sung was not advancing to the attack, but Cho said: �It is a principle of war not to pursue desperate men and not to press a retreating host.� Sung answered: �That does not apply here. What I am about to attack is a jaded army, not a retreating host; with disciplined troops I am falling on a disorganized multitude, not a band of
