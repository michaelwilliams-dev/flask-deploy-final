He [361 ] THEREPUBLIC asserts thatthepossession ofvirtue assures victory; technical skilland chance playnorole.This isanunwarranted assertion, asanyexperience oflifewillshow. But itisnotentirely implausible within thecontext of this city. Itwillsoonbecome evident thatthese warriors willdolittle if anyfighting outside thecity,thatthecitywillhave little foreign policy, andthattheir function ismuchmore tocontrol thevices ofthedesiring orwage-earning class. Therefore thecontrol ofthewarriors' predatary inclinations andtheencouragement oftheir dedication tothecommon good ismore important than their fighting skill. But, still, Socrates' whole treatment ofthegood cityseems toneglect theproblems in- volved ingetting andkeeping thethings which make thegood city possible. This neglect, however, isdeliberate, andrecognizing itmakes oneaware oftheproblem ofthegood cityandthegood life— that is, thatthere isatension between theactivities necessary topreserve life andthose necessary tolive itwell.The satisfaction ofthebody's de- mands, which isthepre-condition ofliving anykindofgood lifeatall, caneasily become anend initself. Socrates directs hisattention ex- clusively totheperfection ofthesoul, asthough itsdemands were in perfect harmony with those ofthebody, forthedifficulty posed bythe body ismade clearandprecise onlybyacting asthough itdidnotexist, oratleast asthough itsdemands never contradict those ofagood city orphilosophy. Thediscussion ofgymnastic isinkeeping with theneglect ofthe bodywhich characterizes theentire Republic. Butinthiscasethebody ispeculiarly difficult toneglect, and itwould seem thathere Socrates would have toadmit thatman isadualbeing anddiscuss therelation of body and soul.However hecontinues toinsist that hiswarriors are simple, asopposed tocomplex, beings. Thecause ofahealthy body isa healthy soul;and ifabody doesbecome diseased, nature must be allowed totake itscourse. Inother words, weareasked tobelieve that thesoulcontrols thebody perfectly, thatgood souls cannot bejoined to badbodies and, atthesame time, aretold toforget theevidence tothe contrary provided bysickmenandtheexistence ofanartofmedicine which ministers tomen's bodies andnottheir souls. Inevitably, then, since gymnastic has little todoinkeeping men's bodies healthy, thediscussion turns from adescription ofgymnastic in- toanattack onmedicine which looks tothecare ofdiseased bodies without regard tothehealth ofthesoul.Doctors, according toSocrates, arerequired incities forthesame reason asjudges—because there isa failure ofmoderation. When men desire toomuch, they takefrom others andmust appear before ajudge; thesame inflamed desire also disrupts thebody's harmony, andthementhus diseased must submit [362 ] Interpretive Essay themselves toadoctor. Immoderation isthecause ofallillsofbody and city.Both judges anddoctors should bekeptoutofthecity as much aspossible. Theparticular object ofSocrates' apparent scorn is Herodicus, thefounder ofadvanced andcomplex medicine, whowasa sicklymanandinvented anartwhich kept hisruined body alive.The valetudinarian isridiculous anddangerous because hesubordinates everything tokeeping himself aliveandhasnothing toliveforbutthat life; ifhiskind ofcaring forlifewere tobecome general inacity,the city's virtue would beundermined, everything initwould beharnessed tothatpurpose— thesoulwould exist forthebody rather thanthebody forthesoul. Socrates opposes complex medicine with asimple, goodmedicine which wasfounded bythedivine Asclepius and isdescribed byHomer. Asclepius usedready methods which didnotrequire thequest forrare medicines oranychange inthepatient's wayoflife.Ifthesemethods didnot suffice, thepatient wasallowed todie.Thismayseem likea crude artofmedicine, butAsclepius didnotadopt itoutofignorance butbecause hewaspolitical orstatesmanlike, meaning headapted the artofmedicine tothecommon good. Thiskind ofmedicine doesnot threaten thepractice ofthevirtues andthesimple devotion tothem; it does notemancipate thebodyandpermit ittohave alifeofitsown. Thus Socrates finds inHomer atwin tothesimple poetry hehasjust elaborated inopposition toHomer. Complex poetry causes men toat- tachtoomuch significance towhat isperishable, towhat istheirown; complex medicine causes men toattach toomuch significance totheir bodies. Perhaps thetwoerrors arereally thesame.Asthenewpoetry is intended tomakemenstrong inthelossoftheir lives, their properties, and their loved ones, theoldmedicine wasintended tomake them strong inthedisease oftheir bodies. Although Socrates' concern with thecitizens' performing their du- tiesmakes hisbanishment ofHerodicus' medicine comprehensible and even justifiable, itdoesnotdoaway withthefactthatHerodicus knew much more about thebody
