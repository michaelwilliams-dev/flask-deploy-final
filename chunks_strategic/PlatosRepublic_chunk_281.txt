one deviates from the letter of the law-which is equivalent to stating the purpose for which laws are instituted. (33ld-336a) Polemarchus inherits his father's duty of defending the law and hence of defending that property which he is going to inherit. He fails in his attempt to define justice in a way which is con? sistent with the maintenance of private property, and the Republic culmi? nates in the elaborationï¿½of a regime in which the only title to property is virtue and which is hence communistic. Polemarchus' original intention when he interrupted was merely to support his father's conten? tion that one should pay what is owed. He does so by citing the authority of a poet. In his case, however (as opposed to that of Ceph? alus), poetic authority apparently does not refer to the even greater authority of the gods; he expresses his own view. Socrates can, with greater propriety, call into question the opinions of the young Polemar? chus based on the authority of Simoni des than the dogmas of the pious old Cephalus based on the authority of the traditions about the gods. But even here Socrates does not criticize the authority; he merely asks Polemarchus to interpret. Socrates makes the ironic assumption that Si? monides must be right and that, since he is right, his views must accord with the results of rational argument. Polemarchus is compelled to learn how to argue; this is the first step on the road from unconditional acceptance of the ance tral order to the new regime based on reason in which the authority of the father's opinions and the power of his prop? erty play no role. By the end of his discussion with Socrates, Polemar? chus is aware that he cannot get help from Simonides and that he must himself find reasons if he is to be satisfied with his beliefs about justice. Finally he and Socrates join in agreeing that Simonides could not have said what Polemarchus asserted he said, for it is unreasonable and base. Simonides remains respectable, but only because it is assumed that he accepts the authority of Polemarchus and Socrates who are now free of him. Polemarchus is the last participant in the discussion who attempts to use an authority as a sufficient cause for belief. Immediately after him comes Thrasymachus with his own definition of justice. Polemarchus insists that justice is paying what one owes, but Socrates again poses the same objection that silenced his father. In order to save his definition Polemarchus must alter the sense of owing. Now justice is not giving back to any man what he has deposited but giving good things to friends. In general this would mean following Cephalus' rule, but it accounts for the exceptions: one need not aid a man who in? tends to do one damage-he must be a friend; and one must look to the good of the other party, as Cephalus did not do. Two great themes emerge: friendship, or community,
