it is told that Homer suffered consid? erable neglect in his own day, when he was alive." "Yes, that is told," I said. "But, Glaucon, if Homer were really able to educate human beings and make them better because he is in these things capable not of imitating but of knowing, do you suppose that he wouldn't have made many comrades and been honored and cherished by them? But Protagoras, the Abderite, after all, and Pro: dicus, the Cean,5 and very many others are able, by private in? tercourse, to impress upon the men of their time the assurance that they will be able to govern neither home nor city unless they themselves supervise their education, and they are so intensely loved for this wisdom that their comrades do everything but carry them about on their heads. Then do you suppose that if he were able to help human beings toward virtue, the men in Homer's time would have let him or Hesiod go around being rhapsodes and wouldn't have clung to them rather than to their gold? And wouldn't they have compelled these teachers to stay with them at home; or, if they weren't persuaded, wouldn't they themselves have attended6 them wherever they went, until they had gained an adequate education?" "In my opinion, Socrates," he said, "what you say is entirely true." "Shouldn't we set down all those skilled in making, beginning with Homer, as imitators of phantoms of virtue and of the other sub? jects of their making? They don't lay hold of the truth; rather, as we were just now saying, the painter will make what seems to be a shoemaker to those who understand as little about shoemaking as he understands, but who observe only colors and shapes." --Most certainly." "Then, in this way, I suppose we'll claim the poetic man also uses names and phrases to color each of the arts. He himself doesn't understand; but he imitates in such a way as to seem, to men whose condition is like his own and who observe only speeches, to speak very well. He seems to do so when he speaks using meter, rhythm, 600a b C d e 601 a 601 a b C and harmony, no matter whether the subject is shoemaking, general? ship, or anything else. So great is the charm that these things by na? ture possess. For when the things of the poets are stripped of the colors of the music and are said alone, by themselves, I suppose you know how they look. For you, surely, have seen." ''I have indeed," he said. "Don't they," I said; "resemble the faces of the boys who are youthful but not fair in what happens to their looks when the bloom has forsaken them?" "Exactly," he said. "Come now, reflect on this. The maker of the phantom, the imitator, we say, understands nothing of what is but rather of what looks like it is. Isn't that so?" ''Yes.ï¿½ "Well, then, let's not
