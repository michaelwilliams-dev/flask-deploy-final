with the short sword 1. �The virtue of the sword,� tachi no toku: On the meaning of the word toku, see �Toku� in the appendix. I have translated toku as �virtue,� but this word can also mean �interest� or �advantage.� The nuance of �virtue� seemed to me to be present in the sense in which Musashi employs the term here in relation to the sword. 2. �Persevere�: in this sentence Musashi uses the term migaku, which means �to polish� and which I have translated �to persevere.� Musashi frequently uses the term migaku in the sense of �persevere, develop oneself, study in depth,� and the like. This expression is frequently used in the realm of the arts. 3. �Appropriately�: ideau or deau, meaning �to meet, to face, to coincide, to adjust to, to suit the situation.� 4. �If you compare the two . . . ,� yari wa sente nari, naginata wa ushirode nari: I rendered Musashi�s comparison as I did in view of the following: � Sente means �precede somebody in an act, do something before someone else, attack before someone else, fight at the head (of a group), take the initiative by attacking first.� � Ushirode or gote means �the back of a person or a thing.� When it is opposed to sente, it designates �someone who lags behind, who lets the other take the initiative.� 1. The expression torikomori mono could also refer to the opposite situation: �when you are attacking one or more enemies who are shut up in a house� or �whom you have encircled and who are on the defensive.� 2. �Indoors�: This is the translation of zashiki. This refers to training taking place in a covered hall. This phrase confirms that in Musashi�s time, the quest for technical subtlety began to be a trend. According to Musashi, this takes you away from the practice of effective combat. This trend was further accentuated later on. 3. �They will not be appropriate . . . The bow is appropriate.� In both cases, the verb is deau. 1. One ken equals 1.8 meters; twenty ken, the measure given here, is thus equivalent to 36 meters. 2. �The interest is great�: This sentence, which is incomplete in the copy that has come down to us, is written as follows: Sono ri ooshi. I think this phrase is a copying error, taking the place of sukunashi. In that case, the translation would be �This does not have much interest.� Indeed, in many transcriptions into modern Japanese, this sentence, which does not fit into the context, is dropped; also some texts adopt the sense of sukunashi. For example, Kamiko Tadashi, in his transcription, omits this sentence from his reference edition of the text of the Gorin no sho. (5, p. 60) Kamata Shigeo interprets it in the sense of sukunashi. He translates it into modern Japanese as �Sono riten wa sukunai.� (4, p. 81) Terayama Danchu keeps the expression sono ri ooshi, but he attaches it to the next sentence.
