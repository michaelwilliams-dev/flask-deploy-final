not necessarily lead totheconsequence thatonemust desire tobecome a tyrant, for itispossible tocare forthings which cannot beprocured by political life, forexample, philosophy. But, ingeneral, mostmendo careforthepolitical lifeorthings which canbestbeprocured byit.Soph- istsand rhetoricians extract the political significance from the philosophers' knowledge ofnature. They teach thattheproper study of politics isnotthelaws orjustice, forthey arephantasms, butrhetoric, themeans ofgetting one's way.Atbest, then, thestudy ofnature ap- parently leads toindifference tothecityand itslaws; atworst itleads totyranny. Thiswasthesuspicion oftheAthenian deiiu>s, and itmay verywellbethecase.Devotion tojustice ortheopposite isnotsimply a question ofdecency orcorruption butoneofthetruth ofthings. And if whatThrasymachus teaches isthetruth, thecity inself-defense must suppress that truth. Itmayberecalled thatSocrates wasaccused ofbeing aproponent ofthispre-Socratic philosophy soinimical tothecity's interest anda teacher ofrhetoric. TheRepiihlic defends Socrates against thisaccusa- tion:hereheisshown tobetheprotector ofjustice against arhetori- cian.Ofcourse, hedoes notsimply defend thejustice oftheancestral laws ofthe city; his isaphilosophic response toaphilosophic challenge, andtherefore it,too, issubversive oftheancestral. This response cannot merely beanexhortation tothepractice ofjustice; it must alsoattempt tofind anatural support forjustice. Thestudy of justice therefore leads tothestudy ofnature; thecharacter ofjustice depends onthecharacter ofnature asawhole. Hence theRepublic, beginning with justice, mustbeacomprehensive book. Inbeing forced todefend justice, Socrates isforced toenter forbidden realms and to expound novel conceits. Innocence once lostcannot beregained; the substitute isphilosophizing inthefullest sense. [338 1 IIInterpretive Essay Although Socrates isnotdepicted asapractitioner ofrhetoric, his appeal toGlaucon andAdeimantus stems from akind ofrhetoric which succeeded insilencing themaster rhetorician Thrasymachus without truly refuting him.Socrates controlled thediscussion from the outset insuch away astoinvolve them while, and in,posing theprob- lemofjustice initsmost radical form.Theconfrontation withThra- symachus wasinasense carried onforGlaucon's benefit. Socrates' suc- cess atperplexing and attracting Glaucon wasseenwhen Glaucon could notrestrain himself from intenupting toexpress hiswonder at Socrates' assertion thatpunishment isafonm ofwage fornjlers. Both Socrates andThrasymachus, fortheir various reasons, areinterested in these twomenâ€” young, teachable, andambitious. Among thebestof theyouth, Glaucon andAdeimantus arepowerfully drawn toexcel in themosthonored pursuits, those inwhich theycanmost benefit both others andthemselves. That istosaythey aredrawn topolitics. And Thrasymachus offers them themeans ofsuccess, bothbythetools of persuasion hecanprovide andbytheliberating insight intothenature ofpolitical lifeonwhich histeaching isbased. Ineffect, Thrasymachus tellsthem that intheir pursuit ofglory theyneed notbehampered by considerations ofjustice. This isanattractive teaching, for itsimplifies things andgives them areasoned ground forgiving way tothose temptations which political lifealways presents, temptations which are usually resisted atthecommand oflawandshame. They areready to become Thrasymachus' students since reason andpassion combine to support him.ButSocrates proves tobethesuperior speaker. Somehow whatherepresents isstronger; hearouses their curiosity byshowing that hisrhetoric ismore powerful andbyappealing totheir nobility andloveofjustice. Socrates' paradoxical argument touches something inthem. This isthebeginning ofaneducation that willleadthem very farfrom anything theyhave everknown, buttheendofwhich follows inevitably from theconcerns withwhich theybegan. Before theycan turn toThrasymachus, they willhave toovercome Socrates. Thedaring andmanly Glaucon hasseen thatSocrates hasatbest shown onlythenecessity ofjustice andnot itsdesirability. More urbane thanThrasymachus, herecognizes thepower ofthereputation of justice. Therefore hedoesnothimself praise injustice butputstheargu- mentonitsbehalf inthemouth ofothers. Hepresents hismotivation as adesire toseejustice vindicated. Ofcourse, hedoesnothave tosella teaching about justice asdidThrasymachus. Thecontradiction between thepublic teaching ofinjustice andthepublic necessity fortheprofes- sionofjustice wasinherent inThrasymachus' situation, andGlaucon's [339 ] THEREPUBLIC situation doesnotinvolve him init.Heprofits from thelesson ofThra- symachus' discomfiture; hiding hispersonal doubts, heisablenever- theless tosatisfy hiscuriosity about thegoodness ofjustice. Hisvery mode ofpresenting hisdiscourse isamodel ofthehypocritical useof public professions ofjustice.
