OBSERVANCE OFTHE LAW Inthewinter of1872, theU.S. financier Asbury Harpending;wasvisiting London when hereceived acable: Adiamond mine had been discovered intheAmerican West. The cable came from areliable source—-William Ralston, owner oftheBank ofCalifomia—-but Harpendingnevertheless took itasapractical joke, probably inspired bythe recent discovery of huge diamond mines inSouth Africa. True, whenreportshad first come in ofgoldbeingdiscovered inthewestern United States, everyone had been skeptical,and those had turned out tobetrue. But adiamond mine inthe West‘ Haipendingshowed thecable tohisfellow financier Baron Roth schild (one oftherichest men intheworld), saying itmust be ajoke.The baron, however, replied, “Don’t betoo sure about that. America isavery large country. Ithasfurnished theworld with many surprises already.Per- hapsithasothers instore.” Harpending promptlytook thefirstshipback totheStates. When Harpendingreached SanFrancisco, there was anexcitement in theairrecalling theGold Rush days ofthelate 1840s. Two crusty prospec- torsnamed Philip Arnold andjohn Slack had been the ones tofind thedi- amond mine. Theyhad notdivulgeditslocation, inWyoming, buthad led .aliighly respected mining experttoitseveral weeks back, takingacircular route sohecould notguesshiswhereabouts. Once there, theexperthad watched astheminers dug updiamonds. Back inSan Francisco theexpert hadtaken thegemstovarious jewelers,oneofwhom had estimated their worth at$15 million. Ha:-pending and Ralston now asked Amold and Slack toaccompany them back toNew York, where thejewelerCharles Tiffanywould verify theoriginalestimates. The prospectors responded uneasily--theysmelled atrap: How could theymust these city slickers? Vifhat ifTiffanyand thefi- nanciers managedtosteal thewhole mine outfrom under them? Ralston tried toallay their fears bygivingthem $100,000 andplacinganother $300,000 inescrow forthem. Ifthedeal went through, they would bepaid anadditional $300,000. The miners agreed. Thelittlegrouptraveled toNew York, where ameetingwasheld atthe mansion ofSamuel L.Barlow. The cream ofthecity’s aristocracywas inat- tx-,ndance——General George Brinton McClellan, commander oftheUnion forces intheCivil War; General Benjamin Butler; Horace Greeley,editor ofthenewspapertheNew Ybrk Tribune; Harpending; Ralston; andTiffany. Only Slack and Arnold were missing—-as tourists inthecity,theyhad de- cided togosight-seeing. When Tiffanyannounced that thegemswere real andworth a.fortune, thefinanciers could barely control their excitement. Theywired Roth- _,schild andother tycoons totellthem about thediamond mine andinviting them toshare inthe investment. Atthe same time, theyalso told the prospectorsthatthey wanted one more test:Theyinsisted that aminingex- Ipertoftheir choosing accompanySlack andArnold tothesitetoverifyits 'wealth.
