If Homer saidthatChryses came bringing ransom forhisdaughter and as asuppliant totheAchaeans, especially tothekings, and after that didn't speak asthough hehadbecome Chryses but stillasHomer, you know that itwouldn't beimitation butsimple narrative. Itwould be something likethis— I'llspeak without meter; I'mnotpoetic: The e priest came andprayed thatthegods grantthem thecapture ofTroy andtheirown safety, andthattheyaccept compensation andfree his daughter outofreverence forthegod.When hehadsaid this,theothers thereshowed pious respect andconsented, butAgamemnon wasangry andordered himtoleave immediately andnottocome back again or elsehisscepter andthegod's chaplets wouldn't protect him.Before his daughter would befreed, hesaidshe'dgrow oldwithhiminArgos. He ordered himtogoaway andnotprovoke him ifhewished togethome 394a safely. Theoldmanheard andwasfrightened; hewentaway insilence. Butwhen hehadwithdrawn from thecamp, hemade agreat prayer to Apollo, calling upon thegodwith hisspecial names,'*^ reminding him andasking areturn ifanything hehadevergiven hadbeen pleasing, whether itwas inthebuilding oftemples orthesacrifice ofvictims. In return forthemhecalled down thegod's arrows ontheAchaeans in payment forhistears. That,mycomrade, "Isaid, "isthewaysimple b narrative without imitation comes topass." "Iunderstand," hesaid. "Now," Isaid,"understand thattheopposite ofthiscomes topass when someone takes outthepoet's connections between thespeeches andleaves theexchanges.' "That Iunderstand, too,"hesaid. "That's theway itiswith trage- dies." "Your supposition ismost correct," Isaid."Andnow Isuppose I canmake plain toyouwhat Icouldn't before. Ofpoetry and tale- c telling, onekindproceeds wholly byimitation—asyou say,tragedy andcomedy; another, by*^bepoet'sown report—this, ofcourse, you would findespecially indithyrambs; and stillanother byboth—this is found inepicpoetry andmany other places too, ifyouunderstand me. "Now," hesaid, "Igrasp whatyouwanted tosaythen." "And remember, too,thatbefore thisweasserted thatwhatmust besaidhadalready been stated, butthathow itmustbesaidhad stillto beconsidered."

"Idivine," hesaid, "that you're considering whether we'll admit tragedy andcomedy intothecityornot." "Perhaps," Isaid, "and perhaps something stillmore than this. You see, Imyself really don'tknow yet,butwherever theargument, likeawind, tends, thither mustwego." "What yousay isfine," hesaid. "Now, Adeimantus, reflect onwhether ourguardians ought tobe e imitators ornot.Ordoes thisfollow fromwhatwent before—thateach onewould doafinejob inone activity, butnotinmany, and ifhe should trytoputhishand tomany, hewould surely failofattaining fame inall?" "Ofcourse that'swhatwould happen." "Doesn't thesame argument alsohold forimitation—thesame man isn'table toimitate many things aswell asone?" "No,heisn't." "Then, he'll hardly pursue anyofthenoteworthy activities while 395a atthesame time imitating many things andbeing askilled imitator. Foreven intwokinds ofimitation thatseem close tooneanother, like writing comedy andtragedy, thesamemen aren't capable ofproducing good imitations inboth atthesame time.
