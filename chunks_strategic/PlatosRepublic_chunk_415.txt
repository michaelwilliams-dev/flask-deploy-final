The choruses for the tragedies and comedies were part of the public charge and, at Athens, were usually paid for and trained by rich citizens, who did so as part of their civic responsibility and as a mode of display. Book III 1. Odyssey, XI, 489-491. Achilles speaks. 2. Iliad, XX, 64-65. 3. Iliad, XXIII, 103-104. . 4. Odyssey, X, 495 (said of Teiresias). 5. Iliad, XVI, 856--857. 6. Iliad, XXIII, 100-101. 1. Oayssey, XXIV, 6--10. 8. The words "as is thought" are generally thought to be corrupt and to have been inserted in the text by a Christian scribe at some late date. 9. The word is epieikes, meaning "fair" or "decent man," the one who does what's fit. Epieikeia became the term used for equity in law. It is prac? tically a synonym for the quality of gentlemanliness. 10. Iliad, XXIV, 10-12. I have translated Homer's text. Plato substitutes "sailing" or "navigating" for "roaming," "on" for "along," and adds "unharvested." This apparently is a parody, but the text may be corrupt. 11. Iliad, XVIII, 23-24. 12. Iliad, XXII, 414-415. 13. Iliad, XVIII, 54. 14. Iliad, XXII, 168-169. Socrates replaces "wall" by "town." 15. Iliad, XVI, 433-434. 16. Iliad, I, 599-600. 17. 346a, note 41.

But it gains a broader sense and gradually, in this work, comes to apply to a control of cer? tain pleasures of the soul that we would hardly designate as temperance. The word "moderation" covers both senses, although not so decisively as "temper? ance" in the first instance. In order to maintain the unity of the two notions as Socrates develops them, moderation will be used throughout. Sophrosyne is .one of the four cardinal virtues-the others are wisdom; courage, and justice. 8. Iliad, IV, 412. 9. The first line is Iliad, ill, 8, with the words "in silence" dropped; the seccnd is IV, 431. 10. Iliad, I, 225. 11. Odyssey, IX, 8-IO. Odysseus, at the court of the Phleacians, says in this passage that among the "finest of all things" is a whole people in harmony listening to a singer. 12. Odyssey, XII, 342.
