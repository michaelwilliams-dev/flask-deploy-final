PlaytheVirgin Queen:Give them hope but never satisfaction. OBSERVANCE OFTHE LAW When QueenElizabeth Iascended thethrone ofEngland,in1558, there was much to-do about herfindingahusband. The issue was debated inPar- liament, and was a.main topic ofconversation among Englishmen ofall classes; theyoften disagreedastowhom sheshouldmarry,buteveryone thoughtsheshould marryassoon aspossible,for aqueenmust have a king,and must bear heirs forthekingdom. The debates ragedonforyears. Meanwhile the most handsome andeligiblebachelors intherealm-Sir Robert Dudley,theEarl ofEssex, SirWalterRa.leigh———vied forElizabetlfs hand. Shedidnotdiscourage them, butsheseemed tobeinnohurry,and her hints astowhich man might beher favorite often contradicted each other. In1566, Parliament sent adelegationtoElizabeth urgingher to marrybefore she was toooldtobear children. Shedidnotargue,nordid shediscourage thedelegation, butsheremained avirginnonetheless. The delicategamethat Elizabeth playedwith her suitors slowlymade her thesubject ofinnumerable sexual fantasies and the objectofcultish worship.The court physician,Simon Forman, used hisdiarytodescribe hisdreams ofdefloweringher.

Throughout Europe, kings andprincesknew that amarriage with Eliz- abeth would seal analliance between Englandand anynation. Theking of Spainwooed her, asdidtheprinceofSweden and thearchduke ofAustria. Shepolitely refused them all. The great diplomaticissue ofElizabetlfs daywasposed bytherevolt oftheFlemish andDutch Lowlands, which were then possessions ofSpain. Should England break itsalliance with Spainand choose France asitsmain allyontheContinent, thereby encouragingFlemish and Dutch indepen- dence? By1570 ithad come toseem that analliance with France would be England’s wisest course. France had twoeligiblemen ofnoble blood, the dukes ofAnjouandAlencon, brothers oftheFrench king. Would either of them marryElizabeth? Both hadadvantages,and Elizabeth keptthehopes ofboth alive. The issue simmered foryears. The duke ofAnjoumade sev- eral visits toEngland,kissed Elizabeth inpublic,even called herbypet names; sheappearedtorequitehisaffections. Meanwhile, assheflirted with the two brothers,atreatywas signedthat sealedpeacebetween France and England. By1582 Elizabeth felt she could break offthe courtship.Inthe case oftheduke ofAnjouinparticular,shedid sowith greatrelief: For the sake ofdiplomacyshe had allowed herself tobe courted byaman whosepresenceshe could not stand and whom
