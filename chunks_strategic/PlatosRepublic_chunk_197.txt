when he didn't know about the change, and then again when he did know it? Or do you want to listen while I do the divining?" "That's what I want," he said. "Well, then," I said, "I divine that in the time when he doesn't know the truth he would be more likely to honor his father and his mother and the others who seem to be his kin than those who flatter him. And he would be less likely to overlook any of their needs, less likely to do or say anything unlawful to them, and less likely to disobey them in the important things than the flatterers." "That's to be expected," he said. "And, when he has become aware of that which is, I divine that now he would relax his honor and zeal for these people and intensify them for the flatterers, be persuaded by them a great deal more than before, and begin to live according to their ways, and have unconcealed relations with them. For that father and the rest of the adoptive kin, unless he is by nature particularly decent, he wouldn't care." "Everything you say," he said, "is just the sort of thing that would happen.

"Then," I said, "when he doesn't believe, as he did before, that these things are honorable or akin to him, and doesn't find the true ones, is it to be expected that he will go to any other sort of life than the one that flatters hirn?"30 "No, it isn't," he said. "Then, I suppose, he will seem to have become an outlaw from having been a law-abiding man." "Necessarily." "Isn't it to be expected," I said, "that this is what will happen to
