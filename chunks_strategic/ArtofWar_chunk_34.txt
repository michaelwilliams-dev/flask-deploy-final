[As Ho Shih remarks: "War is not a thing to be trifled with." Sun Tzu here reiterates the main lesson which this chapter is intended to enforce."] 15. Thus it may be known that the leader of armies is the arbiter of the people�s fate, the man on whom it depends whether the nation shall be in peace or in peril. Chapter 4 ATTACK BY STRATAGEM 1. Sun Tzu said: In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy�s country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good. So, too, it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them. [The equivalent to an army corps, according to Ssu-ma Fa, consisted nom- inally of 12500 men; according to Ts�ao Kung, the equivalent of a regi- ment contained 500 men, the equivalent to a detachment consists from any number between 100 and 500, and the equivalent of a company contains from 5 to 100 men. For the last two, however, Chang Yu gives the exact figures of 100 and 5 respectively.] 1. Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy�s resistance without fighting. [Here again, no modern strategist but will approve the words of the old Chinese general. Moltke�s greatest triumph, the capitulation of the huge French army at Sedan, was won practically without bloodshed.] 1. Thus the highest form of generalship is to balk the enemy�s plans; [Perhaps the word "balk" falls short of expressing the full force of the Chinese word, which implies not an attitude of defense, whereby one might be content to foil the enemy�s stratagems one after another, but an active policy of counter- attack. Ho Shih puts this very clearly in his note: "When the enemy has made a plan of attack against us, we must anticipate him by delivering our own attack first."] the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy�s forces; [Isolating him from his allies. We must not forget that Sun Tzu, in speak- ing of hostilities, always has in mind the numerous states or principalities into which the China of his day was split up.] 37 CHAPTER 4. ATTACK BY STRATAGEM 38 the next in order is to attack the enemy�s army in the field; [When he is already at full strength.] and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities. 1. The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be avoided. [Another sound piece of military theory. Had the Boers acted upon it in 1899, and refrained from dissipating their strength before Kimberley, Mafeking, or even Ladysmith, it is more than probable that they would have been masters of the situation before the British were ready seriously to oppose them.] The preparation of mantlets, movable shelters, and various implements of war, will
