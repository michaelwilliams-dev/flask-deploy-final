Making peoplewait isapowerful way offorcing time, aslongasthey donotfigureoutwhat youareupto.You control theclock, they linger in limbowand rapidlycome unglued, opening upopportunitiesforyouto strike. The oppositeeffect isequally powerful: You make your opponents hurry. Start offyour dealingswith them slowly,then suddenly apply pres- sure, making them feel thateverythingishappeningatonce. Peoplewho lack thetime tothink will make mistakes-—so settheir deadlines forthem. 298 LAW 3.1This was thetechniqueMachiavelli admired inCesare Borgia, who, during negotiations, would suddenly press vehementlyfor adecision, upsetting hisopponent’s timing and patience. For who would dare make Cesare wait? Joseph Duveen, thefamous artdealer, knew thatifhegaveanindeci- sivebuyerlikeJohnD.Rockefeller adeadline»-the paintinghad toleave thecountry, another tycoonwas interested init—the client would buyjust intime. Freud noticed thatpatientswho hadspent yearsinpsychoanalysis without improvement would miraculouslyrecover justintime ifhefixed a definite date fortheend ofthetherapy. Jacques Lacan, thefamous French psychoanalyst,used avariation onthis tactic—he would sometimes end thecustomary hour session oftherapy after onlytenminutes, without warning. After thishappenedseveral times, thepatientwould realize that hehad better make maximum useofthetime, rather than wasting much of thehour with alotoftalkthat meant nothing.The deadline, then, isapow- erful tool.

Magicians and showmen areexperts inforcing time.

Magicianshavealwaysknown that thebestwaytoalter ourpet- ception oftime isoften toslow down thepace. Creating suspense brings time toaterrifying pause:The slower themagician’s hands move, the eas- ieritistocreate theillusion ofspeed, making peoplethink therabbit has appeared instantaneously. The great nineteenthcentury magician _]ean—Eu— gene Robert~Houdin took explicitnotice ofthis effect: “The moreslowlya storyistold,” hesaid, “the shorter itseems.” Going slower also makes wha).youaredoingmore interesting»-the audience yieldstoyour pace,becomes entranced.
