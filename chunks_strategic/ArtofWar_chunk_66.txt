Compare Napoleon�s "Military Maxims," no. 1.] which enabled the Yellow Emperor to vanquish four several sovereigns. [Regarding the "Yellow Emperor": Mei Yao-ch�en asks, with some plaus- ibility, whether there is an error in the text as nothing is known of Huang Ti having conquered four other Emperors. The SHIH CHI (ch. 1 ad init.) speaks only of his victories over Yen Ti and Ch�ih Yu. In the LIU T�AO it is mentioned that he "fought seventy battles and pacified the Empire." Ts�ao Kung�s explanation is, that the Yellow Emperor was the first to in- stitute the feudal system of vassals princes, each of whom (to the number of four) originally bore the title of Emperor. Li Ch�uan tells us that the art of war originated under Huang Ti, who received it from his Minister Feng Hou.] 1. All armies prefer high ground to low. ["High Ground," says Mei Yao-ch�en, "is not only more agreement and salubrious, but more convenient from a military point of view; low ground is not only damp and unhealthy, but also disadvantageous for fighting."] and sunny places to dark. 1. If you are careful of your men, CHAPTER 10. THE ARMY ON THE MARCH 78 [Ts�ao Kung says: "Make for fresh water and pasture, where you can turn out your animals to graze."] and camp on hard ground, the army will be free from disease of every kind, [Chang Yu says: "The dryness of the climate will prevent the outbreak of illness."] and this will spell victory. 1. When you come to a hill or a bank, occupy the sunny side, with the slope on your right rear. Thus you will at once act for the benefit of your soldiers and utilize the natural advantages of the ground. 2. When, in consequence of heavy rains up-country, a river which you wish to ford is swollen and flecked with foam, you must wait until it subsides. 3. Country in which there are precipitous cliffs with torrents running between, deep natural hollows, [The latter defined as "places enclosed on every side by steep banks, with pools of water at the bottom.] confined places, [Defined as "natural pens or prisons" or "places surrounded by precipices on three sides�easy to get into, but hard to get out of."] tangled thickets, [Defined as "places covered with such dense undergrowth that spears can- not be used."] quagmires [Defined as "low-lying places, so heavy with mud as to be impassable for chariots and horsemen."] and crevasses, [Defined by Mei Yao-ch�en as "a narrow difficult way between beetling cliffs." Tu Mu�s note is "ground covered with trees and rocks, and inter- sected by numerous ravines and pitfalls." This is very vague, but Chia Lin explains it clearly enough as a defile or narrow pass, and Chang Yu takes much the same view. On the whole, the weight of the commentators cer- tainly inclines to the rendering "defile." But the ordinary
