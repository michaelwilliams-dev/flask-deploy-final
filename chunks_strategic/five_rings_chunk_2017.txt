heis interested only initsactualization. Hethusabandons thestandard which hesetinhis firstspeech about justice, that is,nature. What he wanted thenwasaproof that justice isgood according tonature and notmerely according toconvention orhuman agreement; justice wasto beshown toconduce tohuman happiness inthesamewayhealth does. This standard wasmaintained inthediscussion ofthedesirability of assigning thesamewayoflifetowomen astomen.Byshowing that women's natures arethesame asmen's andsupporting thisproof with examples ofnatural animal behavior, Glaucon and Socrates were satisfied thattheproposal waspossible andgood.NowGlaucon only wants toknow whether thecitycanexistwithout determining whether itisnatural andhence good. Attheend,heseems willing toaccept the cityand itsjustice without having found outthatthingwhich hehim- selfhadinsisted wasdecisive foraccepting orrejecting thecity.And it isclear thatthecommunity ofwomen andchildren, ifitwere toexist, would notbeaproduct ofnature butofart; itwould beatriumph of artover nature. Glaucon's desire toseehiscitycome intobeing has caused him toforget toaskwhether itisgood forman ornot.The lesson ofthischange inthemeaning ofpossibility would seem tobe that,though man existsbynature, thecitydoesnotand ishence ofa lower status thanman. Socrates, inapreamble tohisdiscussion ofthepossibility ofthe regime, contributes tothedepreciation ofthecitywhich wasjustbegun byabandoning thequestion ofitsnaturalness. Hemakes itclear that thisregime which istobebrought intobeing willnotbesimply just. Justice itself existsmore inspeech than deed. After allofthis effort, theproduct isadmitted tobeimperfect andnotlovable foritself but because itisanimitation ofjustice. Atthepeak oftheinsistence that everything begiven tothe city, itbecomes manifest thatnocity deserves such attention andthatonemust lookbeyond thecityforthe reality. This isagreat disappointment andprepares theway fora transcendence ofthecity. (473c~487a) Atlast,however, Socrates allows the finalwave— thephilosopher-kings— torollinonthem, andheintroduces hisown wayoflifeintothecity. Itisnowonder thathehesitated tospeak, for heasserts: [389 ] THEREPUBLIC Unless thephilosophers rule asIcings orthosenow called longsand chiefs genuinely andadequately philosophize, andpolitical power andphilosophy coincide inthesame place, while themany natures nowmaking theirway toeither apart from theother arebyneces- sityexcluded, there isnorestfrom illsforthe cities,mydear Glaucon, nor Ithink forhuman kind, norwilltheregime wehave nowdescribed inspeech evercome forth from nature, insofar as possible, andseethelight ofthesun. Socrates expects to^edrowned intides ofridicule forthisparadoxical assertion. Glaucon wholeheartedly agrees that thiswillbethecase,and anticipates thatthescorn willbemixed with anger. Thelaughter and indignation, which played soimportant arole inthediscussion ofthe firsttwowaves, reappear together here inamore intense form. Itis,however, hard formodem men tobeparticularly shocked by Socrates' pronouncement; itseemsmuch lesscomic orreprehensible to usthan theother waves. Itisnotthatwewould takethenotion very seriously, butweareinsome sense theheirsandbeneficiaries ofSoc- rates' work, even aswearethechildren oftheEnlightenment which radicalized thatwork. Partly because Socrates andPlato were soef- fective inarguing theusefulness ofphilosophy tocivil society, and partly because themeaning ofphilosophy haschanged, wenolonger believe thatthere isatension between philosophy and civil society. Al- though wemight doubt whether philosophers have thegiftofruling, we donotconsider theactivity ofphilosophy tobepernicious topolitical concerns. Hence thenotion ofphilosopher-kings isnot initself paradoxical forus.But, precisely because wetake itforgranted that thehatred ofphilosophy wasmerely prejudice, andthat history has helped ustoovercome thatprejudice, weareindanger ofmissing the pointwhich Socrates makes here. Inorder tounderstand thispassage, wemust seephilosophy against thenonphilosophic and hostile background fromwhich itemerged. Itisnotmerely historical curiosity which should lead ustomake this effort.Wemust rediscover the forgotten reasons forSocrates' difficulties inorder toevaluate therole ofphilosophy andscience within ourworld, fortheir rolemaybemore problematic thanwearewont tobelieve. Philosophy isarare plant, onewhich hasflourished only intheWest; itisperhaps theessence of thatWest. Itsplace isnotsimply assured everywhere andalways asis the city's.Thewritings ofPlato andafewothersmade itrespectable. TheRepublic thusrepresents oneofthemost decisive moments ofour history. Inthiswork Socrates presents thegrounds ofhisbeing brought totrialandshows whyphilosophy isalways indanger andalways in need ofadefense.
