aswell;andwhere coldness, something hot;andwhere the thirst ismuch onaccount ofthepresence of muchness, itwillcause thedesire tobeformuch, andwhere it's little, forlittle? But, thirsting itself willnever beadesire foranything other than that ofwhich itnaturally isadesire—fordrink alone—and, similarly, hungering willbeadesire forfood?" "That's theway itis,"hesaid."Each particular desire itself is only forthat particular thing itself ofwhich itnaturally is,while the desire forthisorthatkinddepends onadditions." 438a "Now letnoone catch usunprepared,"Isaid, "and cause a disturbance, alleging thatnoonedesires drink, butgood drink, nor [116] BookIV/4Jra-438d socrates/glauco food, butgood food; foreveryone, after all,desires good things; if, 438 then, thirst isadesire, itwould beforgood drink orforgoodwhatever itis,andsimilarly with theother desires." "Perhaps," hesaid, "themanwho says thatwould seem tomake some sense." "However," Isaid, "ofallthings thataresuch astoberelated to something, those thatareofacertain kind arerelated toathing ofa certain kind, asitseems tome,while those thatareseverally them- ; selves arerelated only toathing that isitself." "Idon't understand," hesaid. "Don't youunderstand," Isaid, "that thegreater issuch astobe greater thansomething?" "Certainly." "Than theless?" "Yes." "And themuch-greater than themuch-less, isn'tthatso?" "Yes." "And, then, also theonce-greater than theonce-less, and the- going-to-be-greater than the-going-to-be-less?" "Ofcourse," hesaid. "And, further, themore inrelation tothefewer, thedouble tothe c half,andeverything ofthesort;and, again, heavier tolighter, faster to slower; andfurther, thehottothecold,andeverything likethem— doesn't thesame thing hold?" "Most certainly." "Andwhat about thevarious sorts ofknowledge? Isn't itthesame way?Knowledge itself isknowledge oflearning itself, orofwhatever it istowhich knowledge should berelated; while aparticular kind of knowledge isofaparticular kind ofthing. Imean something like this. c When knowledge ofconstructing houses came tobe,didn't itdiffer from theother kinds ofknowledge andwasthus called housebuild- mg? "Ofcourse." "Wasn't thisbyitsbeing aparticular kind ofthing that isdifferent from theothers?" "Yes." "Since itwasrelated toaparticular kind ofthing, didn't ittoobe- come aparticular kind ofthing itself?And isn't thisthewaywith the other artsand sorts ofknowledge too?" ItIS. "Well, then," Isaid, "say thatwhat Iwanted tosaythen, ifyou nowunderstand after all, isthatofallthings that aresuch astobe [117 ] ;laucon/ SOCRATES THEREPUBLic 438d related tosomething, those that areonly themselves arerelatedto things thatareonlythemselves, while those thatarerelated tothings of aparticular kind areofaparticular kind.And Iinnosensemean that e they aresuch asthethings towhich theyhappen toberelated, sothat it would follow thattheknowledge ofthings healthy andsick ishealthy andsickandthatofbadandgood isitselfbadandgood. Butwhen knowledge became knowledge notofthatalone towhich knowledgeis related butofaparticular sortofthing, and thiswashealth and sickness, itasaconsequence alsobecame ofacertain sort itself; and thiscaused itnottobecalled knowledge simply anymore but,with the particular kindhaving beenadded toit,medicine." "Iunderstand," hesaid, "and, inmyopinion, that's theway itis." f39a "And then, asforthirst," Isaid, "won't youinclude itamong those things that arerelated tosomething? Surely thirst isinrela- tion to . .." "Iwill," hesaid,"and it'srelated todrink." "Soaparticular sortofthirst isJbr aparticular kind ofdrink, but thirst itself isneither formuch nor little,good norbad, nor,inaword, foranyparticular kind, but thirst itself isnaturally only fordrink." "That's entirely certain." "Therefore, thesoulofthemanwho's thirsty, insofar asitthirsts, b wishes nothing other than todrink, andstrives forthisand isimpelled toward it." "Plainly." "Ifeversomething draws itbackwhen it'sthirsting, wouldn't that besomething different initfrom thatwhich thirsts andleads itlikea beast todrink? Forofcourse, wesay,thesame thing wouldn't perform opposed actions concerning thesame thing with thesame partofitself atthesame time." "No, itwouldn't." "Just as,Isuppose, it'snotfairtosayofthearcher thathishands atthesame time thrust thebowaway anddraw itnear, butthatone hand pushes itaway andtheother pulls itin." c "That's entirely certain," hesaid. "Now, would weassert thatsorhetimes there aresomemenwho arethirsty butnotwilling todrink?" "Surely," hesaid,"many and often." "What should
