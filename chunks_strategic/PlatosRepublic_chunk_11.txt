to suggest that he would countenance the lies, for the most part ignoble, now ca11ed propaganda ... " (ibid., p. 106). But Socrates ca1ls it a lie. The difference between a parable and this ta1e is that the man who hears a parable is conscious that it is an in? vention the truth of which is not in its literal expression, whereas the inhabitants of Socrates' city are to be1ieve the untrue story to be true. His iQ._terlo to:rs are shocked by the notion, but-according to Corn? ford-we are to believe it is harmless because it might conjure up unpleasant associations. This whole question of lying has been carefu11y prepared by Plato from the very outset, starting with the discussion with old Cephalus (331 b--c). It recurs again with respect to the lies of the poets (377 d), and in the assertions that gods cannot lie (381� e--382 e) and that rulers may lie (380 b-c). Now, finally,fo is baldly stated that the only truly just civil society must be founded on a lie. Socrates prefers to face up to the issue with- clarity. A good regime cannot be based on enlighten? ment; if there is no lie, a number of compromises-among them priv te property-must be made and hence merely conventional inequalities must be accepted. This is a radical statement about the relationship between truth and justice, one which leads to the parado}!: that wisdom can rule only in an element dominated by falsehood It is hardly w<?rth obscuring this issue for the sake of avoiding the crudest of misun? derstandings. And perhaps the peculiarly modem phenomenon of prop? aganda might become clearer to the man who sees that it is somehow related to a certain myth of enlightenment which is itself brought into question by the Platonic analysis.\ Beyond the general problems affecting the translation of all Greek and Latin texts, the Platonic dialogues present a particular difficulty. It is not too hard to find acceptable versions of Aristotle's _treatises. This is because they are not entirely unlike modem books. There is, on the other hand, frequently a lack of clarity about the purposes of the dialogue form. Plato is commonly understood to have had a teaching like that of Aristotle and to have enclosed it in a sweet co�ating designed to perform certain didactic or artistic functions but which must be stripped away to get to the philo ophic core. We then have Plato the poet and Plato the philosopher, two beings rolled into one and coexist? ing in an uneasy harmony. This is the fatal error which leads to the distinction between. form and substance. The student of philosophy then takes one part of the dialogue as his special.domain and t_he stu? dent of literature another as his; the translator' follows suit, using great license in the bulk of the book and reverting to a care appr(?priate to Aristotle when philosophy appears to enter. Cornford, as in all other things, expresses the curren te1:3dency in a
