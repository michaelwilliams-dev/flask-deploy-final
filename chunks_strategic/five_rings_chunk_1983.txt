aproper reaction tolawbreaker^ whoarethought to harm other sfortheir selfish end s.ButThrasymachus hasstripped away die^veils thatcovered theselfishness oftherulers andtheir laws.Those lawsthemselves serve theprivate interest ofapartofthecityanddo harm totherestofit.Laws arenotdirected tothecommon good.And yetthecitywillcontinue toputlawbreakers todeath asunjustmenand enemies ofthecommon good.Theangerawakened inmenbythesight ofindifference orhostility tolaw isapowerful force inprotecting the lawandhence thecity,but itcanalsobetheenemy ofjustice and is certainly thegreatest enemy ofphilosophy. Thrasymachus, whose art gives speech tothepassions ofthecity, isitsagent incondemning Soc- rates,andhisaction intheservice ofthispassion imitates thecity's ac- tion. Theimmediate cause ofThrasymachus' ireistheendofSocrates' argument withPolemarchus. Based onthetacitpremise thatjustice is good, theargument ledtotheconclusion thatjustice isanai:tthatdoes good tothose towhom itministers. The justman profits both others andhimself. Thismeans thatthere isacommon good; thecommunity isbound together byjustice, andnoonesacrifices hisownpersonal ad- vantage to it.Onthecontrary,, if—touseSocrates' hyperbolic ex- pression—justice ishuman virtue, each gains hisfulfillment inthe prosperity ofthewhole.Ajustmannever harms anyone. Thrasyma- chus, referring tohisknowledge oftheworld andtheactual practice of thecities, treats thisview astheresult ofaculpable innocence, anin- nocence destructive tothehappiness ofthosewho aretaken inby it. Practically speaking, asCephalus' example shows, justice islaw-abid- ingness. That iscertainly what thecitysays itis;and,even ifthere isanatural justice, itmustbeembodied inacode ofpolitical lawinor- dertohave areal effect. The cityalways presents itslaws asacon- stitutive partofitself, liketheterritory andthepopulace. But, infact, those lawscanvary astheterritory andthepopulace cannot; theyarea function oftheregime, ofthekind ofmenwhogovern thecity.When thepoor, ortherich, ortheoldfamilies, oratyrant takeovertherule inacity, itslawschange correspondingly. Thesovereign makes the [327 ] THErepublic! laws,andthose lawsalways happen toreflect itsinterests.Oligarchies make lawswhich favor andprotect oligarchy; democracy makes laws which favor andprotect democracy, etc.Theregime istheabsolute beginning point; there isnothing beyond it.Tounderstand thekind of justice practiced inanycityonemust look totheregime. Thelawshave their source inthehuman, alltoohuman. Hewhoobeys them in reverence orinfear, issimply serving theadvantage ofthestronger whether thestronger isasingle man, orthegreat majority ofthepeo- ple,oranyother politically relevant group within thecity. Ifthisbethe case,however, prudence and self-interest would seem todictate tothe individual thateither heshould trytoevade thelaworelsebecome the lawmaker himself Thrasymachus' thesis issimply that theregime makes thelawsandthatthemembers oftheregime look totheirown goodandnotthecommon good.The city isnotaunity butacomposite ofopposed parties, andtheparty which wins outovertheothers isthe source ofthelaw.There isnofundamental difference between tyranny andother regimes because they allhave thesame selfish end. Justice, therefore, isnotafundamental phenomenon; thelawgiver cannot base himself upon it,forjustice isaresult oflaw. Socrates does notdeny that itisthestronger who ruleand establish thelaw.Hesilently accepts theview that allexisting regimes areasThrasymachus saysthey are.Thetwomenthusagree thatthe character oftheruling group isthecoreofpolitics, thattherulers are thestronger, andthat justice isapolitical phenomenon andmust be embodied inthelaws ofacity.The issuebetween them iswhether all rulers, alllawgivers, mustbeselfish inthewayThrasymachus insists they are.From thispoint onthequestion istheregime—who rules; and Socrates tries tofind akind ofman, apolitical class, which isboth strong andpublic-spirited. Socrates turns, then, tothecriticism ofThrasymachus' view ofthe rulers.Hequickly succeeds inembarrassing himbythereflection that sometimes rulersmake mistakes; hence obedience tothelawmaybeas much totheir disadvantage astheir advantage. Justice isnotthead- vantage ofthestronger unless thestronger (therulers) knowwhat their own advantage is.The emphasis now shifts from jtrene; th__to knowledge. Socrates' question appears torefer torulers' mistakes about themeans totheir ends, butcould apply tomistakes about theproper ends ofaction. Socrates, then, isalsoasking whether therulers really knowwhat isadvantageous andleads Thrasymachus intoaregion of profound problems onwhich hehashardly reflected. Like Polemar- chus, hetakes itforgranted that themostcommon objects of desire— particularly whatever hastodowealth—areadvantageous and thatknowledge ofthem isagiven.
