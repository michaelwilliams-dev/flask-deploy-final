Having narrated theactions oftheDuke Iwould notknow wherein toreprove him— infact, heseems tometobeworthy of imitation toallwho would risetorulebyfortune andthearms of others. Having agrand spirit andlofty aims, hecould notgovern otherwise. Hisonly obstacles were Alexander's death andhisown sickness. Whoever finds itneedful inanewPrincipality tosecure himself against enemies, gain friends, towinbyforce ordeceit, beloved andfeared bythepopulace, follow anduphold hissol- diers, terminate those who could hurthim, innovate neworders in place ofoldcustoms, bestrict ,grateful, magnanimous andlib- eral, cutdown unloyal militia, create anew army, keep the friendship ofPrinces andKings insuch awaythatthey help one 56— Niccolò Machiavelli orrespect one, onecould notfindabetter example than thatof theDuke. Only intheelection ofPope Julius IIcould onecriticize him, where hehadbadluck. Notbeing able tomake hisown man he could atleast have prevented thewrong man from being elected. Heshould never have consented totheelection ofaPope by those Cardinals whom hehadoffended, andwho hadreason to fearhim. Men doharm outoffearorhate. Those whom hehad offended were among others Giuliano della Rovere, Giovanni Colonna, Cardinal Raffaele Riarlo, andCardinal Ascanio Sforza. Alltheothers ifthey hadbeen elected Pope would have feared himexcept theCardinal ofRouen andtheSpaniards; theSpan- iards would have remained onhissidebecause theywere related, while theCardinal ofRouen would have been sympathetic be- cause hewasconnected with theKingdom ofFrance. Therefore, theDuke should have firstofallcreated aSpanish Pope. Short of that, heshould have gone with theCardinal ofRouen andnot Rovere. Whoever believes thatingreat personages newbenefices make them forget oldinjuries isdeceived. TheDuke made amis- take inthiselection anditledtohisruin. OFTHOSE WHO COME TOPOWER TTHROUGH VILLAINY herecitizenryLetusarenottwowhereinneglectways neithertotheserisecases,tofortuneaPrincedomalthoughnorvirtuefromoneplaysofthethemprivate apart. — thecivic Prince —belongs more toadiscussion ofRepublics. I refer here tocases where aman rises toPrincedom bynefarious orvillainous means, orinthecase ofthecivic Prince, treated in thenext chapter, when acitizen rises topower with thehelp of hisfellow citizenry. Butspeaking ofthose who risebynefarious orvillainous means, Iwillshow twoexamples, oneancient, one modern, without arguing themerits ofthecases, because incases ofnecessity, Ijudge itsimply expedient toimitate them. TheSicilian Agatocle (Tyrant ofSyracuse, 317-289 B.C.) not only rose from thecitizenry butfrom infamous andabject fortune tobecome King ofSyracuse. Born ofapotter, helived abadlife. Notwithstanding, helived hiswicked ways with such vigor and fitness that, after joining themilitia, herose toCommander in Chief. Having reached thisposition, andhaving decided tobe- come Prince byviolence andwithout obligation toothers who would block him, andkeeping inmind thepresence oftheCar- thaginian Hamilcar —whose army wasinSicily —heconvened thepeople andsenators onemorning ofSyracuse asifhewanted toconsult them about affairs ofstate. Atthesign, hisarmy killed thesenators andtherichest citizens, clearing hiswaytotake the Principality without civil opposition. Although hewastwice de- feated bytheCarthaginians andcitywasassaulted, notonly did hesucceed indefending thecitybut,leaving partofhisarmy to hold thefort, with therestheattacked Hamilcar andinashort time notonly liberated Syracuse butchased theAfricans outand 60— Niccolò Machiavelli they hadtorestcontent with African bases andleave Syracuse to Agatocle. Whoever considers thislife,andAgatocle's actions, willnot find much lefttofortune; notbyanyone's favor was Agatocle helped, butbymilitary intervention beset bymany inconven- iences anddangers. This was brought himtopower andmain- tained hisPrincipality. Nor canonesayitwas virtue
