them," I said. "For those I mean are also the ones having names; the one that is praised by the many, that Cretan and Laconian regime; and second in place and second in praise, the one called oligarchy, a regime filled with throngs of evils; and this regime's adversary, arising next in order, democracy; and then the noble tyranny at last, excelling all of these, the fourth and extreme illness of a city. Or have you some other idea of a regime that fits into some distinct form? For dynasties and purchased kingships and certain regimes of the sort are somewhere between these, and one would find them no less among the barbarians than the Greeks."1 "At any rate," he said, "many strange ones are talked about." "Do you know," I said, "that it is necessary that there also be as many forms of human characters as there are forms of regimes? Or do you suppose that the regimes arise 'from an oak or rocks'2 and not from the dispositions of the men in the cities, which, tipping the scale as it were, draw the rest along with them?" "No," he said. "I don't at all think they arise from anything other than this." "Therefore if there are five arrangements of cities, there would al? so be five for the soul of private men." "Surely." r 222 J "Well, we have already described the man who is Jike the aristocracy, a man of whom we rightly assert that he is both good and � just." "Yes, we have described him." "Must we next go through the worse men-the man who loves victory and honor, fixed in relation to the Laconian regime; and then, in tum, an oligarchic and a democratic man, and the tyrannic man, so that seeing the most unjust man, we can set him in opposition to the most just man? If so, we can have a complete consideration of how pure justice�is related to pure injustice with respect to the happiness and wretchedness of the men possessing them. In this way we may be persuaded either by Thrasymachus and pursue injustice, or by the argument that is now coming to light and pursue justice." "That," he said, "is most certainly what must be done." "Then, just as we began by considering the various dispositions in the regimes before considering them in the private men, supposing that to be the more luminous way; so must we now consider first the regime that loves honor-I can give no other name that is used for it in com? mon parlance; it should be called either timocracy or timarchy.3 And, in relation to this regime, we shall consider the like man, and after that oligarchy and an oligarchic man. Later, after having looked at democracy, we'll view a democratic man; and fourth, having gone to the city that is under a tyranny and seen it, then looking into a tyran? nic soul, we shall try to become adequate judges of the
