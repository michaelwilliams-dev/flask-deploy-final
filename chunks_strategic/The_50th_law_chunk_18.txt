Consider it war. You must fight this tendency as best you can and move in the opposite direction. You must turn outward and become a keen observer of all that is around you. You are doing battle against all the fantasies that are thrown at you. You are tightening your connection to the environment. You want clarity, not escape and confusion. Moving in this direction will instantly bring you power among so many dreamers. Regard the following as exercises for your mind�to make it less rigid, more penetrating and expansive, a sharper gauge of reality. Practice all of them as often as you can. REDISCOVER CURIOSITY�OPENNESS One day it came to the attention of the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates that the oracle at Delphi had pronounced him the wisest man in the world. This baffled the philosopher�he did not think himself worthy of such a decree. It made him uncomfortable.

What you need to do in life is return to that mind you possessed as a child, opening up to experience instead of closing it off. Just imagine for a day that you do not know anything, that what you believe could be completely false. Let go of your preconceptions and even your most cherished beliefs. Experiment.

See everything as a source for education� even the most banal encounters. Imagine that the world is still full of mystery. When you operate this way, you will notice that something strange
