to take a hard it line than to let compassion and softness lead to disorder and riots. to These are counter the public good. Disciplinary action only hurts a few � the offenders. Among Princes, it is hardest for the new Prince to avoid charges of cruelty, because new states are full of threats. Virgil put these words into the mouth of Dido: Hard political necessity and the newness of the realm force me to take tough measures and deploy troops to protect my realm. (Aeneid, I, 563-564) At the same time, the Prince should be deliberate in believing what he hears and in acting nor just create fear for the sake of He fear. should proceed with prudence and with humanity. Overconfidence should not supersede caution and carelessness would only lead to making the Prince unpopular. From this arises the question: should a Prince better be feared, or loved? The answer is: he should be both, but because it is hard 94� Niccol� Machiavelli to be both at the same time, it is much safer to be feared than loved, if one must renounce to one or the other.

When you favor them they are all on your side offering their blood, goods, life, and sons, when there is no real need.

Love creates a bond that sadly obligates men only as long as it serves their own purpose, but fear is hardened by the sureness of punishment and never lets you down. Nevertheless, the Prince must make himself feared in such a way that, short of being loved, he is at least not hated. These two conditions can be very well linked together. This will happen eas.ily as long as you lay off the goods and women of your citizens and subjects. If you have to take someone's life do it when there is easy justification and apparent cause. Above all, don't touch people's possessions. Men forget the death of a father sooner than the loss of his estate. Reasons for taking people's property always exist, and once started down this path, there is no stopping, but reasons for killing someone are more rare, and it is easier to lie off.
