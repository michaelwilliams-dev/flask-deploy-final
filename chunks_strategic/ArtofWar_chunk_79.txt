neck of a pass," instanced by Li Ch�uan. Thus, Thermopylae was of this classification because the possession of it, even for a few days only, meant holding the entire invading army in check and thus gaining invaluable time. Cf. Wu Tzu, ch. V. ad init.: "For those who have to fight in the ratio of one to ten, there is nothing better than a narrow pass." When Lu Kuang was returning from his triumphant expedition to Turkestan in 385 A.D., and had got as far as I-ho, laden with spoils, Li- ang Hsi, administrator of Liang-chou, taking advantage of the death of Fu Chien, King of Ch�in, plotted against him and was for barring his way into the province. Yang Han, governor of Kao-ch�ang, counseled him, saying: "Lu Kuang is fresh from his victories in the west, and his soldiers are vig- orous and mettlesome. If we oppose him in the shifting sands of the desert, we shall be no match for him, and we must therefore try a different plan. Let us hasten to occupy the defile at the mouth of the Kao-wu pass, thus cutting him off from supplies of water, and when his troops are prostrated with thirst, we can dictate our own terms without moving. Or if you think that the pass I mention is too far off, we could make a stand against him at the I-wu pass, which is nearer. The cunning and resource of Tzu-fang himself would be expended in vain against the enormous strength of these two positions." Liang Hsi, refusing to act on this advice, was overwhelmed and swept away by the invader.] 1. Ground on which each side has liberty of movement is open ground. [There are various interpretations of the Chinese adjective for this type of ground. Ts�ao Kung says it means "ground covered with a network of roads," like a chessboard. Ho Shih suggested: "ground on which inter- communication is easy."] 1. Ground which forms the key to three contiguous states, [Ts�au Kung defines this as: "Our country adjoining the enemy�s and a third country conterminous with both." Meng Shih instances the small principality of Cheng, which was bounded on the north-east by Ch�i, on the west by Chin, and on the south by Ch�u.] so that he who occupies it first has most of the Empire at his command, [The belligerent who holds this dominating position can constrain most of them to become his allies.] is a ground of intersecting highways. CHAPTER 12. THE NINE SITUATIONS 95 1. When an army has penetrated into the heart of a hostile country, leaving a number of fortified cities in its rear, it is serious ground. [Wang Hsi explains the name by saying that "when an army has reached such a point, its situation is serious."] 1. Mountain forests, [Or simply "forests."] rugged steeps, marshes and fens�all country that is hard to traverse: this is difficult ground. 1. Ground which is reached through narrow gorges, and from which we can
