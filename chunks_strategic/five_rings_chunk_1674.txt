famous seventeenth-century Ming painterChou Yung relates astorythat altered hisbehavior forever. Late one winter afternoon hesetout to visit atown thatlayacross theriver from his own town. He wasbringingsome importantbooks and papers with him and had commis- sioned ayoung boytohelphimcarry them. Astheferry neared theother side oftheriver, Chou Yungasked theboatman ifthey would have time to gettothetown before itsgates closed, since itwas amileawayandnight wasapproaching.The boatman glancedattheboy,and atthebundle of looselytiedpapersandbooks-“Yes,” hereplied,“ifyou donotwalk too fast.” Asthey started out, however, the sun was setting. Afraid ofbeing locked outofthetown atnight, preytolocal bandits, Chou and theboy walked faster and faster, finally breakinginto arun.Suddenlythestring around thepapersbroke and thedocuments scattered ontheground. It took themmanyminutes toputthepacket together again,andbythetime theyhad reached thecitygates,itwas toolate. Whenyouforce thepaceoutoffear andimpatience, youcreate anest ofproblemsthatrequire fixing,andyouenduptaking much longer than if youhad takenyourtime. Hurriersmay occasionally getthere quicker,but papers flyeverywhere,new dangers arise, andtheyfind themselves incon- stant crisis mode, fixingtheproblemsthattheythemselves have created. Sometimes notactinginthe face ofdanger isyourbestmove»-you wait, youdeliberately slow down. Astimepassesitwilleventually present op portunities youhad notimagined. Waitinginvolves controllingnotonly yourown emotions butthose of your colleagues, who, mistakingacfion forpower, may trytopush youinto makingrash moves. Inyour rivals, ontheother hand, youcan encourage this same mistake: Ifyouletthem rush headlonginto trouble whileyou stand back andwait, youwill soon findripemoments tointervene andpick upthepieces.This wisepolicywas theprincipal strategyofthegreat early- seventeenthcentury emperor Tokugawa Ieyasuofjapan.

The trick inforcing time istoupsetthetiming ofothers-——t0 make them hurry, tomake them wait, tomake them abandon their own pace,todistort their perception oftime. Byupsetting thetiming ofyour op~ ponentwhileyoustaypatient, you open uptime foryourself, which ishalf thegame. In1473 thegreatTurkish sultan Mehmed theConquerorinvited nego- tiations with Hungarytoend theelf-andam war the two countries had waged foryears.When theHungarian emissaryarrived inTurkeytostart thetalks, Turkish officials humbly apologized——Mehmed hadjustleftIstan- bul, thecapital,tobattle hislongtime foe, Uzun Hasan. But heurgently wantedpeacewith Hungary,and had asked that theemissary join him at thefront. When theemissary anived atthe siteofthefighting,Mehmed had al- readyleftit,movingeastward inpursuit ofhisswift foe. Thishappened several times. Wherever theemissary stopped,theThrks lavished gifts and banquetsonhim, inpleasurablebuttimeconsuming ceremonies. Finally Mehrned defeated Uzun and met with theemissary. Yethisterms forpeace with Hungarywere excessivelyharsh. After afewdays,thenegotiations ended, and theusual stalemate remained inplace. But this was fine with Mehmecl. Infact hehadplanneditthatwayallalong: Plotting his cam-
