Brecht, ontheother hand, expressed hisdisgustatthe committee more indirectly.Itwas notthat hechanged hisbeliefs orcompromisedhis values; instead, during hisshort testimony,hekepttheupperhand byap- pearingtoyieldwhile allthetime running circles around thecommittee withvague responses, outrightlies that went unchallenged because they were wrapped inenigmas,and wordgames.Intheend hekept thefree- dom tocontinue hisrevolutionary writing (asopposedtosuffering impris onment ordetainment intheUnited States), even while subtly mockingthe committee and itsauthoritywith hispseudo-obedience.

Ethiopian prozuzllr KEYS T0POWER What getsusinto trouble intherealm ofpowerisoften our own overreac~ tion tothe moves ofour enemies and rivals. That overreaction creates problemswewould have avoided had webeen more reasonable. Italso has anendless rebound effect, fortheenemythen overreacts aswell, much astheAthenians did totheMelians. Itisalwaysourfirst instinct toreact, to meet aggression with some other kind ofaggression.But the next time someonepushes youandyoufindyourself starting toreact, trythis: Donot resist orfight back, butyield,turn theother cheek, bend. Youwillfind that thisoften neutralizes their behavior——they expected,even wanted youto react with force and sotheyarecaught ofiguardand confounded byyour lackofresistance. Byyielding, youinfact control thesituation, because yoursurrender ispart ofalarger plantolullthem intobelieving theyhave defeated you. This isthe essence ofthesurrender tactic: Inwardly youstayfirm, but outwardly you bend. Deprived ofareason togetangry, your opponents willoften bebewildered instead.
