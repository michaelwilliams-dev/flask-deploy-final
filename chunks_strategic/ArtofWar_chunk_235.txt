when they see the beginning; thus there is no way for disaster to happen. This is due to thoughtful consideration. Strength in Generals Generals have five strengths and eight evils. The five strengths are: noble behavior that can inspire the common people, social virtues that can elevate their reputations, trustworthiness and dutifulness in personal relationships, universal love encompassing all the people, and powerful action to succeed in their tasks. The eight evils are: inability to assess right and wrong when formulating strategy, inability to delegate authority to the wise and the good in times of order, inability to mete out just punishments for incidents of disorder, inability to help the poor in times of plenty, insufficient intelligence to guard against threats before they have taken shape, insufficient thought to prevent subtle dangers, inability to express what is known intuitively, and inability to avoid criticism in defeat. Sending Out the Armed Forces In ancient times, when a nation was in trouble, the ruler would select a wise man and have him fast for three days in quiet seclusion before going to the gate of the national shrine, where he would stand facing south. He then took a high courtier to present a ceremonial axe to the ruler, who in turn would pass it by the handle to the general, saying: �The military leadership settles matters outside the borders,� and also directing him in these terms: �Where you see the enemy to be empty, proceed; where you see the enemy to be full, stop. �Do not look down on others because of your own elevated rank. �Do not oppose the common consensus with personal opinions. �Do not turn from the loyal and trustworthy through the artifices of the skilled but treacherous. �Do not sit down before the soldiers sit; do not eat before the soldiers eat. �Bear the same cold and heat the soldiers do; share their toil as well as their ease. �Experience sweetness and bitterness just as the soldiers do; take the same risks that they do. �Then the soldiers will exert themselves to the utmost, and it will be possible to destroy enemies.� Having accepted these words, the general led the armed forces out through the city�s gate of ill omen. The ruler, seeing the general off, knelt and said, �Advance and retreat are a matter of timing�military affairs are not directed by the ruler but by the general. Therefore �There is no heaven above, no earth below, no adversary ahead, and no ruler behind.� Thus the intelligent think because of this; the mettlesome fight because of this.� Selection on Abilities In military action, there are men who like to fight and enjoy battle, singlehandedly taking on powerful opponents; gather them into one squad and call them �the warriors who repay the nation.� There are mettlesome men with ability and strength, courage and speed; gather them into a squad and call them �the warriors who crash the battle lines.� There are those who are light of foot, good walkers
