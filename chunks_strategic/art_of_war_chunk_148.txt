CAO Armaments are taken from the homeland, provisions are taken from the enemy. Master Sun When a country is impoverished by military operations, it is because of transporting supplies to a distant place. Transport supplies to a distant place, and the populace will be impoverished. LI QUAN Troops are raised repeatedly, and the levies are heavy. DU MU Master Guan said, �When provisions go for three hundred miles, the country is out a year�s supplies; when provisions go for four hundred miles, the country is out two years� supplies; when provisions go for five hundred miles, the people pale with hunger.� This means that food should not be transported, for if it is, the producers will lose, so they cannot but be impoverished. JIA LIN Transporting supplies to distant places means that wealth is expended in travel and used up on transportation, so that the common people become poorer day by day. ZHANG YU When seven hundred thousand families have to support an army of one hundred thousand on a distant expedition, the common peoples cannot avoid impoverishment. Master Sun Those who are near the army sell at high prices. Because of high prices, the wealth of the common people is exhausted.

Therefore long military campaigns are a plague to a nation. Master Sun When resources are exhausted, then levies are made under pressure. When power and resources are exhausted, then the homeland is drained. The common people are deprived of seventy percent of their budget, while the government�s expenses for equipment amount to sixty percent of its budget. DU MU If the military situation is not resolved and the army is not demobilized, levies become increasingly oppressive, resulting in exhaustion of the resources of the people, so that they lose most of what they produce. HO YANXI The people are the basis of a country, food is the heaven of the people. Those who rule over others should respect this and be sparing. MEI YAOCHEN The common people provide goods, food, and labor for the use of the military, thus losing most of
