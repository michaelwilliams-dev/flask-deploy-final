The next day (heguests assemhled, and were 368 LAW 43TRANSGRESSION OFTHE LAW Near theendofthereign ofLouis XV, allofFrance seemed desperatefor change. When theking’s grandson and chosen successor, thefuture Louis XVI, married thefifteen-year-old daughteroftheempress ofAustria, the French caughtaglimpseofthefuture that seemed hopeful.Theyoung bride, Ma.rie~Antoinette, was beautiful and full oflife. She instantly changedthemood ofthe court, which was rank with Louis XV’s dc» baucheries; even the common people,who hadyettoseeher, talked excit- edly ofMarie-Antoinette. The French hadgrown disgustedwith the series ofmistresses who had dominated Louis XV, andthey looked forward to sewing their newqueen.In1773, when Marie-Antoinette publiclyrode through the streets ofParis forthefirst time, applaudingcrowds swarmed around hercarriage. “How fortunate,” she wrote hermother, “tobeina positioninwhich one cangainwidespread affection atsolittle cost.” In1774 Louis XV died and Louis XVI took thethrone. As soon as Maxie-Antninette becamequeenshe abandoned herself tothepleasures sheloved themost—-ordering andwearing themost expensive gowns and jewelry intherealm; sportingthe most elaborate hair inhistory,her sculptedcoiffures risingasmuch asthree feet above herhead; andthrowing aconstant succession ofmasked balls and fétes. Allofthese whims shepaid foroncredit, never concerningherself with thecost orwhopaidthebills. Marie~Antoinette’s greatest pleasurewas thecreation anddesigningof aprivateGarden ofEden atthePetit Trianon, achéteau onthegroundsof Versailles with itsown woods. ThegardensatthePetit Trianon were tobe as“natural” aspossible, includingmoss applied byhand tothe trees and rocks. Toheightenthepastoral effect, thequeen employed peasantmilk- maids tomilk thefinestlookingcows intherealm; launderers and cheese makers inspecial peasantoutfits shehelped design; shepherdstotend sheepwith silkribbons around their necks. \'Vhen sheinspectedthebams, shewould watch hermilkmaids squeezing milk intoporcelainvases made attheroyalceramic works. Topassthetime, Ma.rie«Antoinette would gather flowers inthewoods around thePetit Trianon, orwatch her“good peasants” doingtheir “chores.” The place became aseparate world, its community limited toherchosen favofites. With each newwhim, the cost ofmaintainingthePetit Trianon soared. Meanwhile. France itself wasdeteriorating: There was famine and wide spread discontent. Even sociallyinsulated courtiers seethed with resent- ment-—thequeentreated them like children. Only herfavorites mattered, and these were becoming fewer and fewer. But Marie~Antoinette did not concern herself with this. Not once throughout herreigndid she read a minister’s report.Not once didshe tour theprovinces andrallythepeople toherside. Not once didshemingle amongtheParisians, orreceive adc} egation from them. She did none ofthese thingsbecause asqueenshefelt thepeopleowed hertheir affection, and she was notrequiredtolove them inreturn. In1784 thequeenbecame embroiled inascandal. Aspart ofanelabo- rate swindle, the most expensivediamond necklace inEuropehad been purchasedunder her name, and duringthe swindlers‘ trial her lavish lifestylebecame public: People heard about themoneyshespentonjewels and dresses and masked dances.
