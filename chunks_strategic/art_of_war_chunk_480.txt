steps and held a dagger against his chest. None of the duke�s retainers dared to move a muscle, and Ts�ao Kuei proceeded to demand full restitution, declaring the Lu was being un- justly treated because she was a smaller and a weaker state. Huan Kung, in peril of his life, was obliged to consent, whereupon Ts�ao Kuei flung away his dagger and quietly resumed his place amid the terrified assemblage without having so much as changed color. As was to be expected, the Duke wanted afterwards to repudiate the bargain, but his wise old coun- selor Kuan Chung pointed out to him the impolicy of breaking his word, and the upshot was that this bold stroke regained for Lu the whole of what she had lost in three pitched battles.] 29. The skillful tactician may be likened to the SHUAI-JAN. Now the SHUAI- JAN is a snake that is found in the Ch�ang mountains. 1Giles� Biographical Dictionary, no. 399. CHAPTER 12. THE NINE SITUATIONS 102 ["Shuai-jan" means "suddenly" or "rapidly," and the snake in question was doubtless so called owing to the rapidity of its movements. Through this passage, the term in the Chinese has now come to be used in the sense of "military maneuvers."] Strike at its head, and you will be attacked by its tail; strike at its tail, and you will be attacked by its head; strike at its middle, and you will be attacked by head and tail both. 30. Asked if an army can be made to imitate the SHUAI-JAN, [That is, as Mei Yao-ch�en says, "Is it possible to make the front and rear of an army each swiftly responsive to attack on the other, just as though they were part of a single living body?"] I should answer, Yes. For the men of Wu and the men of Yueh are enemies; [Cf. VI. ss. 21.] yet if they are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a storm, they will come to each other�s assistance just as the left hand helps the right. [The meaning is: If two enemies will help each other in a time of common peril, how much more should two parts of the same army, bound together as they are by every tie of interest and fellow-feeling. Yet it is notori- ous that many a campaign has been ruined through lack of cooperation, especially in the case of allied armies.] 31. Hence it is not enough to put one�s trust in the tethering of horses, and the burying of chariot wheels in the ground [These quaint devices to prevent one�s army from running away recall the Athenian hero Sophanes, who carried the anchor with him at the battle of Plataea, by means of which he fastened himself firmly to one spot. [See Herodotus, IX. 74.] It is not enough, says Sun Tzu, to render flight im- possible by such mechanical means. You will not succeed unless your men have tenacity and unity of purpose,
