principles of the I Ching throughout Chinese chivalric lore in the middle ages. Cheng Yi also takes a characteristically moral view of the I Ching�s statement, �The army is to go forth in an orderly manner; otherwise doing well turns out badly.� To the idealist Cheng, this reaffirms the importance of ethical human values in conflict. He says, �An �orderly manner� means a combination of justice and reason. This means that the mission of the army is to stop disorder and get rid of violence. If the army acts unjustly, then even if it does well the affair turns out badly. In this sense, �doing well� means winning victories; �turning out badly� means killing people unjustly.� The second element of �The Army� hexagram represents the military leadership. It is placed in a subordinate position with respect to the civil leadership, representing the principle that the military exists to serve the nation and people, not the other way around. Cheng Yi says, �That means the leader of the army should be the leader only in the army.� Zhuge Liang, who was both a civil and military director, also said, �Culture takes precedence over the martial.� The I Ching�s statement on the second element reads, �In the army, balanced, one is fortunate and blameless,� meaning, �the leadership of a militia is lucky and blameless if it is balanced.� Cheng Yi says, �Those who assume sole charge (of a militia) yet who manage to steer a balanced middle course are fortunate because of this, and are blameless.� In respect to the nature of military authority in the total context of society as symbolized by this hexagram, Cheng Yi defines one meaning of balance in these terms: �The point seems to be that if one presumes upon authority one strays from the right path of subordination; yet if one does not exercise authority there is no way to accomplish anything. Therefore it is best to find a balanced middle way.� In abstract terms, a general stands for someone who has been entrusted with the responsibility for a task and, while exercising leadership and organizational skills to carry it through, does so with the awareness that field command, while completely in the hands of the general, is based on delegated authority. Although the qualities of leadership are essential in the leader of a delegation, it is the purpose and not the person that is of paramount importance in the whole event. The statement of the I Ching on this element also says, �The king thrice bestows a mandate.� This restates the constitutional imperative of I Ching culture, that the authorization for militia and military action comes from civil government. It is also taken to mean that if a militia or other special task force does its job well, then it is deemed trustworthy and therefore gives peace of mind to the populace. The practice of employing standing armies for public works projects originally grew out of this principle. When this practice was employed in China,
