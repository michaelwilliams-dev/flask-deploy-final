This intelligence is cultivated bydeeply immersing ourselves in a field of study and staying true to our inclinations, no matter how unconventional our approach might seem toothers. This power is what our brains were designed to attain, and wewill be naturally led to this type of intelligence if we follow ourinclinations to their ultimate ends.THE THIRD TRANSFORMATIONMarcel ProustKEYS TO MASTERYExamples of Masters seeing more—the fingertip feel—a power that ismystified—high-level intuition—the Dynamic—gaining an intuitive feelfor the whole—Jane Goodall’s feel for chimpanzees—Erwin Rommel’sfeel for battle—the fusing of the rational and the intuitive—mastery at20,000 hours—time as a crucial factor—make study time qualitativelyrich—interpretation of Proust storyThe Roots of Masterly IntuitionThe Ammophila wasp—intuition and our primitive ancestors—mnemonic networks in the brain—Bobby Fischer and memory traces—engaging with complexity—gaining a tolerance for chaos—increasing memory capacity—examples of high-level intuition andyouthfulnessThe Return to RealityOverview of evolution from the beginning—the interconnectedness ofall life—the ultimate reality—our modern Renaissance—returning tothe whole—the altered brain of the MasterSTRATEGIES FOR ATTAINING MASTERY1.

But it’s the same with that type of artistic activity as with all others: We aremerely born with the capability to do it. The skill to mold the material into what we wantmust be learned and attentively cultivated.—JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHEThere exists a form of power and intelligence that represents the high pointof human potential.
