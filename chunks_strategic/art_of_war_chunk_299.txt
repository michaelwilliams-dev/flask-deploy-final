strike a force ten times my size?� Master Sun replied, �Yes. Attack where they are unprepared, act when they least expect it.� This tactic is taken directly from The Art of War by Sun Wu (Sun Tzu). The idea is that greater power and resources do not guarantee tactical superiority if they are not effectively employed. The purpose of deception as a strategic art, therefore, is to prevent adversaries from using their aggressive and defensive capacities accurately. King Wei asked, �When the terrain is even and the troops are orderly, and yet they are beaten back in an engagement, what is the reason?� Master Sun said, �The battlefront lacked an elite vanguard.� The function of an elite vanguard is to harass, split up, confuse, and otherwise soften up the adversary. King Wei asked, �How can I get my people to follow orders as an ordinary matter of course?� Master Sun said, �Be trustworthy as an ordinary matter of course.� If ever there was a golden key to the art of leadership, perhaps this is it: To get people to follow orders as a matter of course, be trustworthy as a matter of course. The practical philosopher Confucius is on record as observing that people will not obey leaders they do not trust, even if they are coerced; whereas they will follow leaders they do trust, even when nothing is said. King Wei exclaimed, �Excellent words! The configurations of warfare are inexhaustible!� Inexhaustibility of configurations means endless adaptation. When surprise tactics are repeated over and over, they become conventionalized and lose their strategic value. When conventional tactics are altered unexpectedly according to the situation, they take on the element of surprise and increase in strategic value. Thus it is said that the surprise becomes conventional, while the conventional becomes a surprise. General Tian Ji asked Master Sun, �What causes a militia trouble? What thwarts an opponent? What makes walls impregnable? What makes one miss opportunities? What makes one lose the advantage of the terrain? What causes disaffection of people? May I ask if there are underlying principles governing these things?� Master Sun replied, �There are. Terrain is what causes militias trouble, narrow passages are what thwart opponents. Thus it is said, �A mile of swamp is a commander�s nightmare; . . . to cross over, they leave their full armor behind.� That�s why I say that it is the terrain that troubles an army, narrow passages that thwart an opponent, barbed wire that makes walls impenetrable, � In the original, parts of Sun Bin�s reply are missing. The master�s explanations of how opportunities are missed and how disaffection occurs are lost, but similar themes appear elsewhere in classical strategic lore, being critical issues of leadership. Generally speaking, opportunities are lost through misinformation or lack of information, faulty evaluation of intelligence, lack of courage or initiative, indolence, preoccupation, or similar flaws in basic management. The great civil and military leader Zhuge Liang said, �There are three avenues of opportunity: events, trends, and
