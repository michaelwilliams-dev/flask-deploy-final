At the battle of the Trebia, the Romans were foolishly allowed to fight fasting, whereas Hannibal�s men had breakfasted at their leisure. See Livy, XXI, liv. 8, lv. 1 and 8.] by noonday it has begun to flag; and in the evening, his mind is bent only on returning to camp. 1. A clever general, therefore, avoids an army when its spirit is keen, but attacks it when it is sluggish and inclined to return. This is the art of studying moods. 2. Disciplined and calm, to await the appearance of disorder and hubbub amongst the enemy:�this is the art of retaining self-possession. 3. To be near the goal while the enemy is still far from it, to wait at ease while the enemy is toiling and struggling, to be well-fed while the enemy is famished:�this is the art of husbanding one�s strength. 4. To refrain from intercepting an enemy whose banners are in perfect order, to refrain from attacking an army drawn up in calm and confident array:� this is the art of studying circumstances. 5. It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy, nor to op- pose him when he comes downhill. 6. Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight; do not attack soldiers whose temper is keen. 7. Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy. [Li Ch�uan and Tu Mu, with extraordinary inability to see a metaphor, take these words quite literally of food and drink that have been poisoned by the enemy. Ch�en Hao and Chang Yu carefully point out that the saying has a wider application.] CHAPTER 8. MANEUVERING 67 Do not interfere with an army that is returning home. [The commentators explain this rather singular piece of advice by saying that a man whose heart is set on returning home will fight to the death against any attempt to bar his way, and is therefore too dangerous an op- ponent to be tackled. Chang Yu quotes the words of Han Hsin: "Invincible is the soldier who hath his desire and returneth homewards." A marvelous tale is told of Ts�ao Ts�ao�s courage and resource in ch. 1 of the SAN KUO CHI: In 198 A.D., he was besieging Chang Hsiu in Jang, when Liu Piao sent reinforcements with a view to cutting off Ts�ao�s retreat. The latter was obliged to draw off his troops, only to find himself hemmed in between two enemies, who were guarding each outlet of a narrow pass in which he had engaged himself. In this desperate plight Ts�ao waited until nightfall, when he bored a tunnel into the mountain side and laid an am- bush in it. As soon as the whole army had passed by, the hidden troops fell on his rear, while Ts�ao himself turned and met his pursuers in front, so that they were thrown into confusion and annihilated. Ts�ao Ts�ao said af- terwards: "The brigands tried to check my army in its retreat and brought me to battle in a
