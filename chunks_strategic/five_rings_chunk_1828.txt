Butthere seem tobetwomajor causes forthecurrent distaste forliteral transla- tionsâ€”onerooted inthehistorical science ofourtime, theother rooted inaspecific, and Ibelieve erroneous, view ofthecharacter ofPlatonic books.

If webegin bydenying thefundamental contention ofmen likePlatoand Aristotle, they arerefuted forusfrom theoutset, notbyanyimmanent criticism butbyourunreflecting acceptance oftheself-contradictory principle that allthought isrelated toaspecific ageandhasnograsp of reality beyond thatage./On this basis, itisimpossible totakethem seriously. One often suspects that this iswhat islacking inmany translations: they arenotanimated bythepassion forthetruth; they arereally theresults ofelegant trifling. William ofMoerbeke was motivated bytheconcern thathemight missthemost important coun- selsabout themost important things, counsels emanating from aman wiser than he.Hisknowledge oftheworld andhiswayoflife,nay, his very happiness, depended onthesuccess ofhisquest togetatAris- totle's realmeaning.

Butthatsmile should fadewhen itis [xii] Preface realized that thissense ofsuperiority ismerely theperseveration ofthe confidence, sowidespread inthenineteenth century, thatscience had reached aplateau overlooking broader andmore comprehensible hori- zonsthan those previously known, aconfidence thatourintellectual progress could suffer noreverse. Thisconfidence hasalmost vanished; fewscholars believe thatourperspective istheauthoritative oneany longer; butmuch scholarship stillclings tothehabits which grewupin theshadow ofthatconviction. However, ifthat isnotajustified convic- tion, ifwearereally atseasofarasthetruth ofthings goes, thenour most evident categories arequestionable, andwedonotevenknow whether weunderstand thesimplest questions Plato poses. Itthen behooves ustorediscover theperspective oftheancient authors, forthe sakeboth ofaccurate scholarship andoftrying tofind alternatives to thecurrent mode ofunderstanding things. Itisnotusually understood how difficult itistoseethephe- nomena astheywere seenbytheolder writers.

Forexample, H.D.P.Lee, in describing hisview ofatranslator's responsibility, says,"The translator mustgobehind what Plato saidanddiscover whathemeans, and if,for example, hesays'examining thebeautiful andthegood' must not hesitate torender thisas'discussing moral values' ifthat isinfactthe way inwhich thesame thought would beexpressed today." {The Republic [London: Penguin, 1956], p.48.)But ifonehurries too quickly "behind" Plato's .speech, oneloses thesense ofthesurface. Lee shares with Cornford andmany other translators theassurance that theyhave asufficient understanding ofPlato's meaning, and that thatmeaning ispretty much
