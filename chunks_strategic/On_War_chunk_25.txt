is pursuing a different policy. Conversely, the commander who wishes to adopt different means can reasonably do so only if he assumes his opponent to be equally unwilling to resort to major battles. What has been said about plans and forces being directed to other uses refers only to the positive purposes, other than the destruction of enemy forces, that can be pursued in war. It pertains in no way to pure resistance, which seeks to wear down the opponent's strength. Pure resistance has no positive intention; we can use our forces only to frustrate the enemy's inten? tions, and not divert them to other objectives. Here we must consider the negative side of destroying the enemy's forces-that is, the preservation of our own. These two efforts always go together; they interact. They are integral parts of a single purpose, and we only need to consider the result if one or the other dominates. The effort to destroy the enemy's forces has a positive purpose and leads to positive results, whose final aim is the enemy's collapse. Preserving our own forces has a negative purpose; it frustrates the enemy's intentions-that is, it amounts to pure resistance, whose ultimate aim can only be to prolong the war until the enemy is exhausted. The policy with a positive purpose calls the act of destruction into being; the policy with a negative purpose waits for it. How far such a waiting attitude may or should be maintained is a ques? tion we shall study in connection with the theory of attack and defense, whose basic element is here involved. For the moment we need only say that a policy of waiting must never become passive endurance, that any action involved in it may just as well seek the destruction of the opposing forces as any other objective. It would be a fundamental error to imagine that a negative aim implies a preference for a bloodless decision over the destruction of the enemy. A preponderantly negative effort may of course lead to such a choice, but always at the risk that it is not the appropriate course: that depends on factors that are determined not by us but by the opponent. Avoidance of bloodshed, then, should not be taken as an act of policy if our main concern is to preserve our forces. On the contrary, if such a policy did not suit the particular situation it would lead our forces to disaster. A great many generals have failed through this mistaken assumption. The one certain effect a preponderantly negative policy will have is to 98 retard the decision: in other words, action is transposed into waiting for the decisive moment. This usuallv means that action is postponed in time and space to the extent that spacï¿½e is relevant and circumstances permit. If the time arrives when further waiting would bring excessive disadvantages, then the benefit of the negative policy has been exhausted. The destruction of the enemy-an aim that has until then been
