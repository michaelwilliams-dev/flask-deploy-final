OBSERVANCE OFTHE LAW II In1536 thefuture kingHenri IIofFrance took hisfirst mistress, Diane de Poitiers. Diane was t.hirty—sevenatthetime, and was thewidow ofthe grandseneschal ofNormandy. Henri, meanwhile, was asprightlyladof seventeen, who wasjustbeginningtosow hiswild oats. Atfirst their union seemed merely platonic,with Henri showinganintensely spiritualdevo- tion toDiane. Butitsoon became clear that heloved herinevery way, pre- ferring herbed tothat ofhisyoung wife, Catherine de’Médicis. In1547KingFrancis died and Henri ascended tothethrone. This new situation posed perilsforDiane dePoitiers. She hadjustturned forty-eight, anddespiteher notorious cold baths and rumored youth potions,she was beginningtoshow her age;now that Henri wasking, perhapshewould re- turn tothequeen's bed, and do asother kingshad done—choose mis- tresses from thebevyofbeauties who made theFrench court theenvyof Europe.He was, after all,only twenty-eight,and cut adashing figure.But Diane did notgive upsoeasily.Shewould continue toenthrall herlover, asshehad enthralled him forthepastelevenyears. Diane’s secret weaponswere symbolsandimages,towhich shehad al- ways paid great attention.
