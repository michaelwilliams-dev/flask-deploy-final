last stories before it was all over. Finally, on June 21, she was allowed to return home, and in the back of her mind she sensed the end was coming, the memory of her father�s last days so vivid within her. Pain or no pain, she had to work, to finish the stories and revisions she had started. If she could manage only an hour a day, so be it. She had to squeeze out every last bit of consciousness that remained to her and make use of it. She had realized her destiny as a writer and had led a life of incomparable richness.
