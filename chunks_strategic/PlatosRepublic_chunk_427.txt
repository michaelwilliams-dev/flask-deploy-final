listen to"; here the Scholiast remarks that now the city will "listen instead of being listened to." This con? stitutes an additional condition to the possibility of the good city that had not previously been mentioned; for this reason some scholars have been led to al? ter the passage, but it points to an important difficulty (cf. 473c-d.). 6. The word is dynasteia, derived from the word meaning "power." It is used her_e in contrast to kingship, which implies a legitimate exercise of political rule. Dynasteia is a chiefdom, free from any of the limitations or ad? vantages of legitimacy. It is classed by Aristotle with tyranny or unlimited democracy, regimes without laws in which the sovereign can do as it wishes (Politics, 1242b). In 473d the word translated by chief was dynastes. (Cf. Laws, 680a-b, where the regime of the Cyclopes is called a dynasteia.) 5. Or, ''their arguments are always ad hominem." Literally, "about hu? man beings." 5. Demotike, belonging to the demos, the people at large, the citizen body in a democracy. 6. The word andreikelon also means "a flesh-colored pigment." 7. Another possible reading would be translated as follows: "Or will someone assert that those men whom we excluded are more so?" 8. Cf. 341b. 9. Our word "narcotic" comes from the root of the Greek word (cf. Meno, 80b). 5. In the preceding passage the word for "interest," tokos, also means "offspring." Hence there is an urbane play on money and reproduction, natural and conventional. Aristotle explains the double sense of tokos as follows: Usury is hated with good reason because of its being acquisition from currency itself and not from that for which currency is pro? vided. For currency came into being for the sake of exchange. The tokos makes it more. And it is from that that it got its name. For as ltl.l:!. .t\.l:!..t'UtlLll,; ��the offspring are like the parents, so. tokos breeds currency from currency. And in this way it is of the kinds of moneymaking the most contrary to nature; (Politics, 1258b.) 5. Literally, "the most sun-formed." 6. The Greek means, literally, "to say something good" or "to use words of good omen." It is primarily a word appropriate to religious observ? ance; its opposite is, literally, "blasphemy," and that is what is to be avoided. It is better to say nothing, rather than to use unpropitious expressions. 7. The Greek word means "age,''. and it gets the sense "dignity" be? cause of the honor or right belonging to age. 8. The genitive fon:n of the word for visible, horatou, is, in the Greek orthography, very close to that for heaven, ouranou. The last syllable of 01iranou is identical with the genitive of the word for intelligence (nous), which is the root of the word for intelligible (noeton). (Cf. 494d and note 13; 614b and note 13). There is, hence, a play on the words for heaven-and visi? ble; and, in addition, the question is raised, on the basis of
