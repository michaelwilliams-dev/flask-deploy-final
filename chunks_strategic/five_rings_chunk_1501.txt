play your talents, younaturallystirupallkinds ofresentment, envy,and other manifestations ofinsecurity. This istobeexpected.You cannot spend your lifeworrying about thepetty feelings ofothers. With those above you, however, youmust take adifferent approach: When itcomes topower, outshiningthemaster isperhapstheworst mistake ofall. Donotfoolyourselfintothinkingthat lifehaschanged much since the daysofLouis XIV and theMedicis. Those who attain high standinginlife arelikekingsandqueens: Theywant tofeel secure intheir positions,and superiortothose around them inintelligence, wit, and charm. Itisa.deadly but common misperception tobelieve thatbydisplayingand vaunting your gifts andtalents, youarewinning themaster’s affection. Hemay feign appreciation, but athisfirstopportunityhewillreplace you with someone lessintelligent, lessattractive, lessthreatening, justasLouis XIV replaced thesparkling Fouquetwith thebland Colbert. And aswith Louis, hewill notadmit thetmth, butwillfind anexcuse toridhimself ofyour presence. This Law involves tworules thatyoumust realize, First, youcan inad- vertently outshine amaster simply bybeing yourself. There are masters who are more insecure than others, nronstrously insecure; you maynatu- rallyoutshine them byyourcharm andgrace. No one had more natural talents than Astorre Manfredi, prince of Faenza. The most handsome ofalltheyoung princes ofItaly, hecaptivated hissubjects with hisgenerosity and open spirit. Intheyear 1500, Cesare Borgialaid siege toFaenza. When thecity surrendered, thecitizens expectedthe worst from thecruel Borgia, who, however, decided tospare thetown: Hesimply occupieditsfortress, exe- cuted none ofitscitizens, and allowed Prince Manfredi, eighteenatthe time, toremain with hiscourt, incompletefreedom. Afew weeks later, though, soldiers hauled Astorre Manfrediawaytoa Roman prison.Ayearafter that, hisbodywas fished outofthe River Tiber, astone tied around hisneck. Borgia justifiedthehorrible deed with some sort oftmmped~up charge oftreason andconspiracy,but thereal problemwas that hewasnotoriouslyvain and insecure. Theyoungman wasoutshininghim without even trying. Given Manfredi’s natural talents, theprince’smerepresencemade Borgiaseem less attractive and charis- matic. The lesson issimple: Ifyoucannot help being charmingandsupe~ not, youmust learn toavoid sud: monsters ofvanity. Either that, orfind a waytomuteyour good qualitieswhen inthecompany ofaCesare Borgia. Second, never imaginethat because the master lovesyou, youcan do anything youwant. Entire books could bewritten about favorites who fell outoffavor bytakingtheir status forgranted,fordaringtooutshine. In late-sixteentbcenturyjapan,thefavorite ofEmperor Hideyoshiwas aman called Sen noRikyu.Thepremierartist ofthe teaceremony,which had be- come anobsession with thenobility,he was one ofHideyoshi’smost trusted advisers, had his own apartmentinthepalace,and was honored throughout japan.Yetin1591, Hideyoshihad him arrested and sentenced todeath. Rikyutook hisown life, instead. The cause forhissudden change offortune was discovered later: Itseems thatRikyu, former peasantand later court favorite, had had awooden statue made ofhimself wearingsan- dals (aSign ofnobility)andposing loftily.Hehad had this statue placedin themost important templeinside thepalace gates,inclear sight oftheroy- altywho often wouldpass by.ToHidcyoshithissignifiedthatRikyuhad no sense oflimits. Presurning that hehad the same rightsasthose ofthe highest nobility,hehadforgottenthat hisposition dependedonthe em» peror,and had come tobelieve that hehad earned itonhis own. This was LAW 1 6 LAW 1anunforgivable miscalculation ofhis own importanceand hepaid forit with hislife. Remember thefollowing:Never take your position for granted and never letanyfavorsyoureceive gotoyourhead. Knowingthedangers ofoutshining your master, youcan turn thisLaw toyour advantage. First youmust flatter andpuff upyourmaster. Overt flatterycan beeffective but has itslimits; itistoodirect andobvious, and looks bad toother courtiers. Discreet flatteryismuch more powerful. If youare more intelligent than your master, forexample,seem theopposite: Make himappearmore intelligent than you. Actnaive. Make itseem that youneed hisexpertise. Commit harmless mistakes thatwill nothurt youin thelongrunbutwillgive youthechance toaskforhishelp.Masters adore suchrequests.Amaster who cannot bestow onyouthe ofhisexperi- ence may direct rancor andillwill atyouinstead.
