make forced marches without halting day or night, covering double the usual distance at a stretch, [The ordinary day�s march, according to Tu Mu, was 30 LI; but on one occasion, when pursuing Liu Pei, Ts�ao Ts�ao is said to have covered the incredible distance of 300 _li_ within twenty-four hours.] doing a hundred LI in order to wrest an advantage, the leaders of all your three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy. 8. The stronger men will be in front, the jaded ones will fall behind, and on this plan only one-tenth of your army will reach its destination. [The moral is, as Ts�ao Kung and others point out: Don�t march a hundred LI to gain a tactical advantage, either with or without impedimenta. Man- euvers of this description should be confined to short distances. Stonewall Jackson said: "The hardships of forced marches are often more painful than the dangers of battle." He did not often call upon his troops for ex- traordinary exertions. It was only when he intended a surprise, or when a rapid retreat was imperative, that he sacrificed everything for speed. 1 ] 9. If you march fifty LI in order to outmaneuver the enemy, you will lose the leader of your first division, and only half your force will reach the goal. [Literally, "the leader of the first division will be TORN AWAY."] 10. If you march thirty LI with the same object, two-thirds of your army will arrive. [In the T�UNG TIEN is added: "From this we may know the difficulty of maneuvering."] 11. We may take it then that an army without its baggage- train is lost; without provisions it is lost; without bases of supply it is lost. [I think Sun Tzu meant "stores accumulated in depots." But Tu Yu says "fodder and the like," Chang Yu says "Goods in general," and Wang Hsi says "fuel, salt, foodstuffs, etc."] 1See Col. Henderson, op. cit. vol. I. p. 426. CHAPTER 8. MANEUVERING 63 12. We cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the designs of our neighbors. 13. We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country�its mountains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps. 14. We shall be unable to turn natural advantage to account unless we make use of local guides. [ss. 12-14 are repeated in chap. XI. ss. 52.] 15. In war, practice dissimulation, and you will succeed. [In the tactics of Turenne, deception of the enemy, especially as to the numerical strength of his troops, took a very prominent position. 2 ] 16. Whether to concentrate or to divide your troops, must be decided by cir- cumstances. 17. Let your rapidity be that of the wind, [The simile is doubly appropriate, because the wind is not only swift but, as Mei Yao-ch�en points out, "invisible and leaves no tracks."] your compactness that of the forest.
