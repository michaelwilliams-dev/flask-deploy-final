"That's because youareanagreeable chap!" hesaid."But inad- dition tolearning, payafine inmoney too." "When Igetsome," Isaid. "Hehassome," saidGlaucon. "Now, formoney's sake, speak, Thrasymachus. Weshall allcontribute forSocrates."^i "Icertainly believe it,"hesaid, "sothatSocrates cangetaway e with hisusual trick; he'llnotanswer himself, andwhen someone else hasanswered hegetshold oftheargument andrefutes it." "You bestofmen," Isaid,"how could amananswer who, inthe firstplace, doesnotknow anddoesnotprofess toknow; andwho, in thesecond place, even ifhedoeshavesome supposition about these things, isforbidden tosaywhat hebelieves bynoordinary man? It's^ more fitting foryoutospeak; foryouaretheonewho saysheknows 338a andcan tell.NowdoasIsay; gratifymebyanswering anddon't be- grudge your teaching toGlaucon hereandtheothers." After Isaid this,Glaucon andtheothers begged him todoasI said.AndThrasymachus evidently desired tospeak sothathecould winagood reputation, sincehebelieved hehadavery fineanswer. But hekeptupthepretense ofwanting toprevail onmetodotheanswer- ing.Finally, however, heconceded andthen said: "Here isthewisdom ofSocrates; unwilling himself toteach, he b goesaround learning from others, anddoes noteven givethanks to them." "When yousay Ilearn from others," Isaid,"youspeak thetruth, Thrasymachus; butwhen yousay Idonotmake fullpayment inthanks, you lie.For Ipayasmuch asIcan. Iamonlyable topraise. Ihaveno money. How eagerly Idosowhen Ithink someone speaks well,you willwellknow assoon asyouhave answered; forIsuppose youwill speak well." "Now Hsten," hesaid.

Yousaythejust istheadvantage ofthestronger. What everdoyoumeanbythat,Thrasymachus? Yousurely don't assert such athing asthis: ifPolydamas, thepancratiast,^^ isstronger thanweare [15 1 socrates/thrasymachus therepublic 338d andbeef is'advantageous forhisbody, then thisfood isalso ad- vantageous andjustforuswho areweaker thanheis." "You aredisgusting, Socrates," hesaid."You takehold ofthe argument inthewayyoucanwork itthemost harm.", "Not atall,bestofmen," Isaid. "Just tellmemore clearly what youmean." "Don't youknow," hesaid, "thatsome cities areruled tyrannical- ly,some democratically, andsome aristocratically?" "Ofcourse." "Ineach city, isn'ttheruling group master?" "Certainly." e "And each ruling group setsdovm laws for itsownadvantage; a democracy setsdown democratic laws; atyranny, tyrannic laws; and theothers dothesame.And they declare thatwhat theyhave set dovrai— theirownadvantage— isjust fortheruled, andthemanwho departs from ittheypunish asabreaker ofthelawandadoerofunjust 339a deeds. This, bestofmen, iswhat Imean: inevery citythesame thing isjust,theadvantage oftheestablished ruling body. Itsurely ismaster; sothemanwho reasons rightly concludes thateverywhere justice is thesame thing, theadvantage ofthestronger." "Now," Isaid, "Iunderstand whatyoumean. Whether itistrue ornot, I'lltrytofind out.Now, youtooanswer thatthejust isthead- vantageous, Thrasymachus— although youforbade metogive that answer. Ofcourse, 'forthestronger' isadded ontoit." b "Asmall addition, perhaps," hesaid. "Itisn'tplain yetwhether it'sabigone.But itisplain thatwe must consider whether whatyousay istrue.Thatmustbeconsidered, because, while Itooagree thatthejust issomething ofadvantage, you addtoitandassert that it'stheadvantage ofthestronger, and Idon't know whether it'sso."
