opin? ion those who delight in each thing that is itself?" "Thaf s entirely certain." 479 d e 480a � BOOK VI "And so, Glaucon," I said, "through a somewhat lengthy argu? ment, who the philosophers are and who the nonphilosophers has, with considerable effort, somehow been brought to light." "Perhaps," he said, "that's because it could not easily have been done through a short one." "It doesn't look like it," I said. "Still, in my opinion at least, it would have been better done if this were the only question that had to be treated, and there weren't many things left to treat for one who is go? ing to see what the difference is between the just life and the unjust one." "What's after this for us?" he said. "What else but what's next?" I said. "Since philosophers are those who are able to grasp what is always the same in all respects, while those who are not able to do so but wander among what is many and varies in all ways are not philosophers, which should be the leaders of a city?" "How should we put it so as to speak sensibly?" he said. "Those who look as if they're capable of guarding the laws and practices of cities should be established as guardians." "Right," he said. "But is it plain," I said, "whether it's a blind guardian or a sharp? sighted one who ought to keep watch over anything?"

"No, by Zeus," he said, "there isn't much difference." "Shall we set these men up as guargians rather than those who not only know what each thing is but also don't lack experience or fa]] short of the others in any other part of virtue?" "It would be strange to choose others," he said, "if, that is, these men don't lack the rest. For the very thing in which they would have ' the advantage is just about the most important." "Then shouldn't we say how the same men will be able to possess these two distinct sets of qualities?" "Most certainly." "WeU, then, as we were saying at the beginning of this argument, first their nature must be thoroughly understood. And, I suppose, if we should come to an adequate agreement about that, we'll also agree that the same men will be able to possess both and that there should be no
