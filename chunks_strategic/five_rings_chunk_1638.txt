aman named Pedro Arias Davila, “Pedrarias,” with orders toarrest Bal- boaformurder and totake command ofthecolony. Bythetime Pedrarias arrived inPanama, hehad learned that Balboa had been pardoned,and that hewas toshare thegovernorship with theformer outlaw. Allthe same, Balboa feltuneasy. Gold was hisdream, ElDorado his onlydesire. Inpursuit ofthisgoalhehadnearlydiedmanytimes over, and toshare thewealth andglory with anewcomer would beintolerable. He also soon discovered that Pedraxias was ajealous,bitter man, and equally unhappywith thesituation. Once again,theonlysolution forBel» boa was toseize theinitiative byproposingtocross thejunglewith a larger army, carrying shipbuildingmaterials and tools. Once onthe Pa— cific coast, hewould create anarmada. with which toconquer the Incas. Surprisingly enough, Pedrarias agreed totheplan—--perhaps sensingit would never work. Hundreds died inthis second march through thejun- gle, and thetimber theycarried rotted inthetorrential rains. Balboa, as usual, was undaunted»-nopowerintheworld could thwart hisplan—and onarrivingatthePacific hebegantocutdown trees fornew lumber. But the men remaining tohim were toofew and tooweak tomount aninva- sion, and once againBalboa had toreturn toDarien. Pedrarias had inanycase invited Balboa back todiscuss anew plan, and ontheoutskirts ofthesettlement, theexplorerwas metbyFrancisco Pizarro, anoldfriend who hadaccompanied him onhisfirst crossingof theisthmus. But this was atrap: Leadingone hundred soldiers, Pizarro surrounded hisformer friend, arrested him, and returned him toFe draiias, who tried him oncharges ofrebellion. Afewdays later Ba.lboa’s head fellinto abasket, alongwith those ofhis most trusted followers. Years later Pizarro himself reached Peru, and Balboa’s deeds were for- gotten.

Balboa had adream ofgloryandwealth, and avague plantoreach it. Yethisbold deeds, and hisdiscovery ofthePacific, arelargely forgotten, forhecommitted what intheworld ofpoweristheultimate sin:He went part way, leaving thedooropenforothers totake over. Areal man of powerwould have had theprudencetoseethedangersinthe distance—— therivals who would want toshare intheconquests,the vultures that would hover once theyheard theword “gold.”Balboa should have kept hisknowledgeoftheIncas secret until after hehadconquered Peru. Only then would hiswealth, and hishead, have been secure. Once Pedrarias ar- rived onthe scene, aman ofpowerandprudencewould have schemed to kill orimprison him, and totake over thearmyhehadbrought forthe conquestofPeru. But Balboa was locked inthemoment, always reacting emotionally,never thinking ahead.

OBSERVANCE OFTHE LAW In1863 thePrussian premierOtto von Bismarck surveyed thechessboard ofEuropean powerasitthen stood. The main playerswere England, France, and Austria. Prussia itself was one ofseveral states intheloosely allied German Federation. Austria, dominant member oftheFederation, made sure that theother German states remained weak, divided and sub» missive. Bismarck believed that Prussia was destined forsomethingfar greaterthan servant boytoAustria. This ishow Bismarck playedthegame.Hisfirst move was tostart a warwithlowly Denmark, inorder torecover theformer Prussian lands of Schleswig—Holstein,Heknew that these rumblings ofPrussian indepen- dence might worryFrance andEngland,soheenlisted Austria inthewar, claiming that hewasrecovering Schleswig-Holsteinfortheir benefit. lna fewmonths, after the war was decided, Bismarck demanded that the newly conqueredlands bemade part ofPrussia. The Austrians ofcourse were furious, butthey compromised:First they agreed togivethePrus- aians Schleswig,and ayearlater theysold them Holstein. The world began toseethat Austria wasweakening and that Prussia was ontherise. Bismarck’s next move was hisboldest: In1866 heconvinced King William ofPrussia towithdraw from theGerman
