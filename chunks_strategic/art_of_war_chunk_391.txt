Shigeo interprets it in the sense of sukunashi. He translates it into modern Japanese as �Sono riten wa sukunai.� (4, p. 81) Terayama Danchu keeps the expression sono ri ooshi, but he attaches it to the next sentence. He has �Sono riten no ooi nodewa jokaku no naka kara no teppo ni masarumono wa nai,� which translates as �There is nothing more advantageous than shooting guns from the inside of a fortress.� (11, p. 113) 65. As Musashi has already said, generally warriors carried two swords, the long and the short. The size of a pair of swords varied according to personal choice. The size of a sword was normally measured by the length of the blade, but to get a real idea of the dimensions of a sword, it was necessary to take into account the thickness, breadth, curve, and form of the edge, which composed the overall form of the blade, as well as the quality of the steel. Among the different possible sizes of pairs of swords, Musashi advises choosing large sizes. 66. �Cadence,� hyoshi: The notion of hyoshi has major importance in the Gorin no sho. The term does not have an exact equivalent in English and poses significant translation problems (see �Hyoshi� in the appendix). 67. �Musicians with their stringed or wind instruments,� reijin kange: Reijin means �a person who plays music.� This word refers in particular to an officer who is a musician playing the traditional official music known as gagaku at the court for the nobles and also in shrines and temples. Kan refers to stringed instruments and gen to wind instruments. 68. �That which does not have a visible form,� ku naru koto: Ku means sky, heaven, emptiness, or space (see �Ku� in the appendix). 1. 69. �The concordant cadences and . . . the discordant ones,� hazu no au hyoshi, hazu no chigau hyoshi: Hazu refers to the two ends of a bow where the string is attached. It also refers to the notched end of an arrow that fits onto the bowstring. This is called more precisely the ya hazu. On the basis of this image, hazu also means �that which is thought will normally happen, that which is reasonable, reason.� It is also used in the sense of �plan� or �promise.� 70. I will try to convey a more concrete notion of these different forms of cadences or hyoshi. � �The striking cadence (or hyoshi)�: ataru hyoshi. � �The interval cadence,� or more precisely, �the hyoshi that places you in the interval between actions�: ma no hyoshi. This term refers to all the rhythmic elements that can develop in an interval or the moment of void, however short it may be, that occurs between two movements or between two phases of the breathing process. Such moments of void occur when a person is in movement as well as when he is not moving, for example, when he is in a guard position. If your level is high enough, you
