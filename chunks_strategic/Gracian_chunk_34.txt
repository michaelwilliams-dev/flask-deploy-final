rind becomes disabused when you show the kernel. Lies always come �rst, dragging fools along by their irreparable vulgarity. Truth always lags last, limping along on the arm of Time. The wise therefore reserve for it the other half of that power which the common mother has wisely given in duplicate. Deceit is very super�cial, and the super�cial therefore easily fall into it. Prudence lives retired within its recesses, visited only by sages and wise men. Do not be Inaccessible. None is so perfect that he does not need at times the advice of others. He is an in-corrigible ass who will never listen to any one. Even the most surpassing intellect should �nd a place for friendly counsel. Sovereignty itself must learn to lean.

But when held with persons to whom one would show respect, it should be more digni�ed to answer to the dignity of the person addressed. To be appropriate it should adapt itself to the mind and tone of the interlocutor. And do not be a critic of words, or you will be taken for a pedant; nor a taxgatherer of ideas, or men will avoid you, or at least sell their thoughts dear. in conversation discretion is more important than eloquence. Know how to put off Ills on Others. To have a shield against ill-will is a great piece of skill in a ruler. It is not the resort of incapacity, as ill-wishers imagine, but is due to the higher policy of having some one to receive the censure of the disa.ected and the punishment of universal detestation. Everything cannot turn out well, nor can every one be satis�ed: it is
