of power that can be physically quantified: �In military matters it is not necessarily beneficial to have more, only to avoid acting aggressively; it is enough to consolidate your power, assess opponents, and win people, that is all.� The I Ching says, �When you have means but are not getting anywhere, seek appropriate associates, and you will be lucky.� Similarly emphasizing directed group effort, The Art of War says, �The individualist without strategy who takes opponents lightly will inevitably become a captive.� Solidarity calls especially for mutual understanding and rapport between the leadership and the followers, achieved through both education and training. The Confucian sage Mencius said, �Those who send people on military operations without educating them ruin them.� Master Sun says, �Direct them through cultural arts, unify them through martial arts; this means certain victory.� The I Ching says, �It is lucky when the rulers nourish the ruled, watching them and bringing out their talents.� The tenth chapter, on terrain, continues the ideas of tactical maneuvering and adaptability, outlining types of terrain and appropriate ways of adjusting to them. It requires some thought to transfer the patterns of these types of terrain to other contexts, but the essential point is in consideration of the relationship of the protagonist to the configurations of the material, social, and psychological environment. Master Sun follows this with remarks about fatal organizational deficiencies for which the leadership is responsible. Here again emphasis is on the morale of unity: �Look upon your soldiers as beloved children, and they willingly die with you.� The I Ching says, �Those above secure their homes by kindness to those below.� Nevertheless, extending the metaphor, Master Sun also warns against being overly indulgent, with the result of having troops who are like spoiled children. Intelligence, in the sense of preparatory knowledge, is also stressed in this chapter, where it is particularly defined as including clear awareness of the capabilities of one�s forces, the vulnerabilities of opponents, and the lay of the land: �When you know yourself and others, victory is not in danger; when you know sky and earth, victory is inexhaustible.� The I Ching says, �Be careful in the beginning, and you have no trouble in the end.� The eleventh chapter, entitled �Nine Grounds,� presents a more detailed treatment of terrain, particularly in terms of the relationship of a group to the terrain. Again, these �nine grounds� can be understood to apply not only to simple physical territory, but also to �territory� in its social and more abstract senses. The nine grounds enumerated by Master Sun in this chapter are called a ground of dissolution, light ground, ground of contention, trafficked ground, intersecting ground, heavy ground, bad ground, surrounded ground, and dying (or deadly) ground. A ground of dissolution is a stage of internecine warfare or civil strife. Light ground refers to shallow incursion into others� territory. A ground of contention is a position that would be advantageous to either side of a conflict. Trafficked ground is where there
