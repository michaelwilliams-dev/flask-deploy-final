OBSERVANCE OFTHE LAW In1502, inFlorence, Italy,an enormous block ofmarble stood inthe worksdepartmentofthechurch ofSanta Maria delFiore. Ithad once been amagnificent pieceofraw stone, but anunskillful sculptorhadmistakenly bored aholethroughitwhere there should have been afigure’s legs, gen- erally mutilatingit.Piero Soderini, Florence’smayor,hadcontemplated tryingtosave theblock bycommissioning Leonardo daVinci towork on it,orsome other master, buthadgiven up, since everyone agreedthat the stone had been ruined. So,despitethemoneythat had been wasted onit,it gathered dust inthedark halls ofthechurch. This was where things stood until some Florentine friends ofthegreat Michelangelodecided towrite totheartist, thenlivinginRome. Healone, they said, could dosomething with themarble, which was stillmagnificent rawmaterial. Michelangelotraveled toFlorence, examined thestone, and came totheconclusion that hecould infact carve afinefigure from it,by adaptingtheposetotheway therock had been mutilated. Soderini argued that this was awaste oftime——nobodycould salvagesuch adisasterwbut hefinally agreedtoletthe artist work onit.Michelangelo decided he would depicta.young David, slinginhand. Weeks later, asMichelangelowasputtingthefinal touches onthe statue, Soderini entered thestudio. Fancying himself itbitofaconnoisseur, he.-studied thehuge work, and toldMichelangelothat while hethoughtit wasmagnificent, the nose, hejudged,was toobig.Michelangelorealized thatSoderini wasstandingin2place right under thegiant figureand did nothave theproper perspective. Without aword, hegesturedforSoderini tofollow himupthescaffolding. Reachingthe nose, hepicked uphis aswell asabitofmarble dust thatlayontheplanks.

Heactually didnothing tochangethe nose, butgave every appearance ofworkingonit.After afew minutes ofthischarade he stood aside: “Look atitnow.” “Ilike itbetter,” replied Soderini, “you’ve made itcome alive.”¢lu;;_\‘.
