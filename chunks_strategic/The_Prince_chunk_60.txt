never finds such a prudent man as can accommodate to this, ei.ther because he cannot change his own nature or because, having been successful one way, he can�t part from the given path. A cautious man, when the time comes to be bold, can�t do it. He gets ruined. If one could change with the nature of the times and with circumstances, fortune would not change. Pope Julius II operated impetuously in all his affairs. This suited times and circumstances and he was successful. Consider his first moves in Bologna when Giovanni Bentivogli was still alive. The Venetians looked askance this, the King of Spain at also. France objected. But Julius II personally moved so fero.on ciously and rapidly that he stood the Spanish and Venetians their ears � the Venetians were afraid, while the Spanish hoped to recover the whole Kingdom of Naples. Louis the XII of France to fell into place because seeing Spain move he hoped stay THE PRINCE �-129 friends in order to put down the Venetians , and thought that to re.fuse military aid would be an offence . So , Julius II brought off with his impetuousness what no other Pope could have done through prudence . If he had only thought to leave Rome when things were in hand and everything set, as any other Pontiff would have done , he would never have suc. ceeded . France would have made military excuses and the others a thousand fears . I won't mention his other ventures , all of which were similar, all successful . In the shortness of his life , it never turned out otherwise . If times had come for caution, he would have been ruined . He never could have acted otherwise because he was so inclined by nature . So , my conclusion is that fortune changes and men when they stick by their methods are successful as long as they agree with fortune , but when things change , they go wrong . On the whole , it is better to be impetuous than cautious because fortune is a woman. It is necessary, to keep her down, to surprise and force her . She gives in more to that than to those who proceed coldly. Fortune , like women, is friends of youth, because youth is less cautious , more ferocious , and its audacity dazzles them.
