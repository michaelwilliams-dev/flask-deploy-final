the sense, and we get no help from them there. The Chinese words Sun Tzu used to indicate the cause of the people�s impoverishment clearly have reference to some system by which the husbandmen sent their contributions of corn to the army direct. But why should it fall on them to maintain an army in this way, except because the State or Government is too poor to do so?] 11. On the other hand, the proximity of an army causes prices to go up; and high prices cause the people�s substance to be drained away. [Wang Hsi says high prices occur before the army has left its own territory. Ts�ao Kung understands it of an army that has already crossed the frontier.] 12. When their substance is drained away, the peasantry will be afflicted by heavy exactions. 13. ,14. With this loss of substance and exhaustion of strength, the homes of the people will be stripped bare, and three-tenths of their income will be dis- sipated; [Tu Mu and Wang Hsi agree that the people are not mulcted not of 3/10, but of 7/10, of their income. But this is hardly to be extracted from our text. Ho Shih has a characteristic tag: "The PEOPLE being regarded as CHAPTER 3. WAGING WAR 36 the essential part of the State, and FOOD as the people�s heaven, is it not right that those in authority should value and be careful of both?"] while government expenses for broken chariots, worn-out horses, breast- plates and helmets, bows and arrows, spears and shields, protective mantles, draught-oxen and heavy wagons, will amount to four-tenths of its total rev- enue. 15. Hence a wise general makes a point of foraging on the enemy. One cart- load of the enemy�s provisions is equivalent to twenty of one�s own, and likewise a single PICUL of his provender is equivalent to twenty from one�s own store. [Because twenty cartloads will be consumed in the process of transporting one cartload to the front. A PICUL is a unit of measure equal to 133.3 pounds (65.5 kilograms).] 16. Now in order to kill the enemy, our men must be roused to anger; that there may be advantage from defeating the enemy, they must have their rewards. [Tu Mu says: "Rewards are necessary in order to make the soldiers see the advantage of beating the enemy; thus, when you capture spoils from the enemy, they must be used as rewards, so that all your men may have a keen desire to fight, each on his own account."] 17. Therefore in chariot fighting, when ten or more chariots have been taken, those should be rewarded who took the first. Our own flags should be substituted for those of the enemy, and the chariots mingled and used in conjunction with ours. The captured soldiers should be kindly treated and kept. 18. This is called, using the conquered foe to augment one�s own strength. 19. In war, then, let your great object be victory, not lengthy
