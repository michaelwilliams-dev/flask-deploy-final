Schiippach,who had become known assimplythe“Mountain Doc- tor,” had asmall pharmacyintown. This placebecame quiteascene: Crowds ofpeoplefrommany different countries would cram thesmall room, itswalls lined with colorful bottles filled with herbal cures. Where most doctors ofthetime prescribed foul-tastingconcoctions that bore in- comprehensibleLatin titles (asmedicines often dostill), Schiippaclfscures had names such as“The Oilofjoy,” “Little Flower’s Heart,” or“Against theMonster,” andthey tasted sweet andpleasing. Visitors toLangnau would have towait patiently for avisit with the Mountain Doctor, becauseevery daysome eighty messengers would arrive atthepharmacy bearingflasks ofurine from allover Europe. Schiippach claimed hecould diagnose what ailedyousimply bylookingatasampleof yourmine andreadingawritten description ofyourailment. (Naturallyhe read thedescription very carefullybefore prescribingacure.) When hefl» nallyhad aspareminute (the urine samples took upmuch ofhistime), he would callthevisitor into hisoffice inthepharmacy.Hewould then exam- inethisperson’s urine sample, explainingthat itsappearancewould tell himeverythinghe needed toknow. Country peoplehad asense forthese things,hewould say——their wisdom came from livingasimple, godlylife with none ofthecomplications ofurban living.This personalconsultation would also include adiscussion astohow onemight bringone’s soul more intoharmonywith nature. Schiippachhad devisedmanyforms oftreatment, eachprofoundlyun~ liketheusual medicalpracticesofthetime.
