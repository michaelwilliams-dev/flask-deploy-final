who had banded themselves together under their chosen leaders, andof THE PRINCE —15 fered their services tothehighest bidder. Their numbers were continually being increased byrecruitment from amongst Italian brigands, malcontents from conquered republics, andother bold spirits insearch ofadventure. Battles inthose days were won or lostbytheheavily armed cavalry, ormen-at-arms, anditwasof these thatthemercenary bands, orfreecompanies, mostly con- sisted. Asthere was noother similarly armed Italian troops to withstand them, mercenaries were inevitably found fighting on both sides inevery local war, andthey soon realized there was nothing tobegained bytheir mutual destruction. Butalthough they didlittle damage toeach other, their pillaging andsacking brought terror anddesolation tothepeaceful population. Asthese bands multiplied, they tended tocombine under the leadership ofsome exceptionally successful captain, andheinhis turn, assoon ashehadasufficient following, would retain for himself some town hehadcaptured forthisemployers, andmake itthecenter round which tocarve outanew petty state under his own rule. Thus arose thenumberless tyrants who played solarge apartinItaly’s history during thischaotic period. These small ty- rants, having nonatural tieswith thecitizens oftheir new states, andonly keeping their position bythemost severe measures of repression, were generally hated andbecame abyword forruth- lesscruelty. And yetthey were such arecognized feature ofthe times thattheir deceit andcruelties ceased tobethesubject of moral blame; onthecontrary, themore ruthless andtreacherous their conduct, thegreater prestige they acquired —provided al- ways thattheir crimes were crowned with success. Ofthese oneofthemost notorious was Caesar Borgia, of whom wehear somuch from Machiavelli.

Long before Machiavelli's time certain districts inItaly had emerged from the general confusion inthe form ofcomparatively permanent and powerful states .The so-called Republic ofFlor- ence ,under the veiled autocracy ofthe Medici ,was the master of the greater part ofTuscany .The many small republics ofLom- bardy had been welded together bythe Visconti and Sforza into the Duchy ofMilan .With her adjoining mainland ,Venice was ruled bythe strictly limited and hereditary Grand Council ,under the presidency ofthe Doge .The Kingdom ofNaples ,under the nominal suzerainty ofthe Pope ,was held by the House of Aragon ,though kept inaconstant state ofunrest byanumber of turbulent barons .And successive Popes ,lacking inspiritual au- thority ,had endeavored tocreate astable temporal state for the Church out ofthe territories stretching northwards from Rome , though without signal success .But these states were alljealous rivals ofeach other ,and constantly atwar ,while the remainder of Italy was still divided into numberless smaller states which had by now mostly fallen into the hands ofupstart tyrants .
