be no help in making progress and would also be impossible to defend afterward. If one�s force is insufficient, Sun Tzu continues, a citadel will surely not be taken; but even if a citadel would surrender if besiegers had advantageous conditions, and even if no loss would ensue if conditions were not favorable for a siege, under these conditions a citadel is not to be attacked. Land not to be contested refers to wilderness where soldiers cannot live off the land. Orders not to be followed are those that contradict the foregoing four adaptations. In The Yellow Emperor�s Defeat of the Red Emperor, Sun Tzu recounts the tactics used by the semimythological Chinese cultural hero Huang Di, �The Yellow Emperor,� in rising to ascendancy over neighboring tribes. When Huang Di attacked tribes to the south, east, north, and west, in each case he kept the shady sides of mountains to his right, followed strategic routes, kept natural barriers to his back, and thus destroyed his opponents and annexed their territories. Then he let the people rest, allowing the cereal crops to ripen, and declared amnesty. [ 1 ] Strategic Measurements War is a national crisis; it is necessary to examine the grounds of death and life and the ways to survival and extinction. Thus you measure militias in terms of five parameters, comparing them in terms of strategic measurements to find out the real situation. First is guidance. Second is climate. Third is ground. Fourth is leadership. Fifth is order. Guidance is what induces popular accord with the rulership, so the people are willing to follow it to death and follow it in life, without opposition. Climate refers to darkness and light, cold and heat, the structure of the seasons. Ground may be high or low, near or far, treacherous or easy, broad or narrow, deadly or viable. Leadership is a matter of knowledge, trustworthiness, humaneness, valor, and strictness. Order involves organizational structure, chain of command, and logistics. All leaders have heard of these five things; those who know them prevail over those who do not. That is why we make comparisons in terms of strategic measurements�to find out the real situation. Which civil leadership has guidance? Which military leadership has ability? Whose climate and grounds are advantageous? Whose order is enforced? Whose forces are stronger? Whose officers and soldiers are better trained? Whose rewards and punishments are clearer? In this way I know who is going to win and who is going to lose. If leaders listen to my strategy, their military actions will be victorious. Then I will stay. If leaders do not listen to my strategy, their military actions will be failures. Then I will leave. One can assess advantages through listening, then take up an appropriate posture or make an appropriate disposition to bolster one�s exterior. To take up a posture or a disposition means to manipulate strategy according to advantage. Warfare is a path of subterfuge. That is why you make a show of incompetence
