death. Master Sun A surrounded army must be given a way out. CAO CAO The ancient rule of the charioteers says, �Surround them on three sides, leaving one side open, to show them a way to life.� DU MU Show them a way to life so that they will not be in the mood to fight to the death, and then you can take advantage of this to strike them. Master Sun Do not press a desperate enemy. MEI YAOCHEN An exhausted animal will still fight, as a matter of natural law. ZHANG YU If the opponents burn their boats, destroy their cooking pots, and come to fight it out once and for all, don�t press them, for when animals are desperate they thrash about wildly. Master Sun These are rules of military operations. [ 8 ] Adaptations ZHANG YU Adaptation means not clinging to fixed methods, but changing appropriately according to events, acting as is suitable. Master Sun The general rule for military operations is that the military leadership receives the order from the civilian leadership to gather armies. Let there be no encampment on difficult terrain. Let diplomatic relations be established at borders. Do not stay in barren or isolated territory. When on surrounded ground, plot. When on deadly ground, fight. JIA LIN Being on surrounded ground means there is steep terrain on all sides, with you in the middle, so that the enemy can come and go freely but you have a hard time getting out and back. When you are on ground like this, you should set up special plans ahead of time to prevent the enemy from bothering you, thus balancing out the disadvantage of the ground. LI QUAN Place an army in a deadly situation and the soldiers will make it their own fight. Master Sun There are routes not to be followed, armies not to be attacked, citadels not to be besieged, territory not to be fought over, orders of civilian governments not to be obeyed. LI QUAN If there are narrow straits along the way and there may be ambush attacks, that road should not be taken. DU MU Don�t attack crack troops, don�t try to stop a returning army, don�t press a desperate enemy, don�t attack a ground of death. And if you are strong and the enemy is weak, don�t strike their vanguard, lest you frighten the rest into retreating. CAO CAO It may be possible to strike an army, but not advisable, because the lay of the land makes it hard to persist, to stay there would mean loss of further gains, present gains would in any case be slight, and a desperate army will fight to the death. When a citadel is small and secure, and has plenty of supplies, then do not besiege it. When a territory is of marginal benefit and is as easy to lose as it is to win, then don�t fight over it. When it is a matter of expediting your work, don�t
