Selassie knew the royal couplehated him and wanted togetridofhim, sotocutshort their plottinghemade Gugsa thegovernor ofthe northern province of Begemeder, forcinghim toleave thecapital,where theempress lived. For severalyears Gugsa playedtheloyaladministrator. But Selassie did not trust him: Heknew thatGugsa and theempresswere plottingre- venge.Astime passedand Gugsamade nomove, thechances ofaplot only increased. Selassie knew what hehad todo: draw Gugsa out, get under hisskin, andpushhim into action before hewasready. For severalyears,anorthern tribe, theAzebu Gallas, had been invir» tual rebellion against thethrone, robbingandpillaginglocal villages and refusingtopaytaxes. Selassie had done nothingtostop them, lettingthem grow stronger. Finally, in1929, heordered Ras Gugsa tolead ananny againstthese disobedient tfibesmen. Gugsa agreed,butinwardlyhe seethed--he had nogmdge againsttheAzebu Gallas, and thedemand that hefightthem hurt hispride. Hecould notdisobeytheorder, but ashe worked toputtogetheranarmy, hebegan tospreadanugly rumor«-that Selassie was incahoois with thepope,andplannedtoconvert thecountry toRoman Catholicism and make itacolony ofItaly. Gugsifs army swelled, and some ofthetribes from which itssoldiers came secretly agreed tofight Selassie. InMarch of1930 anenormous force of35,000 men beganto march, not ontheAzebu Gallas butsouih, toward thecapital ofAddis Ababa. Made confident byhisgrowing strength, Gugsa.now openly led a holywar todeposeSelassie andputthecountryback inthehands oftrue Christians. Hedidnot seethetrap that had been laid forhim. Before Selassie had ordered GugsatofighttheAzebu Gallas, hehad secured thesupportofthe Ethiopianchurch. And before therevolt gotunderway,hehadbribed sev- eral ofGugsa’s keyallies not toshowupforbattle. Astherebelarmy marched south, airplanesflew overhead droppingleaflets announcingthat thehighestchurch officials hadrecognized Selassie asthe tme Christian leader ofEthiopia,and thatthey had excommunicated Gugsa forfoment- ingacivil war. These leaflets severelyblunted the emotions behind the holy crusade. And asbattle loomed and thesupportthatGugsa’sallies had promisedhim failed toshowup,soldiers begantoflee ordefect. When thebattle came, therebel army quicky collapsed. Refusingto surrender, Ras Gugsawas killed inthefighting. The empress, distraught over her l1usba.nd’s death, died afewdayslater. OnApril 80,Selassie is- sued aformal proclamation announcing hisnew title: Emperor ofEthiopia. Interpretation Haile Selassie alwayssaw several moves ahead. Heknew thatifheletRas Gugsadecide thetime andplace oftherevolt, thedanger would bemuch greaierthan ifheforced Gngsatoact onSelassie’s terms. Sohegoaded him into rebellion byoffending hismanly pride, askinghim tofight peoplehe had noquarrelwith onbehalf ofaman hehated. Thinking everythingout ahead, Selassie made sure thatGugsa’s rebellion would come tonothing, andthat hecould useittodoawaywith hislasttwo enemies.
