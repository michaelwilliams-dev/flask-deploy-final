Late thatyearthemysterious Bragaclinoarrived inVenice. With his piercingdarkeyes under thick brows, and thetwo enormous black mastiffs thataccompaniedhimeverywhere,he wasforbiddingandimpressive.He tookupresidence inasumptuous palaceontheisland oftheGiudecca, with therepublic fundinghisbanquets, hisexpensive clothes, and allhis other whims. Akind ofalchemyfever spread through Venice. On street corners, hawkers would sellcoal, distilling apparatus, bellows, how—to books onthesubject. Everyone began topractice alchemyw-everyoneex— ceptBragadino. The alchemist seemed tobeinnohurrytobegin manufacturing the goldthat would save Venice from ruin. Strangely enoughthisonlyin- creased hispopularityandfollowing; people thronged from allover Eu- rope,even Asia, tomeet thisremarkable man. Months went by,with gifts pouringintoBragadinofrom allsides. Still hegavenosign ofthemiracle thattheVenetians confidently expected him toproduce. Eventually thecit- izens begantogrow impatient, wondering ifhewould wait forever. Atfirst thesenators warned them not tohurryhim-—-he was acapricious devil, who needed tobecajoled. Finally, though, thenobility begantowonder too,and thesenate came underpressuretoshow areturn onthecity’sba.l~ looninginvestment. Bragadino hadonlyscorn forthedoubters, butherespondedtothem.

Others, however, wereangry:seven moreyears ofthis man liv- ingroyallyatthepublic trough! Andmany ofthe common citizens of Venice echoed these sentiments. Finallythealchemist‘s enemies demanded heproduceaproofofhisskills: asubstantial amount ofgold, and soon. Lofty, apparentlydevoted tohisart,Bragadino respondedthatVenice, initsimpatience,hadbetrayed him, and would therefore lose hisservices. Helefttown, goingfirst tonearby Padua, then, in1590, toMunich, atthe invitation oftheDuke ofBavaria, who, like theentire cityofVenice, had known great wealth buthad fallen intobankruptcy through his ownprofli- gacy, andhopedtoregain hisfortune through thefamous alchemist’s ser- vices. And soBragadinoresumed thecomfortable arrangement hehad known inVenice, and the same pattern repeateditself. Interpretation Theyoung Cypriot Mamugna had lived inVenice forseveralyearsbefore reincamatinghimself asthealchemist Bragadino.He saw how gloomhad settled onthecity, howeveryonewashopingfor aredemption from some indefinite source. While other charlatans mastered everydaycons based on sleight ofhand, Mamugnamastered human nature. With Venice ashistar- getfrom the start, hetraveled abroad, made somemoney through his alchemy scams, and then returned toItaly, setting upshopinBrescia. There hecreated areputation that heknew would spreadtoVenice. From adistance, infact, his aura ofpowerwould beallthe more impressive.
