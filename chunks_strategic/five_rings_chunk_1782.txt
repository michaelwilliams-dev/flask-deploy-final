successful politician. Isitpreferable tobeloved rather than hated, tolierather than tellthetruth, ortobehonest ortobedishonest? Fordifferent rea- sons, Machiavelli would ascribe anyifnotallofthese attributes tomen andwomen engaged inconducting public office. Neces- sityoften precludes being loved, anddissimulation likewise may preclude honesty, because only fools, dressed inwool, would travel inthecompany ofwolves. Untrusting ofhuman nature, Machiavelli easily understood themotives behind theactions ofpeople inthepast andinthe present, butwould have adifficult time understanding thelogic behind those actions. Hewould have loathed theatrocities ofWorld War I,with the Xbayonets andgases spewing over innocent civilians andcom- batants alike. Unfortunately, wehave learned fewlessons from thatsavagery, either forourselves orforourfuture generations. During theSpanish Civil War, theCommunists andFascists fought against each other onbehalf oftheSpanish people. Many foreigners knowingly chose tofight insupport ofthegood side, theCommunist. And inhonor ofthegood side, Pablo Picasso created hismasterpiece, Guernica, which stands fortheir efforts, their dedications and their convictions. These sacrificed their lives while inRussia, Communists were pulverizing millions of people with themost inhuman kinds oftorture. And noonemade aripple ofasingle demonstration against those atrocities, even when similar ones took place inChina. THE PRINCE —11 How does oneexplain thesupport given toregimes, which have killed over 90million innocent people? Why would anyone choose regimes thatforced people tokillorbekilled? Inview of thefacts, Machiavelli would behard putforwords. When greater savagery took place inGermany, hardly anyone demonstrated against those atrocities, while leaders from other nations appeased theconquering tyrant, because hewasdoing it tosomeone else. During theVietnam War, people demonstrated against the war, butnever against those who were committing genocide by exterminating millions ofinnocent fellow beings tofulfill tenets ofpolitical systems spawned inforeign countries. Hundreds ofthousands demonstrated forSaddam Hussein, who torched numberless oilfields whose uncontrolled blazes contaminated atmosphere andland alike; thousands more demon- strated onhisbehalf even when hisweapons ofmass destruction (whose only purpose istokillordegrade life)were obviously be- ingstored foruseagainst other human beings. And people will- ingly became human shields indemonstrating onbehalf ofthis committed tyrant, who, onhaving invaded three countries, having mounted amissile attack onafourth, andhaving used deadly gas thatkilled thousands, notoneperson orgroup orthePope was found significantly demonstrating against himoragainst hisdes- potic regime. There arealways allkinds ofrationale behind thisbehavior. Butultimately, asMachiavelli observed, wearealldriven byour twobasic instincts, which areblind andunresponsive tothebrain andtotheheart. Oneneeds toconsider thebehavior oftworepre- sentative individuals, byasking, even ifrhetorically, Where would America be,in2003, hadLindbergh been the leader toimplement hisconvictions onthenation during World War IIinstead ofPresident Roosevelt implementing his? With hisperception ofan“evil” America, would itbeagood America forthegrandchildren ofChomsky were he,in2003, to betheleader toimplement hisconvictions onthenation instead ofPresident Bush implementing his? 12— Niccolò Machiavelli Although these kinds ofindividuals speak with persuasive diligence, intheface ofrealpolitics, they only bring about de- struction tothemselves andtoothers. Machiavelli would deny anyconnection between their perceived world andtherealworld ofhunger andpower, forheneither believed insuicide norinthe destruction ofother human beings. Machiavelli wrote ThePrince asamanual toenlighten lead- ersonways togood government inspite ofthecompulsive ag- gressiveness existing inallofus.Hewould have seconded gov- ernment programs thatallow thelargest number ofpeople topur- suethemaximum amount ofhappiness. Herealized thathappi- ness isattainable only when governors lead thegoverned inan atmosphere ofharmony andbalance. Good government andgreat civilizations gohand inhand. When good governments fallshort, tragic anomalies usually trample anddebase human life;andaslong astheyexist, thesug- gestions inThePrince may serve asanantidote
