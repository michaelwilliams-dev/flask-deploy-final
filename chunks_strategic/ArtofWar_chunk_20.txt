great deal that they find in the say- ings, coming generations will have constant reason to thank my friend Sheng-yu. Making some allowance for the exuberance of friendship, I am inclined to en- dorse this favorable judgment, and would certainly place him above Ch�en Hao in order of merit. 1. WANG HSI, also of the Sung dynasty, is decidedly original in some of his in- terpretations, but much less judicious than Mei Yao-ch�en, and on the whole not a very trustworthy guide. He is fond of comparing his own commentary with that of Ts�ao Kung, but the comparison is not often flattering to him. We learn from Ch�ao Kung-wu that Wang Hsi revised the ancient text of Sun Tzu, filling up lacunae and correcting mistakes.44 2. HO YEN-HSI of the Sung dynasty. The personal name of this commentator is given as above by Cheng Ch�iao in the TUNG CHIH, written about the middle of the twelfth century, but he appears simply as Ho Shih in the YU HAI, and Ma Tuan-lin quotes Ch�ao Kung-wu as saying that his personal name is unknown. There seems to be no reason to doubt Cheng Ch�iao�s statement, otherwise I should have been inclined to hazard a guess and identify him with one Ho Ch�u- fei, the author of a short treatise on war, who lived in the latter part of the 11th century. Ho Shih�s commentary, in the words of the T�IEN-I-KO catalogue, "contains helpful additions" here and there, but is chiefly remarkable for the copious extracts taken, in adapted form, from the dynastic histories and other sources. 3. CHANG YU. The list closes with a commentator of no great originality perhaps, but gifted with admirable powers of lucid exposition. His commentator is based on that of Ts�ao Kung, whose terse sentences he contrives to expand and develop in masterly fashion. Without Chang Yu, it is safe to say that much of Ts�ao Kung�s commentary would have remained cloaked in its pristine obscurity and therefore valueless. His work is not mentioned in the Sung history, the T�UNG K�AO, or the YU HAI, but it finds a niche in the T�UNG CHIH, which also names him as the author of the "Lives of Famous Generals."45 It is rather remarkable that the last-named four should all have flourished within so short a space of time. Ch�ao Kung-wu accounts for it by saying: "During the early years of the Sung dynasty the Empire enjoyed a long spell of peace, and men ceased to practice the art of war. but when [Chao] Yuan-hao�s rebellion came [1038-42] and the frontier generals were defeated time after time, the Court made strenuous inquiry for men skilled in war, and military topics became the 44T�UNG K�AO, ch. 221. 45This appears to be still extant.

Hence it is that the commentators of Sun Tzu in our dynasty belong mainly to that period.46 Besides these eleven commentators,
