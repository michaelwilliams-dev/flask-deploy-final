the power to rise above the fierce resistances and animosities of those around him. That is the physics that all fearless types discover at some point�an appropriate ratcheting up of self-belief and energy when facing negative or even impossible circumstances. Fearless people do not emerge exclusively from poverty or a harsh physical environment. Franklin Delano Roosevelt grew up in a wealthy, privileged family. At the age of thirty-nine he contracted polio, which paralyzed him from the waist down. This was a turning point in his life, as he faced a severe limitation to his movement and possibly an end to his political career. He refused, however, to give in to the fear and the downward pull on his spirit. He went the opposite direction, struggling to make the most of his physical condition and developing an indomitable spirit that would transform him into our most fearless president. For this type of person, any kind of encounter with adversity or limitation, at any age, can serve as the crucible for forging the attitude.

We responded to this constrictive environment by overcoming our fears and developing what came to be known as a pioneer spirit�our sense of adventure and our renowned ability to solve problems. With our growing prosperity this began to change. In the twentieth century, however, one environment remained as harsh as ever�the black ghettos of inner-city America. And out of such a crucible a new fearless type came forward, exemplified by such figures as James Baldwin, Malcolm X, and Muhammad Ali. But the racism of the times constricted their ability to give full rein to this spirit. In recent times, newer types have emerged from inner-city America with more freedom to advance to the highest points of power in America� in entertainment, politics, and business. They come from a Wild West�like environment in which they have learned to fend for themselves and give full rein to their ambition. Their education comes from the streets and their own rough experiences. In a way, they are throwbacks to the freewheeling types of the nineteenth century, who had little formal schooling but created a new way of doing business. Their spirit fits the disorder of the twentyfirst century. They are fascinating to watch and in some ways have much to teach us. The rapper known as 50 Cent (aka Curtis Jackson) would have to be considered one of the more
