when he killed citizens, betrayed friends, walked without faith, without pi- ety,andwithout religion. Bythismeans, hecould achieve power butnotglory. Still, ifyouconsider Agatocle's virtue infacing and overcoming danger, andhisgreatness infacing andovercoming obstacles, there isnothing bywhich tojudge himworse than any good Captain. Despite hisextreme cruelty andinhumanity and hiswickedness, hestands among great-celebrated men. Butthis cannot beattributed either tofortune orvirtue. Without either, he reached hisgoal. Inourtimes, with Pope Alexander VIreigning, Oliverotto Uf- freducci ofFermo losthisfather atanearly ageandwasraised by amaternal uncle, Giovanni Pigliani. Atanearly agehealso joined thearmy under Paolo Vitelli androse toofficer. When Paolo died (decapitated forsuspected treason, 1499 —heserved intheFlorentine waragainst Pisa), Oliverotto fought forawhile with Vitellozzo, Paolo's brother. Inashort time, ingenious, dash- ing,andbrave, hebecame head ofthemilitia. Butservice with others seemed tohimdemeaning andhedecided, with thehelp of some citizens ofFermo who were more used toservitude than freedom, andwith thehelp ofVitellozzo, tooccupy Fermo. Hewrote hisuncle Giovanni Fogliani thatashehadbeen away from home many years hewould liketoreturn andseehim andhiscityandreclaim some ofhispatrimony. Hehadspent his time insearch ofhonor andhesaid, toshow hehadnotworked in vain, thathewanted torideinwith ahundred horses andservants andhehoped Fogliani would receive himwith honors. This said, Giovanni honored hisnephew. Oliverotto, well received, took up residence inhishouses. After afewdays, making hissecret and evilpreparations, heinvited Giovanni Fogliani andalltheprinci THE PRINCE —61 palmen ofFermo. After thebanquet and entertainments, Oliverotto expanded totheparty onthegreatness ofAlexander IVandhissonDesare andontheir enterprises. When Giovanni andtheothers began tomake comments, Oliverotto stood upand saidthatthey should discuss thematter ingreater privacy andre- tiretoanother room, where Giovanni andtheothers followed him. Assoon asthey were seated, thehidden soldiers entered, killed Giovanni, andmurdered therestofthem. After themassacre, Oliverotto mounted hishorse, rode to town, andbesieged thesupreme magistrate inhispalace. Outof fear, theyobeyed him, forming agovernment andmaking himthe chief. Everybody was dead who might have objected andnow civil andmartial laws were passed. Within ayear, Oliverotto was secure inFermo andasource ofintimidation toallhisneighbors. Itwould have been asdifficult toremove himasAgatocle except that hewas deceived byCesare Borgia, who atSinigaglia, as mentioned previously, captured theOrsini andVitelli, andwhere ayear after committing patricide, Oliverotto himself, along with Vitellozzo, amask ofvirtue andwickedness also, wasstrangled. One cancertainly question why Agatocle andsuch persons, after betraying everybody andexercising great cruelty, canlivea long lifesure athome andsafefrom external enemies, andwhy thecitizens don't conspire against them —whereas others almost ascruel have notbeen able tomaintain states even inpeaceful times andcertainly notintimes ofwar. Ibelieve thisisbecause ofthegood andbaduseofcruelty. Cruelty well used (ifonecan ever saycruelty isgood) iswhen itispracticed suddenly andde- cisively, butnotprolonged. Thepracticant converts topractices more useful forhissubjects. Cruelty badly used iswhen although slight atthebeginning, itgrows more widely used intime. Those who work thefirstwaycanrectify their state with God andwith men, asAgatocle did.Those who practice thesecond wayfail. Note thatintaking astate theoccupier hastoactquickly and commit theworst offenses right away, sothathedoesn't have to goonoffending everyday. This way, giving nomore offense, he canreassure andbenefit others. Who doesn't dothis, either outof 62—Niccolò Machiavelli timidity orbadadvice, always hastohave thedagger inhand. He can't count onanyone because noonecancount onhim. Offense hastobedone allatonce soastobeover andforgotten, while favors should bedealt outbitbybitslowly sothattheycanbesa- vored better. APrince hastolivewith hissubjects freetovary thegood andthebad. This isbecause inbadtimes hehasno room tomaneuver andhastoactharshly outofnecessity while when hedoes good, ifheissoconstrained, hegetsnocredit for what hedoes. 包包 OFTHE CIVIL
