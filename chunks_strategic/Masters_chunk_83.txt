whether it wants to or not, it will suddenly topple down. When that time comes, you could round up everyone you could find and pay them to hold the tree up, but they wouldn�t be able to do it. It would still come crashing to the ground�. But if the woodcutter stopped after one or two strokes of his axe to ask the third son of Mr. Chang, �Why doesn�t this tree fall?� And after three or four more strokes stopped again to ask the fourth son of Mr. Li, �Why doesn�t this tree fall?� he would never succeed in felling the tree. It is no different for someone who is practicing the Way. �ZEN MASTER HAKUIN III ABSORB THE MASTER�S POWER: THE MENTOR DYNAMIC Life is short, and your time for learning and creativity is limited. Without any guidance, you can waste valuable years trying to gain knowledge and practice from various sources. Instead, you must follow the example set by Masters throughout the ages and find the proper mentor. The mentor-prot�g� relationship is the most efficient and productive form of learning. The right mentors know where to focus your attention and how to challenge you. Their knowledge and experience become yours. They provide immediate and realistic feedback on your work, so you can improve more rapidly. Through an intense person-to.person interaction, you absorb a way of thinking that contains great power and can be adapted to your individual spirit.

His options were severely limited by his circumstances. His parents had ten children to feed and support. The father worked sporadically because of illness, and the family needed additional income. The parents waited anxiously for the day when young Faraday would turn twelve and could get a job, or begin some kind of apprenticeship. There was one trait, however, that marked him as different and was potentially troubling�he had an extremely active mind, one that was perhaps unsuited for a career that would entail mostly physical labor. Some of his mental restlessness was inspired by the peculiar religion his family belonged to�they were Sandemanians, a sect of Christianity. Its adherents believed that God�s presence was manifested in every living thing and every natural phenomenon.
