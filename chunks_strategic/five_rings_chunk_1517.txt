Candi— dates forthisposition traditionally made apublicaddress early inthe race, and when Coriolanus came before thepeople,hebegan bydisplaying the dozens ofscars hehad accumulated over seventeen years offighting for Rome. Few inthecrowd really heard thelengthy speech that followed; those scars, proof ofhisvalor andpatriotism, moved thepeopletotears. Coriola.nus’s election seemed certain. When thepolling day arrived, however, Coriolanus made anentry into theforum escorted bytheentire senate andbythecity’s patricians,the aristocracy. The common peoplewho saw this were disturbed bysuch a blusteringshow ofconfidence onelection day. And then Coriolanus spoke again, mostly addressingthewealthyciti- zens who hadaccompanied him. Hiswords were arrogantand insolent. Claimingcertain victoryinthevote, heboasted ofhisbattlefield exploits, made sourjokesthatappealed onlytothepatricians,voiced angryaccuser» tions against hisopponents, andspeculatedontheriches hewould bringto Rome. This time thepeople listened: Theyhad notrealized that thisleg- endary soldier was also acommon braggart. News ofCoriolanus’s second speech spread quickly through Rome, and thepeopleturned out ingreat numbers tomake sure he was not elected. Defeated, Coriolanus returned tothebattlefield, bitter andvowing revengeonthe common folk who hadvoted against him. Some weeks later alarge shipmentofgrain arrived inRome. The senate wasreadytodistrib~ utethisfood tothepeople,forfree, butjustastheywere preparingtovote onthequestion Coriolanus appearedonthe scene and took the senate floor. The distribution, heargued, would have a.harmful effect onthecity asawhole. Several senators appearedwon over, and thevote onthedistri- bution fellinto doubt.

Headvocated getting ridofthe people’s represen!atives—thetribunes-—-and turningover thegoverningof thecitytothepatricians. When word ofCoriolanus’s latest speech reached thepeople,their anger knew nobounds. The tribunes were sent tothe senate todemand that Coriolanusappearbefore them. Herefused. Riots broke outallover thecity. The senate, fearingthepeople’s wrath, finally voted infavor ofthe grain distribution. The tribunes were appeased,but thepeoplestilldo manded that Coriolanus speaktothem andapologize. Ifherepented, and agreedtokeephisopinionstohimself, hewould beallowed toreturn to thebattlefield. Coriolanus didappearone lasttime before thepeople, who listened to him inraptsilence. Hestarted slowly andsoftly,but asthespeechwent on, hebecame more and more blunt. Yetagainhehurled insults! His tone was arrogant,hisexpressiondisdainful. The more hespoke,theangtier the peoplebecame. Finally theyshouted him down and silenced him. The tribunes conferred, condemned Coriolanus todeath, and ordered themagistratestotake him atonce tothetopoftheTitrpeianrock and throw him over. The delighted crowd seconded thedecision. The patri- cians, however, managedtointervene, and the sentence was commuted to alifelong banishment. When thepeoplefound outthat Rome’s great mili- tary hero would never retum tothecity, they celebrated inthe streets. In fact no one had ever seen web acelebration, not even after thedefeat ofa foreign enemy. Interpretation Before hisentrance intopolitics,the name ofCoriolanus evoked awe. Hisbattlefield accomplishmentsshowed him asaman ofgreat brav- ery.Since thecitizens knew little about him, allkinds oflegendsbecame at- tached tohis name. The moment heappearedbefore theRoman citizens, however, andspokehismind, allthatgrandeur andmysteryvanished. He braggedand blustered like acommon soldier. Heinsulted and slandered people,asifhefeltthreatened and insecure. Suddenlyhe was not atall what thepeoplehadimagined.The discrepancybetween thelegend and thereality proved immensely disappointingtothose who wanted tobe lieve intheir hero. The more Coriolanus said, the lesspowerfulheap- peared——-a person who cannot control hiswords shows that hecannot control himself, and isunworthy ofrespect. Had Coriolanus said less, thepeoplewould never have had cause to beoffended byhim, would never have known histruefeelings.
