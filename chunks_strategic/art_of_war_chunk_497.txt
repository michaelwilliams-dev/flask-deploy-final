Then, again, there are places like salt deserts where provisions being unobtainable, supplies from home cannot be dispensed with."] As many as seven hundred thousand families will be impeded in their labor. [Mei Yao-ch�en says: "Men will be lacking at the plough- tail." The al- lusion is to the system of dividing land into nine parts, each consisting of about 15 acres, the plot in the center being cultivated on behalf of the State by the tenants of the other eight. It was here also, so Tu Mu tells us, that their cottages were built and a well sunk, to be used by all in common. [See II. ss. 12, note.] In time of war, one of the families had to serve in the army, while the other seven contributed to its support. Thus, by a levy of 100,000 men (reckoning one able- bodied soldier to each family) the husbandry of 700,000 families would be affected.] 121 CHAPTER 14. THE USE OF SPIES 122 2. Hostile armies may face each other for years, striving for the victory which is decided in a single day. This being so, to remain in ignorance of the enemy�s condition simply because one grudges the outlay of a hundred ounces of silver in honors and emoluments, ["For spies" is of course the meaning, though it would spoil the effect of this curiously elaborate exordium if spies were actually mentioned at this point.] is the height of inhumanity. [Sun Tzu�s agreement is certainly ingenious. He begins by adverting to the frightful misery and vast expenditure of blood and treasure which war al- ways brings in its train. Now, unless you are kept informed of the enemy�s condition, and are ready to strike at the right moment, a war may drag on for years. The only way to get this information is to employ spies, and it is impossible to obtain trustworthy spies unless they are properly paid for their services. But it is surely false economy to grudge a comparatively trifling amount for this purpose, when every day that the war lasts eats up an incalculably greater sum. This grievous burden falls on the shoulders of the poor, and hence Sun Tzu concludes that to neglect the use of spies is nothing less than a crime against humanity.] 3. One who acts thus is no leader of men, no present help to his sovereign, no master of victory. [This idea, that the true object of war is peace, has its root in the na- tional temperament of the Chinese. Even so far back as 597 B.C., these memorable words were uttered by Prince Chuang of the Ch�u State: "The [Chinese] character for �prowess� is made up of [the characters for] �to stay� and �a spear� (cessation of hostilities). Military prowess is seen in the repression of cruelty, the calling in of weapons, the preservation of the appointment of Heaven, the firm establishment of merit, the bestowal of happiness on the people, putting harmony between the princes,
