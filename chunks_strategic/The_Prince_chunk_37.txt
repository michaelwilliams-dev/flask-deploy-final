citizens became Princes. With the Church rising and some republics, things were headed by 78� Niccol� Machiavelli priests and citizens not accustomed to arms � and they began to use foreign troops. The first to resort to this sort of militia was of in Alberigo Conio, from Romagna, who founded 1409 the Company of St. George. From his example Braccio and Sforza followed, both their times arbiters of Italy. After them came in the others who into our times have commanded mercenary ar.mies. The outcome of this was the descent of Charles of France into Italy, Louis the XII, and Ferdinand of Aragon, all helped by the Swiss. Their tactic was to reduce the infantry. Without a state and in the business of war, the infantry burdened them and were hard to provide for. So they built up the cavalry which were less numer.ous but easier to support. Finally, in an army of 20,000 soldiers, two there were only thousand infantry. Everything was done to reduce the work and fears soldiers, not massacring each of the other but taking prisoners. They didn't assault cities at night and the cities did not launch surprise attacks on the tents. There was no campaigning in winter. All this was permitted in the military to escape burdens and hardships till finally the Italian military was weakened and vitiated. CONCERNING AUXILIARY, MIXED, AND NATIVE MILITIA A uxiliary arms, the other useless weapon, are when some-to to oneaid andcalls on another p Julius come with his forces defend you. Ppotentate II did this recently. Hav. ing seen the sad fate of his mercenaries at Ferrara, he turned to auxiliaries. He asked Ferdinand of Spain to help him with his personnel and armies. For their owners these forces can be useful and good, but for third parties they are almost always harmful. If they lose, you are defenseless; if they win, you are a prisoner. There are many examples of this in ancient history, but I don't want to forget the fresh example of Pope Julius II. At first, he made the bad call, wanting Ferrara, of throwing himself the in hands of a foreigner. But luck smiled on him from another quar.ter, and thus he escaped the fate of his bad choice. Namely, al.though his Spanish auxiliaries were broken at Ravenna, the Swiss came to his aid and chased the French so that he did not become prisoner of either his enemies or his auxiliaries. The Florentines, when they were disarmed, sent 10,000 French to Pisa, running a greater risk then at any time in their history. In 1353 the Emperor of Constantinople fielded 10,000 Turks against the Greeks who, when the war was over, didn't want to leave. Thus began the ser.vitude of the Greeks to the Infidel. Losers, therefore, rely on such arms � they are much more dangerous than mercenaries. Auxiliaries lead to sure ruin � they are united in obedience to others. Mercenaries, once victorious, if they want to offend you, need
