in opponents means knowing others. MEI YAOCHEN Hide your form, be orderly within, and watch for gaps and slack. Master Sun Invincibility is in oneself, vulnerability is in the opponent. DU MU Keeping your own military in order, always being prepared for opposition, erase your tracks and hide your form, making yourself inscrutable to opponents. When you see that an opponent can be taken advantage of, then you emerge to attack. WANG XI Invincibility is a matter of self-defense; vulnerability is simply a matter of having gaps. Master Sun Therefore skillful warriors are able to be invincible, but they cannot cause opponents to be vulnerable. DU MU If opponents have no formation to find out, no gap or slack to take advantage of, how can you overcome them even if you are well equipped?

When you know that an opponent is vulnerable, then you attack the heart and take it. WANG XI Those on the defensive are so because they do not have enough to win; those on the offense are so because they have more than enough to win. Master Sun Defense is for times of insufficiency, attack is for times of surplus. LI QUAN Those whose strength is insufficient should defend, those whose strength is superabundant can attack.
