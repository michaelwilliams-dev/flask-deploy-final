Cosimo finallydied in1464, after rulingforyears.The citizens ofFlorence wanted tobuild him agreat tomb, and tocelebrate hismemory with elaborate funeral ceremonies, but onhisdeathbed hehad asked tobe buried without “any pompordemonstration.” Some sixty years later, Machiavelli hailed Cosimo asthewisest ofallprinces, “for heknew how extraordinary thingsthat are seen andappear every hour make men much more envied than those that aredone indeed and arecovered over with decency.” Interpretation Aclose friend ofCosimo’s, thebookseller VespasianodaBisticci, once wrote ofhim, “And whenever hewished toachieve something,hesaw toit, inorder toescape envyasmuch aspossible,that theinitiative appearedto come from others, and notfrom h.1'.m.” One ofCosirno’s favoriteexpres- sions was,“Envyisaweed that should notbewatered.” Understandingthe power envy hasinademocratic environment, Cosimo avoided theappear- ance ofgreatness.This does not mean that greatness should besuffocated, orthatonly themediocre should survive; onlythat agame ofappearances must beplayed.
