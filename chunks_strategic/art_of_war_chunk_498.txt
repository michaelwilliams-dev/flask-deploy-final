the diffu- sion of wealth."] 4. Thus, what enables the wise sovereign and the good general to strike and conquer, and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men, is FORE- KNOWLEDGE. [That is, knowledge of the enemy�s dispositions, and what he means to do.] 5. Now this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits; it cannot be ob- tained inductively from experience, [Tu Mu�s note is: "[knowledge of the enemy] cannot be gained by reason- ing from other analogous cases."] CHAPTER 14. THE USE OF SPIES 123 nor by any deductive calculation. [Li Ch�uan says: "Quantities like length, breadth, distance and magnitude, are susceptible of exact mathematical determination; human actions can- not be so calculated."] 6. Knowledge of the enemy�s dispositions can only be obtained from other men. [Mei Yao-ch�en has rather an interesting note: "Knowledge of the spirit- world is to be obtained by divination; information in natural science may be sought by inductive reasoning; the laws of the universe can be verified by mathematical calculation: but the dispositions of an enemy are ascer- tainable through spies and spies alone."] 7. Hence the use of spies, of whom there are five classes: (1) Local spies; (2) inward spies; (3) converted spies; (4) doomed spies; (5) surviving spies. 8. When these five kinds of spy are all at work, none can discover the secret system. This is called "divine manipulation of the threads." It is the sover- eign�s most precious faculty. [Cromwell, one of the greatest and most practical of all cavalry leaders, had officers styled �scout masters,� whose business it was to collect all possible information regarding the enemy, through scouts and spies, etc., and much of his success in war was traceable to the previous knowledge of the enemy�s moves thus gained." 1 ] 9. Having LOCAL SPIES means employing the services of the inhabitants of a district. [Tu Mu says: "In the enemy�s country, win people over by kind treatment, and use them as spies."] 10. Having INWARD SPIES, making use of officials of the enemy. [Tu Mu enumerates the following classes as likely to do good service in this respect: "Worthy men who have been degraded from office, crimin- als who have undergone punishment; also, favorite concubines who are greedy for gold, men who are aggrieved at being in subordinate positions, 1"Aids to Scouting," p. 2. CHAPTER 14. THE USE OF SPIES 124 or who have been passed over in the distribution of posts, others who are anxious that their side should be defeated in order that they may have a chance of displaying their ability and talents, fickle turncoats who al- ways want to have a foot in each boat. Officials of these several kinds," he continues, "should be secretly approached and bound to one�s interests by means of rich presents. In this way you will be able to find out the state of affairs in the enemy�s country, ascertain the plans that are being formed against you, and moreover disturb the harmony and create
