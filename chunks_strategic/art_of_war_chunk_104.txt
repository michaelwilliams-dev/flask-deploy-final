moment, a war may drag on for years. The only way to get this information is to employ spies, and it is impossible to obtain trustworthy spies unless they are properly paid for their services. But it is surely false economy to grudge a comparatively trifling amount for this purpose, when every day that the war lasts eats up an incalculably greater sum. This grievous burden falls on the shoulders of the poor, and hence Sun Tzu concludes that to neglect the use of spies is nothing less than a crime against humanity.] 3. One who acts thus is no leader of men, no present help to his sovereign, no master of victory. [This idea, that the true object of war is peace, has its root in the na- tional temperament of the Chinese. Even so far back as 597 B.C., these memorable words were uttered by Prince Chuang of the Ch�u State: "The [Chinese] character for �prowess� is made up of [the characters for] �to stay� and �a spear� (cessation of hostilities). Military prowess is seen in the repression of cruelty, the calling in of weapons, the preservation of the appointment of Heaven, the firm establishment of merit, the bestowal of happiness on the people, putting harmony between the princes, the diffu- sion of wealth."] 4. Thus, what enables the wise sovereign and the good general to strike and conquer, and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men, is FORE- KNOWLEDGE. [That is, knowledge of the enemy�s dispositions, and what he means to do.] 5. Now this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits; it cannot be ob- tained inductively from experience, [Tu Mu�s note is: "[knowledge of the enemy] cannot be gained by reason- ing from other analogous cases."] CHAPTER 14. THE USE OF SPIES 123 nor by any deductive calculation. [Li Ch�uan says: "Quantities like length, breadth, distance and magnitude, are susceptible of exact mathematical determination; human actions can- not be so calculated."] 6. Knowledge of the enemy�s dispositions can only be obtained from other men. [Mei Yao-ch�en has rather an interesting note: "Knowledge of the spirit- world is to be obtained by divination; information in natural science may be sought by inductive reasoning; the laws of the universe can be verified by mathematical calculation: but the dispositions of an enemy are ascer- tainable through spies and spies alone."] 7. Hence the use of spies, of whom there are five classes: (1) Local spies; (2) inward spies; (3) converted spies; (4) doomed spies; (5) surviving spies. 8. When these five kinds of spy are all at work, none can discover the secret system. This is called "divine manipulation of the threads." It is the sover- eign�s most precious faculty. [Cromwell, one of the greatest and most practical of all cavalry leaders, had officers styled �scout masters,� whose business it was to collect all possible information regarding the enemy, through scouts and spies, etc., and much of his success in war was traceable to the previous knowledge of
