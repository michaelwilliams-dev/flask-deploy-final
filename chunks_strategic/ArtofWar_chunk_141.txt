of the terrain, then you can discern whether to do battle or disperse. Master Sun Leadership is a matter of intelligence, trustworthiness, humaneness, courage, and sternness. CAO CAO A general should have these five virtues. DU MU The Way of the ancient kings was to consider humaneness foremost, while the martial artists considered intelligence foremost. This is because intelligence involves ability to plan and to know when to change effectively. Trustworthiness means to make people sure of punishment or reward. Humaneness means love and compassion for people, being aware of their toils. Courage means to seize opportunities to make certain of victory, without vacillation. Sternness means to establish discipline in the ranks by strict punishments. JIA LIN Reliance on intelligence alone results in rebelliousness. Exercise of humaneness alone results in weakness.

Whose system of rewards and punishment is clearer? This is how you can know who will win. LI QUAN A political leadership that has the Way will surely have a military leadership that has intelligence and ability. DU MU Ask yourself which political leadership�your own or that of your enemy�is able to reject flatterers and draw close to the wise. DU YOU The Way means virtue. It is first necessary to compare the political leadership of nations at war. MEI YAOCHEN The question regarding political leadership is, who is able to win the hearts of the people. HO YANXI The ancient classic of documents says, �The one who treats me well is my leader, the one who treats me cruelly is my enemy.� The question is, which side has a humane government, and which side has a cruel government. ZHANG YU First compare the political leadership of the two nations at war, in terms of which one has the Way of benevolence and good faith. Then examine the military leadership�who has intelligence, trustworthiness, humaneness, bravery, and sternness. Now observe which side has the environmental
