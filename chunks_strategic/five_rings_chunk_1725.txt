youaresurrounded bypeoplewho have absolutely noreason tohelp youunless itisintheir interest todo so.Andifyouhave nothingtooffer their selfiinterest, youarelikelytomake them hostile, for they will seeinyoujustone more competitor,one more waster oftheir time. Those that overcome thisprevailingcoldness arethe ones who find thekeythat unlocks thestra.nger’s head andmind, seducing him into their corner, ifnecessary sofiening him upfor apunch.But mostpeoplenever learn this side ofthegame. Vlrhen theymeet someone new, rather than steppingback andprobing toseewhat makes thisperson unique, theytalk about themselves, eagertoimposetheir own willpowerandprejudices. They argue, boast, and make ashow oftheirpower. They maynotknow it buttheyaresecretly creatinganenemy,aresistor, because there isno more infuriating feeling than having your individuality ignored, yourown psychology unacknowledged. Itmakesyoufeel lifeless and resentful. Remember: Thekeytopersuasionissoftening people upand break- ingthem down, gently.Seduce them with atwo—pronged approach:Work ontheir emotions andplayontheir intellectual weaknesses. Bealert to both whatseparatesthem from everyone else(their individual psychology) and what theyshare witheveryoneelse(their basic emotional responses). Aim attheprimary emotions——love, hate, jealousy.Onceyoumove their emotionsyouhave reduced their control, makingthem more vulnerable to persuasion. When Chuko Liang wanted todissuade animportant generalofarival kingdom from entering into analliance with Ts’ao Ts’ao, Liang’sdreaded enemy,hedid not detail "rm; Ts’ao’s cruelty,orattack him onmoral grounds. Instead Liang suggested that Ts’ao Ts’ao wasreallyafter thegen» eral’s beautifulyoungwife. This hitthegeneralinthegut, and won him over. MaoTse—tung similarly always appealedtopopular emotions, and spokeinthesimplestterms. Educated and well—rea.d himself, inhis speechesheused visceral metaphors, voicing thepublic’s deepestamdelies andencouraging them tovent their frustrations inpublic meetings.Rather than arguingthepractical aspects of a.particular program, hewould de~ scribe how itwould affect them onthemost primitive,down—to—earth level. Donotbelieve that thisapproachworks onlywith theilliterate and un- sch0oled—it works onone and all.Allofusaremortal and face the same dreadful fate, and allofusshare thedesire forattachment andbelonging. Stirupthese emotions andyoucaptivateourhearts. The best waytodothis iswith adramatic jolt, ofthekind that Chuko Liangcreated when befedand released prisonerswho expected onlythe worst from him. Shaking them tothecore, hesoftened their hearts. Playon contrasts like this: Push peopletodespair,then givethem relief. Iftheyex~ pectpainandyougivethem pleasure, youwintheir hearts. Creating plea- sure ofanykind, infact, willusually bring you success, aswillallaying fears andprovidingorpromising security. Symbolic gesturesareoften enough towinsympathyandgoodwill. A gesture ofself—sacri.fice, forexample--ashow that yousuffer asthose around youdo—will make people identify with you,even ifyour suffering issymbolicorminor and theirs isreal. When youenter agroup,make a gestureofgoodwill;soften thegroup upfortheharsher actions thatwillfol- low later. When T.E.Lawrence wasfightingtheTurks inthedeserts oftheMid- dleEast duringWorld War I,hehad anepiphany:Itseemed tohim that Conventional warfare had lost itsvalue. The old-fashioned soldier was lost inthe enormous amiies ofthetime, inwhich hewas ordered about like a lifelesspawn.Lawrence wanted toturn this around. Forhim, everysol- dier’s mind was akingdom hehad toconquer. Acommitted, psychologi- cally motivated soldier would fight harder and morecreativelythan a. puppet. Lawrence’s perceptionisstill more true intheworldtoday,where so many ofusfeelalienated, anonymous,andsuspiciousofauthority,allof which makes overtpower playsand force even more counterproductive anddangerous.Instead ofmanipulatinglifelesspawns,make those onyour side convinced and excited bythe causeyouhave enlisted them in;this will notonlymakeyour work easier butitwill alsogive youmore leeway todeceive them later on.And toaccomplishthisyouneed todeal with their individual psychologies.Never clumsilyassume that the tactic that worked on oneperson willnecessarilywork onanother. Tofind thekey thatwill motivate them, firstgetthem toopen up.The more they talk, the more theyreveal about their likes and dislikes--the handles and levers to move them with. The quickest waytosecure people’sminds isbydemonstrating,as simplyaspossible,how anaction will benefit them. Self—interest isthe LAW 43‘3'73
