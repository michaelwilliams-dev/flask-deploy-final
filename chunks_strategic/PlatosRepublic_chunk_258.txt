eviJ assigned to the destruction of something e]se wi11 hard]y destroy a sou], or anything e]se except that to which it is assigned." "Yes, hard]y," he said, "at ]east as is Jike]y." "Therefore, since it's not destroyed by a sing]e evi1-either its own or an a1ien-it's p]ain]y necessary that it be a]ways and, if it is a]? ways, that it be immortaL" "That is necessary," he said. "Wen, then," I said, "Jet this be so. And if it is, you recognize that there wou]d a]ways be the same sou]s. For sure]y they cou]d not be? come fewer if none is destroyed, nor again more numerous. For if any of the immorta] things shou]d become more numerous, you know that they wou]d come from the morta], and everything wou]d end up by being immortaL" "What you say is true." "But," I said, "Jet's not suppose this-for the argument won't per? mit it-nor that sou] by its truest nature is such that it is fun of much variety, dissimiJarity, and quarre] with itse]f." "How do you mean?" he said. "It's not easy," I said, "for a thing to be etema] that is both com- posed out of many things and whose composition isï¿½ not of the finest, as the soul now looked to us." "No; at least it's not likely." "Well then, that soul is immortal both the recent argument and the others would compel us to accept. But it must be seen such as it is in truth, not maimed by community with body and other evils, as we now see it. But what it is like when it has become pure must be exam? ined sufficiently by calculation. And one will find it far fairer and discern justice and injustice8 and everything we have now gone through more distinctly. Now we were telling the truth about it as it looks at present. However that is based only on the condition in which we saw it. Just as those who catch sight of the sea Glaucus9 would no longer easily see his original nature because some of the old parts of his body have been broken off and the others have been ground down and thoroughly maimed by the waves at the same time as other things have grown on him-shells, seaweed, and rocks-so that he resembles any beast rather than what he was by nature, so, too, we see the soul in such a condition because of countless evils. But, Glaucon, one must look elsewhere." "Where?" he said. "To its love of wisdom, and recognize what it lays hold of and with what sort of things it longs to keep company on the grounds that it is akin to the divine and immortal and what is always, aBd what it would become like if it were to give itself entirely to this longing and were brought by this impulse out of the deep ocean in which it now is, and the rocks and shells were hammered off-those which, because it
