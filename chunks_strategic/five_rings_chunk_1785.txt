the Florentine republic atthe height of her power and prosperity under the sway ofLorenzo the Magnifi- cent ,and for the time being Italy was enjoying ashort period of comparative peace ,largely due toLorenzo's diplomatic influ- ence ;but such tranquility could not be expected tolast ,and on Lorenzo's death in1492 ,Italy quickly relapsed into her former state ofchaos ,which was won tobe aggravated byaseries ofin- vasions byher more warlike northern neighbors .In1594 Charles VIII ofFrance made his irruption into Italy tomake good his claim toNaples against the House ofAragon ,and sohelpless was the country todefend herself against attack ,that hewas able to march from the north through Florence and Rome toNaples ,to THE PRINCE —17 take possession ofthatkingdom, andtoreturn toFrance bythe same route, without once meting anyserious opposition. From thattime onwards, throughout Machiavelli’s life,Italy was sel- dom entirely freefrom theinvasions ofoneforeign army oran- other, andthere followed aperiod ofbewildering confusion dur- ingwhich theEmperor, theFrench, theSwiss, andtheSpaniards, thePope andthemore powerful Italian states were allatwarand allalternately enemies andallies ofeach other, while every part ofItaly suffered inturnfrom thedesolation ofthecountry andthe brutalities oftheforeign soldiery. Such were thechaotic conditions which prevailed inItaly in Machiavelli’s day, and which stirred him tosearch forsome means ofrestoring hisunhappy country toamore peaceful state. OnthefalloftheMedici in1494 Florence reverted totruerepub- lican government, andafewyears later Machiavelli obtained a position ofconsiderable importance, being appointed Chancellor andSecretary tothedepartment ofthe‘Dìeci diLibertà ePace,’ a post which heretained forfourteen years. While holding thispo- sition hewas entrusted with anumber ofdiplomatic missions (through henever attained therank ofanambassador), andal- though hisefforts were bynomeans invariably crowned with success, heacquired agreat reputation forthesubtlety ofhisob- servations andtheskill with which hedivined theintentions of those towhom hewasaccredited. OnthefalloftheRepublic andthereturn oftheMedici in 1512, Machiavelli losthisofficial position, andinspite ofallhis efforts hewasnever able toobtain anypermanent employment under thenew rulers. Heretired tohisvilla atSanCasciano, and devoted histime totheliterary works, which arehisgreat titleto fame. Now Machiavelli wasabove allapatriot, firstasaFlorentine, andsecondly asanItalian. Hewasprofoundly impressed byIt- aly’s miserable condition, andhisactive mind hadlong been oc- cupied ininquiring intotherootcauses ofhermisfortunes andin searching fortheappropriate remedy. Partly astheresult ofhis study ofancient history andpartly from hisacute observation of 18—Niccolò Machiavelli themethods employed bysuccessful rulers ofhisown day, Ma- chiavelli ultimately arrived atcertain definite conclusions asto what might bedone tocope with thechaos andmisery thathe sawonevery side. Hewas convinced thattheonly hope forItaly was thatthe whole country should beunited intoasingle state, with astable central government tomaintain internal order, andwith anational army ofsufficient strength todrive outandkeep outallthefor- eign invaders —French, German, Swiss andSpanish. Hisview wasthattheItalian states, with their mutual jealousy andrivalry, would never beable tocombine intoanyform ofpermanent fed- eration ofthemselves, andthattheir unity would have tobeim- posed onthem bysome overpowering authority. Having re- marked theease with which themore successful tyrants had carved outstates forthemselves inthepast, heconceived thebold idea that, ifthere wasindeed anywayofforcing anunwilling It- alyinto unity, itcould only bebythecompulsion ofasuper- tyrant who would conquer every state inturn andsubject the whole country tohisown absolute domination. Forthepurpose offreeing Italy from thedisturbance offor- eign invaders, heconsidered itessential that one ofthecon- queror’s first cares should betocreate alocal militia orcitizen army ineach state asheconquered it,sothatultimately there would besopowerful anational army thatnoforeigner would
