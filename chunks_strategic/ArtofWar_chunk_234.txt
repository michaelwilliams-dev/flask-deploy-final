with those who deserve to be executed. Pleasure should not induce you to forgive those who have done wrong; displeasure should not induce you to execute the innocent. Pleasure and displeasure should not be arbitrary; personal prejudices ignore worthy people. A general should not start a battle out of personal displeasure; it is imperative to go by the collective will. If he does go into battle because of personal displeasure, it will certainly result in defeat. Culture and the Military Culture takes precedence; the military comes after. If you put victory first, you will surely get beaten later; if you start out with anger, you will surely regret it later. One day�s anger can destroy your whole life. Therefore a superior man is stern but not ferocious: he may get angry, but not furious; he may worry, but does not fear; he may rejoice, but is not overjoyed. Organization A policy to quell disorder involves minimizing offices and combining duties, getting rid of embellishment in favor of substance. First organize directives, then organize penalties. First organize the near at hand, then organize the far removed. First organize the inner, then organize the outer. First organize the basic, then organize the derivative. First organize the strong, then organize the weak. First organize the great, then organize the small. First organize yourself, then organize others. Instruction and Direction A policy of instruction and direction means those above educate those below, not saying anything that is unlawful and not doing anything that is immoral, for what is done by those above is observed by those below. To indulge oneself yet instruct others is contrary to proper government; to correct oneself and then teach others is in accord with proper government. Therefore true leaders first rectify themselves and only after that do they promulgate their directives. If they are not upright themselves, their directives will not be followed, resulting in disorder. Therefore the Way of leadership puts education and direction before punishment. To send people to war without education is tantamount to throwing them away. Thought and Consideration A policy of thought and consideration means giving thought to what is near at hand and considering what is remote. As it is said, �If people do not consider what is remote, they will have trouble near at hand.� Therefore �educated people think without leaving their positions.� Thinking means correct strategy, consideration means thinking of plans for eventualities. One is not to plan policy when it is not one�s place to do so, or consider the scheme of things that are none of one�s business. Major affairs arise in difficulty, minor affairs arise in ease. Therefore if you want to think of the advantages in a situation, it is imperative to consider the harm; if you want to think about success, it is imperative to consider failure. Danger arises in safety, destruction arises in survival. Harm arises in advantage, chaos arises in order. Enlightened people know the obvious when they see the subtle, know the end
