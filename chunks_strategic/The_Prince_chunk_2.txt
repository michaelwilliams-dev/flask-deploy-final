he is playing? Is his description of human nature so stark that we cannot accept it for what it is? Or, is Machiavelli wrong in his observations? The problem is that we secretly believe that what he says is right but will not admit to it. As a result, we ascribe to him those negatives attributes and blame him for being its messenger! The strange thing is that while we may learn from his science, we our deny him entrance through front door but keep a path open for him to come in through the back door. And herein lies 8-Niccol� Machiavelli When he suggests guiding principles for a Prince concerning his land and people , the principles are not anchored in Machia.velli , the man, but in Machiavelli, the scientist, the cool observer of human nature . Because those principles are revealed through his science , we should judge him by the science he's discovered and not by the truths discovered through that science , because too often those truths are not to our liking. Like other creatures , humans are initially driven by an all-encompassing instinct -hunger. Although other creatures are destined to go from one meal to another, never knowing the whereabouts of the next meal , the human being has designed schemes to assure the next meal . The problem is that because he is not satisfied with what he has , he will fight to his death to increase his cache , thus denying it to others Unlike other creatures , however, humans are secondly driven by another all -encompassing instinct �-power. He has to have sway over other human beings ; he has to dominate them because the other choice would be to be domi. nated . Fortunately, the alpha instinct in man is diluted when he seeks fulfillment in other fields of human endeavor. When it comes to tyrants , however, Machiavelli knows too well that their first actions are aimed to satisfy their instincts at the expense of their fellow human beings . Virtue, then, needs to be discussed in terms of Machiavelli , the scientist. Is virtue desirable in leaders , be they student repre.sentatives , managers , appointed justices , ministers , popes or elected presidents ? And , is there a higher or lower degree of vir.tue when using certain means to accomplish certain ends ? If a general's mission is to occupy a territory, how he uses the means to achieve the end must come under scrutiny. If the means with which he achieves the end were entirely within established parameters , we would say that he is virtuous and has wisdom . But if, in accomplishing the same mission, he causes people to be killed unnecessarily, or that he does it for his personal glory and THE PRINCE � 9 aggrandizement, then we would not ascribe him any virtue and would condemn him for lacking in wisdom. What if he broadcasts lies as a means to confuse
