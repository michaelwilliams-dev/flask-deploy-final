insist on employing me for this mission, I will need six hundred thousand men.� This time the emperor agreed. When the men of Chu heard of this, they mobilized all of their armed forces to resist the Qin army under General Wang. General Wang, however, just strengthened his fortifications and did not do battle. He gave his soldiers plenty of rest every day, allowing them to bathe and wash their clothing. He also fed them well and generally provided for their comfort, sharing in their lot. After quite a while of this, General Wang asked if the soldiers were playing sports in camp. When he heard that they were, he declared, �Now they are fit for action!� The men of Chu, unable to oppose the Qin army in battle, withdrew to the east. General Wang pursued them and struck them down, killing their leader and putting the soldiers of Chu to flight, achieving a settlement by military means. THE LOST ART OF WAR SUN TZU II INTRODUCTION Few things might seem as unlikely as ancient Chinese warriors rising up in modern American business schools, corporate boardrooms, and Hollywood movies, but there they are. The rise of the new China, the power of the global marketplace, the intensification of international competition and rivalry�all of these elements of contemporary affairs may contribute in some way to present-day interest in ancient classics of strategy and conflict management. This literature, however, may have yet another function�perhaps not as apparent, but no less important than what emerges from its use in business, diplomacy, and warfare. While the study and application of strategic thinking in these areas may be necessary to secure the economic, political, and territorial underpinnings of democracy, these cannot guarantee freedom unless individuals and peoples have the right and the opportunity to recognize and understand all of the operative influences in their lives and on their minds�not only those that happen to be, or are made to appear, most evident to everyday awareness. Only thus is true freedom of choice possible in a real, practical sense. One of the most important functions of strategic literature in the public domain today, therefore, may be to enhance the general understanding of power and its uses and abuses. By understanding power�how configurations of power work, how masses of people are influenced, how individuals and peoples become vulnerable to internal contradictions and external aggression�it is possible to objectively and truthfully assess the operation of the world we live in �and, we might hope, to learn to avoid the abuses of power to which the massive, impersonal infrastructures of modern life are inherently prone. The most famous of ancient Chinese strategic manuals is The Art of War by Sun Tzu, an outstanding military consultant of China�s Warring States era. Somewhat more than a hundred years later, a lineal descendant of this Sun Tzu, or �Master Sun,� also rose to prominence as a distinguished strategist. This was Sun Bin, whose name means Sun the Mutilated. He became Sun Tzu
