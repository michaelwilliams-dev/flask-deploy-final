has been devoted to geometry and the one who has not." "Yes, by Zeus," he said, "the difference is complete." "Then, shall we set this down as the second study for the young?" ''Yes," he said, "we shall set it down." "And what about this? Shall we set astronomy down as the third? Or doesn't it seem to be the thing?" "It does, at least to me," he said. "A better awareness of seasons, months and years is suitab]e not on]y for farming and navigation, but no less so for generalship." "You are amusing," I said. "You are like a man who is afraid of the many in your not wanting to seem to command useless studies. It's scarcely an ordinary thing, rather it's hard, to trust that in these studies a certain instrument of everyone's soul-one that is destroyed and blinded by other practices-is purified and rekindled, an instrument more important to save than ten thousand eyes. For with it alone is truth seen. To those who share your opinion about this, what you say will seem indescribably good, while all those who have had no awareness at all of it can be expected to believe you are talking non? sense. They see no other benefit from these studies worth mentioning. Consider right here with which of these two kinds of men you are discussing. Or are you making the arguments for neither but chiefly for your own sake, without, however, grudging anyone else who might be able to get some profit from them?" "I choose the latter," he said, "to speak and ask and answer mostly for my own sake." "Well, then," I said, "retreat a way.14 What we took up as following geometry just now wasn't right." "Where was the mistake?" he said. "After a plane surface," I said, "we went ahead and took a solid in motion before taking it up by itself. But the right way is to take up the third dimension15 next in order after the second, and this is surely the dimension of cubes and what participates in depth." "Yes, it is," he said. "But, Socrates, it doesn't seem to have been discovered yet."16 "Of that," I said, "there are two causes. Because no city holds it in honor, it is feebly sought due to its difficulty. An9 those who seek for it need a supervisor, without whom they would not find it. And, in the first place, he's hard to come by; and then, even when he's there, as things stand he wouldn't be obeyed by those given to seeking it because of their high opinion of themselves. But if a whole city should join in supervising it and take the lead in honoring it, these men would obey; and, with it being continuously and eagerly sought for, its character would come to light; for even now, although it is despised and cut short by the many, and by those who seek it, since they have no account toï¿½ 527 C
