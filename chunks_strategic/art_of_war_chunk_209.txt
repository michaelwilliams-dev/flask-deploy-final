social idealist Cheng Yi� when warriors for good want to take their stand on ground where they cannot lose, they can do so only by living on what they have earned according to their means and by being in control of themselves. This sort of parallelism of principle in different realms is characteristic of literature derived from or influenced by Taoist and Buddhist schools; and it is no doubt a factor in the perennial popularity of works such as the I Ching and The Art of War beyond their original contexts. The I Ching�s reading for the third element of �Contention� also says, �Danger ends up all right.� Cheng Yi explains, �Though you be in danger, if you know how to be wary, you will have good luck in the end.� The word for danger, another standard I Ching term, also means �strict,� �intense,� and �diligent,� encompassing reference to both problem and solution in one symbol, in accord with the I Ching principle of �using unfortunate events for good purposes,� such as using stressful situations to arouse the willpower to overcome obstacles. The Art of War, in �Nine Grounds,� says, �If they are to die there, what can they not do? Warriors exert their full strength. When warriors are in great danger, then they have no fear.� The final saying of the I Ching statement on the third element of �Contention� is, �If you work for the king, you will not accomplish anything.� Cheng Yi interprets this to mean that people like those represented by this component should not arrogate to themselves the accomplishments that take place through participation in an existing system or a public forum. In this sense they need to recognize that they are �living on the past virtues� of many other people, and therefore not contend for special prominence or distinction simply on account of having done their work. Echoing this principle of unobtrusive action and unassuming service, in the chapter on �Formation� The Art of War says, �In ancient times those known as good warriors prevailed when it was easy to prevail. Therefore the victories of good warriors are not noted for cleverness or bravery.� This is also characteristic of Taoist philosophy; while undramatic, the indicated approach is held forth as a way to success: the Tao Te Ching says, �Plan for difficulty when it is still easy, do the great when it is still small.� The Art of War continues its description of the unassuming warriors of old by saying, �Therefore their victories in battle are not flukes. Their victories are not flukes because they position themselves where they will surely win, prevailing over those who have already lost.� They take advantage of the structure and momentum in situations, so they do not seem to be doing anything themselves; this is one aspect of the Taoist �nondoing that does everything.� The fourth element of the �Contention� hexagram represents people with personal power at the bottom of the upper echelons. These are people within the
