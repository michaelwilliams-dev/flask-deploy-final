of of be. cause men must take the ways trodden by others and imi.tate them even if they cannot succeed fully nor add much to the virtue of others. Even so a prudent man will always follow the path beaten by the great and those worth imitating so that, though he himself amount to not much, he will at least have the odor of fame and like the careful archers who, knowing the target is too far, and knowing how far their arrow will shoot, aim higher than their target not to achieve a loftier arc but by aiming high to hit their mark. I say that in new Principalities where the Prince is new one has more or less difficulty according to how virtuous the con.queror is. Success in becoming a new Prince presupposes either virtue or fortune and both of these mitigate some of the difficul.ties. However, he who owes less to fortune has an easier time. It is even easier if the Prince holds no other states and comes to live in the new one. To mention those who succeeded more by virtue than by for.tune in becoming Princes I should name Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, Theseus, and others of the same class. In talking about Moses one should note that he was merely the executor of things ordained by God, although he should be admired for the grace that allowed him to talk with God. But let us consider Cyrus and others who acquired or founded realms. They are all admirable. And consid.ering their actions they all differ little from Moses, who had such a great protector. Examining their lives one sees that all they had beside fortune was opportunity, which gave them stuff work to suited to their cause. Without opportunity, their virtue would 48� Niccol� Machiavelli have failed and without opportunity, their fortune would have been in vain. Therefore, it was necessary for Moses to find the people of Is-in in rael Egypt oppressed and ready fleeing slavery to follow him. It helped Romulus being trapped in Alba and exposed at birth to become King Rome and founder that Empire. It of of helped Cyrus to find the Persians discontented under the Medes who were soft and effeminate from a long period of peace. The.seus could not have shown his virtue had Athens not been dis.united. Opportunity made these men, and their virtue dominated the opportunity, making their homelands noble and happy. Those whose virtues, similar to these, overcome hardship in winning Principalities have an easier time keeping them. The dif.ficulties arise partly in winning the Principality from having to establish new rules and orders that they are forced to introduce to gain a foothold and win their security. One should realize that there nothing more difficult, more dubious success, nor is of more dangerous, than being a leader who introduces new ways of doing things. Such a leader immediately has for enemies all those whom the old ways benefit, while those who get the
