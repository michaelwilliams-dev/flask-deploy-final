"That's entirely certain," he said. 495a b C d e 496 a . -- [ 175] SOCRATES/ADEi MANTUS THE �i REPUBLIC 496 a b C d e 497 a b "Then it's a very small group, Adeimantus," I said, "which re? mains to keep company with philosophy in a way that's worthy; perhaps either a noble and well-reared disposition, held in check by ex? ile, remains by her side consistent with nature, for want of corruptors� or when a great soul grows up in a little city, despises the business of the city and looks out beyond; and; perhaps, a very few men from another art, who justly despise it because they have good natures, might come to her. And the bridle of our comrade Theages might be such as to restrain him. For in Theages' case all the other conditions for an ex? ile from philosophy were present, but the sickliness17 of his body, shutting him out of politics, restrains him. My case--the demonicls sign-isn't worth mentioning, for it has perhaps occurred in some one other man, or no other, before. Now the men who have become mem? bers of this small band have tasted how sweet and blessed a possession it is. At the same time, they have seen sufficiently the madness of the many, and that no one who minds the business of the cities does virtually anything sound, and that there is no ally with whom one could go to the aid of justice and be preserved. Rather-just like a human being who has fallen in with wild beasts and is neither willing to join them in doing injustice nor sufficient as one man to resist all the savage animals---one would perish before he has been of any use to city or friends and be of no profit to himself or others. Taking all this into the calculation, he keeps quiet and minds his own business-as a man in a storm, when dust and rain are blown about by the wind, stands aside under a little wall. Seeing others filled full of lawlessness, he is content if somehow he himself can live his life here pure of injustice and unholy deeds, and take his leave from it graciously and cheerfully with fair hope." "Well," he said, "he would leave having accomplished not the least of things." "But not the greatest either," I said, "if he didn't chance upon a suitable regime. For in a suitable one he himself will grow more and save the common things along with the private. "Now the reasons why philosophy is slandered, and that it isn't just that it be, have in my opinion been sensibly stated, unless you still have something else to say." "I have nothing further to say about this," he said. "But which of the current regimes do you say is suitable for it?" "None at all," I said, "but this is the very charge I'm bringing; not one city today is
