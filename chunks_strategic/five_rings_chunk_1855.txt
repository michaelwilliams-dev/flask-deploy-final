"So,carpenters, smiths, andmany other craftsmen ofthissortbe- come partners inour little city,making itinto athrong." "Most certainly." "But itwouldn't beverybigyet, ifweadded cowherds, shepherds, andtheother kinds ofherdsmen, sothatthefarmers would haveoxen forplowing, thehousebuilders teams tousewith thefarmers for e hauling, andtheweavers andcobblers hides andwool." "Norwould itbealittle city," hesaid,"when ithas allthis." "And, further," Isaid, "just tofound thecity itself inthesortof placewhere there willbenoneed ofimports ispretty nearly impossi- ble." "Yes, itisimpossible." "Then, there willalsobeaneed forstillothermenwho willbring toitwhat's needed from another city." "Yes, they willbeneeded." "Now, iftheagent comes empty-handed, bringing nothing needed bythose fromwhom they takewhat theythemselves need, he'llgo 377a away empty-handed, won't he?" "Itseems sotome." "Then theymustproduce athome notonlyenough forthemselves butalsothesortofthing andinthequantity needed bythese others of whom theyhave need." [47 ] ADEIMANTUS/SOCRATES THEREPUBLIC 371a "Yes, theymust." "Soourcityneeds more farmers andother craftsmen." "Itdoesneed more." "And similarly, surely, other agents aswell,who willimport and export thevarious products. They aremerchants, aren't they?" Yes. "Then, we'llneedmerchants too." "Certainly." "And ifthecommerce iscarried onbysea,there willalsobeneed b ofthrongs ofothermenwhoknow thebusiness ofthesea." "Throngs, indeed." "Now what about this? Inthecity itself,how willtheyexchange what theyhaveproduced withoneanother? Itwasforjust thisthatwe made apartnership andfounded thecity." "Plainly," hesaid,"bybuying and selling." "Out ofthis we'll getamarket^^ andanestablished currency^^ asatoken forexchange." "Most certainly." c "Ifthefarmer oranyother craftsman brings what hehaspro- duced tothemarket, andhedoesn't arrive atthesame time asthose whoneedwhathehastoexchange, willhesitinthemarket idle, his craftunattended?" "Not atall,"hesaid."There aremenwho seethissituation and setthemselves tothisservice; inrightly governed cities they areusually thosewhose bodies areweakest andareuseless fordoing anyother job. d Theymust staythere inthemarket andexchange things formoney with thosewhoneed tosellsomething andexchange, formoney again, with allthosewhoneed tobuysomething." "This need, then, produces tradesmen inourcity," Isaid."Don't wecalltradesmen thosemenwho aresetupinthemarket toserve in buying and selling, andmerchants thosewhowander among the cities?" "Most certainly." g "There are, Isuppose, stillsome other sei'vants who, interms of theirminds, wouldn't bequiteuptothelevel ofpartnership, butwhose bodies arestrong enough forlabor. They selltheuseoftheir strength and,because they calltheir price awage, they are, Isuppose, called wage earners, aren't they?" "Most certainly." "Sothewage earners too,asitseems, gotofilloutthecity." "Itseems sotome." "Then hasourcityalready grown tocompleteness, Adeimantus?" [48 ] Book II/37Ia-373a adeimantus/socrates/glaugon "Perhaps." 371g "Where init,then, would justice and injustice be?Along with which ofthethings weconsidered didtheycome intobeing?" "Ican't think, Socrates," hesaid, "unless it'ssomewhere in 372a someneed thesemenhave ofoneanother." "Perhaps what yousay isfine," Isaid. "Itreally mustbecon- sidered andwemustn't backaway. First, let'sconsider whatmanner of lifemen soprovided forwilllead.Won't theymake bread, wine, cloth- ing,andshoes? And,when theyhave built houses, they willwork inthe summer, forthemost partnaked andwithout shoes, andinthewinter adequately clothed andshod. Forfood they willprepare barley meal h andwheat flour; they willcook itandknead it.Setting outnoble loaves ofbarley andwheat onsome reeds orclean leaves, they willstretch out onrushes strewn withyewandmyrtle andfeastthemselves andtheir children. Afterwards they willdrink wine and,crowned withwreathes, singofthegods. Sothey willhavesweet intercourse withoneanother, andnotproduce children beyond their means, keeping aneyeout against poverty orwar." c AndGlaucon interrupted, saying: "Youseem tomake thesemen have their feastwithout relishes." "What yousay istrue," Isaid. "Iforgot that they'll have relishes, too—it'splain they'll have salt, olives, cheese; andthey willboilonions andgreens, justasonegetsthem inthecountry. And tobesure, we'll setdesserts before them— figs,pulseandbeans; and they'll roast myrtle- berries andacorns before thefireanddrink inmeasure along with it. d And
