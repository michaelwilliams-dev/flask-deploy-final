theyarrived atthepalace, Selassie was hischarmingbest. Hedeferred toBalcha, treated him asifhedesper- atelyneeded hisapprovaland cooperation.But Balcha refused tobe charmed, and hewarned Selassie thatifhedidnot return tohiscamp by nightfall,hisarmyhad orders toattack thecapital.Selassie reacted asif hurtbyhismistrust. Over themeal, when itcame time forthetraditional singing ofsongs inhonor ofEthiopia’s leaders, hemade a.point ofallowing only songs honoringthewarlord ofSidarno. Itseemed toBalcha that Se» lassie was scared, intimidated bythisgreat warrior who could notbeout- wittecl. Sensing thechange, Balcha believed that hewould bethe one to call theshots inthedaystocome. Attheend oftheafternoon, Balcha and hissoldiers begantheir march back tocampamidst cheers and gun salutes. Lookingback tothecapital over hisshoulder, heplannedhisstrategy—-howhis own soldiers would march through thecapitalintriumph within weeks, and Selassie would be putinhisplace,hisplace beingeither prisonordeath. When Balcha came insightofhiscamp, however, he saw thatsomethingwasterribly wrong. Where before there had been colorful tents stretchingasfar astheeye could see, now there wasnothing, onlysmoke from doused fires. What devil’s magicwas this? Awitness told Balcha what hadhappened. Duringthebanquet,alarge army, commanded byanallyofSelassie’s, had stolen uponBalcha’s en- campment byaside route hehad not seen. Thisarmyhad not come to light,however: Knowingthat Balcha would/haveheard anoisybattle and hurried back with his600-man bodyguard,Selassie had.armed his own troopswith baskets ofgoldand cash. Theyhad surrounded Balcha’sarmy andproceededtopurchase everylast oneoftheirweapons.Those who re» fused were easily intimidated. Within afewhours, Balcha’s entire force had been disarmed and scattered inalldirections. Realizinghisdanger,Balcha decided tomarch south with his600 sol- diers toregroup, butthe same army that had disarmed hissoldiers blocked hisway.The otherwayout was tomarch onthecapital, but Selassie had set alarge armytodefend it.Like achess player,hehadpredictedBalcha’s moves, and had checkmatecl him. Forthefirst time inhislife, Balcha sur- rendered. Torepenthis sins ofprideandambition, heagreed toenter a monastery.‘ Interpretation ThroughoutSelassie’s long reign,no one could quite figure him out. Ethiopianslike their leaders fierce, butSelassie, who wore thefront ofa gentle, peaceloving man, lasted longer thananyofthem. Neverangryor impatient,helured hisvictims with sweet smiles, lulling them with charm andobsequiousnessbefore heattacked. Inthe case ofBalcha, Selassie playedontheman’s wariness, hissuspicion that thebanquetwas atrap— which infactitwas, butnotthe one heexpected.Selassie’sway ofallaying Balcha’s fears—letting himbringhisbodyguardtothebanquet, givinghim topbilling there, making him feelincontro1—-created athick smoke screen, concealingthereal action three milesaway.
