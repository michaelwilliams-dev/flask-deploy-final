anylonger dare toattempt invasion. Although Machiavelli nowhere definitely stated what perma- nent form ofgovernment histyrant should establish when once hehadunited thewhole ofItaly, itisevident from hisDiscourses upon theFirst Decade ofLivy thatheconsidered theRoman Re- public tohave been themost satisfactory constitution thathad been evolved inthepast, anditmay begathered from certain pas- sages inthatwork thathisideal ofthemost practical form of government closely approximated towhat weshould now calla Constitutional Monarchy, butwith anelected instead ofaheredi- taryking. Itisimportant torealize that, inwriting ThePrince, Machia THE PRINCE —19 velli was working outthedetails ofone part ofhisgeneral scheme forthereorganization ofItaly, andthathewasonly deal- ingwith thetransitional period while thetyrant would begradu- allyacquiring dominion over thecountry; hewasconsidering the difficulties thatwould bemetwith, andhow they could beover- come. Hisview wasthattheconqueror would have tobeaman ofironwill, prepared todevote hislifetotheoneobject inview, andabsolutely indifferent tothemorality ofhismethods, tothe interests ofindividuals, ortothetemporary sufferings ofthena- tion, provided hecould achieve hispurpose. Inthisbook, then, Machiavelli boldly advocated those princi- plesofconduct bywhich alone hebelieved thatitwould bepos- sible forhissuper-tyrant todominate Italy. Hewasnotconcerned with themorality oftheprince's behavior; hewasmaking ascien- tificexposition ofthemethods bywhich acertain object might be attained. Hewasnotendeavoring toexpound how aperfect state should beideally governed; hewasshowing how very imperfect states, andespecially newly created states, were infactsuccess- fully governed. And lastly, hewasnotputting forward ascheme forpermanent government ofasettled state, butmerely stating themethods thatshould beemployed byhistyrant tokeep there- cently conquered territories under control until heshould have completed thesubjection ofthewhole ofItaly andunited itintoa single state. InThePrince Machiavelli frequently refers with approval to Caesar Borgia (under histitle ofDuke Valentine), andhehas sometimes been called 'Machiavelli's Perfect Prince'; butthisis hardly fairtotheauthor. Machiavelli first came intotouch with Caesar ononeofhisdiplomatic missions, andhewaswith this tyrant atthetime ofhisgreatest triumph oftreachery when he succeeded inentrapping allhiscaptains who hadrecently re- volted against him"and immediately putthem todeath. There is little doubt thatitwasthistyrant's conduct andtemporarily suc- cessful career which firstsuggested toMachiavelli what might be attained byCaesar's methods ifapplied tonobler aims, andwhich inspired him with theidea oftheunification ofItaly byone 20- Niccolò Machiavelli strong man ;indeed ,his admiration for the tyrant -solong ashe was successful -was so great that itwas aconstant source of amusement tohis friends ;but anyone who reads The Prince will realize that Machiavelli's ideal conqueror ,while possessing cer- tain qualities which were strongly marked inCaesar's character , such ashis thoroughness ,personal courage ,cleverness ,and apti- tude for administration ,would have tobeendowed with anumber ofvirtues which henever attributed tothe Borgia . The Prince ,read alone ,isapt togive the impression that Ma- chiavelli was concerned with government solely from the point of view ofthe rulers ,regardless ofthe rights ofthe governed ,and it is,therefore ,worth noting that inthe Discourses ,heconstantly showed his interest inand admiration for the people ,often com- paring their merits with those ofprinces tothe disadvantage of the latter ,and itispleasant torecall that Macaulay wrote ofhis work :'We are acquainted with few writings which exhibit so much elevation ofsentiment ,sopure and warm azeal for the public good ,orsojust aview ofthe duties and rights ofcitizens , asthose ofMachiavelli . Machiavelli dedicated The Prince toLorenzo diPiero (the grandson ofLorenzo the Magnificent ),who was just twenty -one years ofage when itwas written .This prince had devoted himself tothe
