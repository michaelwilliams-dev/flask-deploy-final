byseven devils. The doctor cured him with electrical shocks, and asheadministered these heexclaimed that hecould see thedevils flyingoutofthe man’s body,onebyone. Another man claimed tohave swallowed ahay wagon and itsdriver, which were causinghim massive pains inthechest. The Mountain Doctor listened patiently,claimed tobeable tohear thecrack of awhipintheman’s belly, promised tocure him, andgave him asedative and apurgative. The man fellasleepon achair outside thepharmacy.As soon asheawoke hevomited, and ashevomited ahay wagon sped past him (the Mountain Doctor had hired itfortheoccasion), thecrack ofits whip making him feel that somehow hehad indeed expelleditunder the doctor’s care. Over theyears,theMountain Doctor’s famegrew. He was consulted bythepowerful—-—eventhewriter Goethe made thetrek tohisvillage——and hebecame the center ofacultofnature inwhich everythingnatural was considered worthy ofworship. Schiippachwas careful tocreate effects that would entertain andinspirehispatients. Aprofessorwho visited him once wrote, “One stands orsitsincompany,oneplays cards, sometimes with a young woman; now aconcert isgiven,now alunch orsupper,and now a little ballet ispresented.With avery happy effect, thefreedom ofnature is everywhere united with thepleasures ofthebeau monde, andifthedoctor isnotable toheal any diseases, hecan atleast curehypochondriaand the vapors.” Interpretation Schiippachhadbegunhis career asanordinary villagedoctor. Hewould sometimes useinhispracticesome ofthevillageremedies behadgrown upwith, andapparentlyhenoticed some results, for soon these herbal tinc- tures and natural forms ofhealingbecame hisspecialty.And infact his nat— ural form ofhealingdid have profound psychologicaleffects onhis patients. Where thenormal drugs ofthetime created fear andpain, Schiip— pach’streatments were comfortable andsoothing. Theresulting unprove- ment inthepatientsmood was acritical element inthe cures hebrought about. Hispatientsbelieved sodeeplyinhisskills thatthey willed them- selves into health. Instead ofscoffingattheir irrational explanationsfor their ailments, Schiippachused their hypochondriatomake itseem that he had effected agreatcure. The caseof theMountain Doctor teaches usvaluable lessons inthe creation ofacultlike following. First, youmust End a.way toengage peo- ple’s will, tomake their belief inyour powers strong enough thatthey imagine allsorts ofbenefits. Their belief will have aself—fullilling quality, butyou must make sure that itisyou, rather than their own will, who is seen astheagent ofnransformaiion. Find thebelief, cause, orfantasythat will make them believe with apassionandthey willimaginetherest, wor« shipping youashealer, prophet, genius,whateveryou like. Second, Schlippachteaches ustheeverlasting powerofbelief inna- ture, and insimplicity. Nature, inreality,isfullofmuch that isterrifying- poisonous plants,fierce animals, sudden disasters, plagues.Belief inthe healing, comforting quality ofnature isreallyaconstructed myth,aroman« ticism. But theappealtonature canbring you great power, especiallyin complicatedand stressful times. This appeal, however, must behandled right. Devise akind oftheater ofnature inwhichyou,asthedirector, pick and choose thequalitiesthatlit theromanticism ofthetimes. The Mountain Doctor playedtheparttoper- fection, playing uphishomespunwisdom andwit, andstaginghis cures as dramatic pieces.Hedid not make himself one with nature; instead he molded nature into acult, anartificial construction, Tocreate a“natural” effectyouactuallyhave towork hard, makingnature theatrical and de- lightfully pagan.Otherwise no one will notice. Nature too must follow trends and beprogressive. Observance III In1788, attheageoffifty-five, thedoctor and scientist Franz Mesmer was atacrossroads.
