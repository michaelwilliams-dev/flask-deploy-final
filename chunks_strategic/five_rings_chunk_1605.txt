LAW 24 157 18!?‘ LAW 24Scene X The great English landscape painterM.W.Turner (1775-1851)was known forhis useofcolor, which heappliedwith abrilliance and astrange iridescence. The color inhispaintingswas sostriking,infact, that other artists never wanted hiswork hungnext totheirs: Itinevitablymadeevery- thing around itseem dull. ThepainterSirThomas Lawrence once had themisfortune ofseeing Turner’s masterpiece Cologne hanginginanexhibition between two works ofhis own. Lawrence complained bitterlytothegallery owner, whogave him nosatisfaction: After all, someone’: paintingshad tohang next to Tumer’s. ButTurner heard ofLawrence’s complaint,and before theexhibi- tionopened,hetoned down thebrilliant golden skyinCologne, makingitas dull asthecolors inLawrence’s works. Afriend ofTumer’s who saw the painting approachedthe artist with ahorrified look: “What haveyoudone toyour picture!”hesaid. “Well, poorLawrence was sounhappy,”Turner replied,“and it’sonly lampblack. It’llwash offafter theexhibition.” Interpretation Many ofacourtier’s anxieties have todowith themaster, with whom most dangerslie.Yetitisamistake toimaginethat the master istheonlyone to determine your fate.

Byasking ifthere were boars in atParis park,heshowed himself still a.provincial, almost atube. Talleyranddidnot laugh, however, but hecould not resist apractical jokeonthe man who was now hismaster inpolitics, althoughnotinblood andnobility,since Talleyrandcame from anold aristocratic family.ToNapoleorfs question, then, hesimply replied,
