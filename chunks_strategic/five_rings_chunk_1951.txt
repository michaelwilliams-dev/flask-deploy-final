Don't we,ofcourse, saythatthespirited part isalways wholly setonmastery, victory andgood reputation?" b "Quite so." "Ifwewere todesignate itvictory-loving, and honor-loving, would thatstrike theright note?" "Verymuch theright note." "And, moreover, it'splain toeveryone thatthepartwithwhich welearn isalways entirely directed toward knowing thetruth asitis; andoftheparts, itcares least formoney andopinion." "Byfar." "Then would itbeappropriate forustocall itlearning-loving and wisdom-loving?" "Ofcourse." "And," Isaid, "doesn't thispart rule inthesouls ofsome men, cwhile inthatofothers another ofthese parts rules, whichever ithap- pens tobe?" "That's so,"hesaid. "Then that'swhyweassert thatthethree primary classes ofhu- manbeings arealsothree: wisdom-loving, victory-loving, gain-loving." "Entirely so." "Then, alsoofpleasures, arethere three forms, oneunderlying eachofthese?" "Certainly." "Doyouknow," Isaid, "that ifyouwere willing toaskthree such men, each inturn,what isthesweetest ofthese lives, eachwould most d laud hisown?Themoney-maker willassert that,compared togaining, the pleasure inbeing honored orinlearning isworth nothing, unless hemakes somemoney fromthem." "True," hesaid. "Andwhat about thelover ofhonor?" Isaid. "Doesn't hebelieve thepleasure frommoney tobeavulgar thing and,ontheother hand, thepleasure from learning—whatever learning doesn't bring honor—^to besmoke andnonsense?" [262] BookIX1581a-582c glaucon/socrates "That's so,"hesaid. 581d "Asforthelover ofwisdom," Isaid,"what dowesuppose hewill holdabout theother pleasures ascompared with thatofknowing the e truth asitisandalways being insome such state ofpleasure while learning? Won't heholdthem tobefarbehind inpleasure? Andwon't hecallthem really necessary since hedoesn't need alltheothers if necessity didnotaccompany them?" "Thatwemustknow well," hesaid. "Since, then," Isaid, "the pleasures ofeach form, andthe life it- self, dispute with one another, notabout living more nobly or shamefully orworse orbetter butabout living more pleasantly and painlessly, howwouldweknowwhich ofthem speaks most truly?" 582a "Icertainly can't say,"hesaid. "Consider itinthisway.Bywhatmust things thataregoing tobe finely judged bejudged? Isn't itbyexperience, prudence, andargu- ment? Orcould anyone have better criteria thanthese?" "How could he?"hesaid. "Now, consider. Ofthethreemen,which ismostexperienced inall thepleasures ofwhichwewere speaking? Does thelover ofgain, be- cause helearns thetruth itself asitis,seem toyou tobemore ex- perienced inthepleasure thatcomes from knovidng than thelover of wisdom isinthepleasure thatcomes from gaining?" b "There's agreat difference," hesaid. "It's necessary forthe latter totaste oftheother pleasures starting inchildhood. But for thelover ofgain it'snotnecessary totaste, ortohave experience of, howsweet isthepleasure oflearning thenatural characteristics of thethings which are;rather even ifhewere eager to, itwouldn't be easy." "There's agreat difference, then," Isaid,"between thelover of wisdom andthelover ofgain intheir experience ofboth theplea- sures." "Great indeed." c "And what about thelover ofwisdom's relation tothelover of honor? Ishelessexperienced inthepleasure thatcomes from being honored than thelover ofhonor isinthepleasure thatcomes from thinking?" "No," hesaid."Honor accompanies them all, ifeach achieves its aim. Forthewealthy man ishonored bymany; and soarethe courageous manandthewise one.Therefore, allhave experience ofthe kind ofpleasure thatcomes from being honored. Butthekind of pleasure connected vnth thevision ofwhat iscannot betasted by anyone except thelover ofwisdom."

"And, moreover, onlyhewillhave gained hisexperience inthe company ofprudence." "Ofcourse." "Furthermore, astotheinstrument bymeans ofwhich judgment mustbemade, itisnottheinstrument ofthelover ofgainorthelover ofhonor butthatofthelover ofwisdom." "What's that?" "We surely said that itisbymeans ofarguments thatjudgment mustbemade, didn't we?" "Yes." "And arguments areespecially theinstrument ofthephiloso- pher." "Ofcourse." "Now, ifwhat isbeing judged were bestjudged bywealth and e gain,what thelover ofgainpraised andblamed would necessarily be most true." "Verymuch so." "And ifbyhonor, victory, andcourage, wouldn't itbewhat the lover ofhonor andvictory praised andblamed?" "Plainly." "But
