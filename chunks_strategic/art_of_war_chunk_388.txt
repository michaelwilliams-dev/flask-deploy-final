or manner inherent in a thing. A literal translation would have been: �It is not in the true spirit to . . . ,� but to avoid confusion with the translation of kokoro, I decided to avoid the terms spirit and mind. 49. Clearly there was no idea here of drawing the bow using the left hand alone. What is being talked about is carrying a bow so as to use it at some other moment. It should be noted that in battle, warriors carried several weapons at the same time. In addition to the two swords stuck into the belt on the left side, some warriors carried two or three more on their backs so they could change weapons; and others, as Musashi says, carried a bow, a lance, a naginata, and so forth. 50. In spite of what Musashi says, it is extremely difficult to wield a sword easily with just one hand. Even holding a shinai (a bamboo practice sword), which is three to four times lighter than a sword, with just one hand, it is difficult to fight 1. with ease. Nowadays, there are very few practitioners of kendo who use two shinai. The difficulty experienced now must have been much greater when practitioners fought with swords in real combat. The fact is that in sword combat, it is not enough merely to swing the weapon, but one must also be able to parry the attacks of an opponent who is using a heavy sword that he is most often holding with two hands and then be able to slash him. It is not possible to evaluate the difficulty involved in this by fighting with shinai alone. �It is impossible to use two swords without having the innate strength of Niten-sama� (Sir Niten, or Master Niten, was the title of respect given to Musashi). This is an adage that is often heard in sword circles. To give you an example of Musashi�s strength, I cite here a passage from the Nitenki: One day Lord Nagaoka asked Musashi: �How should bamboo poles for flags be chosen?� �Show me the pieces of bamboo you have,� replied Musashi. The Lord had a hundred pieces of bamboo he had ordered for this purpose brought into the garden. Musashi picked up one of the pieces of bamboo, and holding it by the end, made a rapid stroke in the air. He went on to do the same thing with each piece of bamboo. Every one of them broke in half except one, which Musashi gave to the lord, saying, �This one is good.� �That is an absolutely sure way to test them, but it can only be done by you,� replied Lord Nagaoka, smiling. (2, p. 181) 51. It might be useful to make clear just how difficult it is to handle a heavy sword. At the present time in kendo, an adult man uses a shinai that weighs about 500 grams, a woman one that weighs 420 grams. When practitioners
