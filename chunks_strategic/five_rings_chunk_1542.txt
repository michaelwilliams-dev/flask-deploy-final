Once Count Victor Lustig,swindle:parexcellence, had sold dozens ofsuckers around thecountryaphony box with which heclaimed tobeable tocopy money. Discoveringtheir mistake, thesuckers generallychose nottogothepolice, rather than risk theembarrassment ofpublicity.But one Sherifi Richards, ofRernsen County, Oklahoma, was notthekind ofman toaccept being conned outof$10,000, and onemorninghetracked Lustigdown toahotel inChicago.

I’llalso give youwritten instruclions onhow towork the ma- chine andI’ll come out toOklahoma tomake sure it’sworking properly. There’s noway youcan lose onthat.” The sheriff reluctantly agreed.To satisfyhimtotally, Lustig took out ahundred one-hundred—dollar bills and gave them tohim, telling him torelax and have afunweekend inChicago.
