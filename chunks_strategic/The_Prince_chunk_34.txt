ones , underesti. mated the Church's temporal power and now the King of France himself trembles . Alexander has taken over Italy, and ruined the Venetians . Since this is the case , maybe we should bring these events to mind . Before King Charles of France invaded Italy in 1494 , this province was ruled by the Pope , by Venetians , by the King of Naples , by the Duke of Milan and by the Florentines . These po.tentates care about two things : one , that no foreigner enter Italy with arms ; two , that no potentate expand his state . The most trou.blesome were the Pope and the Venetians . To keep after the Ve. 72-Niccol� Machiavelli netians, the others had to hold together, as in the defense of Ferrara ( 1482-1484 ) . To hold the Pope back, the others played on the Barons of Rome . The Barons of Rome were divided into two factions, the Orsini and the Colonna, with scandals going on be.tween the two . Armed and under the eyes of the Popes , they kept the papacy weak. Although sometimes a strong Pope like Sistus IV ( 1471-1484 ) emerged , neither fortune nor savvy could get around the Barons . The shortness of Popes ' lives was the real reason a Pope ruled on average ten years . In this short time , it was impossible to knock one of the factions out. If one almost did the Colonnas in , another enemy of the Orsini would turn up , re.viving the Colonnas, and the Orsini themselves never gave way. Julius not only followed but also increased these practices , hoping to gain Bologna, finish off the Venetians , and chase the French out of Italy. He succeeded in all these , to his own re- known , working for the Church and not just some private con.cern. He kept the Orsini and Colonnas at bay, and though there was friction, two things kept them quiet: the greatness of the Church, and the fact that neither family had a cardinal in the Sa.cred College . Such parties are never quiet with a cardinal because cardinals nurse parties in and outside Rome, and the Barons have to defend them. The ambitions of cardinals nourish discord and tumult among the barons . The papacy of Leo X followed THE PRINCE � 73 (1513-1521), a Medici, and a powerful Pope who, while the bar.ons made him great with their arms, he made his reputation and was venerated for other munificent virtues.
