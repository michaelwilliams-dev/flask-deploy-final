the Hojian army entered the ancient capital of China. Now the emperor�s general, following orders, went after the Hojian army in the capital city. When the Hojian soldiers saw the imperial cavalcade in the distance, they began to have fears, and their commander could not stop them. Ultimately the demoralized Hojian forces suffered a crushing defeat, with the dead and wounded filling the streets. The Hojian general retreated to an outlying position. Everyone was broken in spirit and had no more will to fight. Many of them urged the Hojian general to flee by night. The general, however, responded, �It is a matter of course for there to be victory and defeat in a military action. What is important is to use failure to achieve success.

Meanwhile, the Tang court also sent an ambassador to the Turks to reassure them. Now the Chinese general said to one of his chief assistant commanders, �When our ambassador arrives, the Turks will surely feel secure. If we send out a cavalry to attack them now, we will surely gain our desire.� The assistant commander said, �But the emperor has already accepted the Turks� surrender, and our own ambassador will be among them�what about that?� The general said, �This is an opportunity not to be lost�why hold back just to spare the ambassador�s life?� Then the Chinese general quickly mobilized his troops and set out to ride on the Turks. They encountered over a thousand Turkish scouts on the way and took them all captive. When the Turkish khan saw the ambassador of the imperial Tang court, he
