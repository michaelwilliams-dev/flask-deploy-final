light shot up from the city walls, and Huang-fu Sung, sounding his drums, led a rapid charge, which threw the rebels into confusion and put them to headlong flight." [HOU HAN SHU, ch. 71.] ] 1. (5) When you start a fire, be to windward of it. Do not attack from the leeward. [Chang Yu, following Tu Yu, says: "When you make a fire, the enemy will retreat away from it; if you oppose his retreat and attack him then, he will fight desperately, which will not conduce to your success." A rather more obvious explanation is given by Tu Mu: "If the wind is in the east, begin burning to the east of the enemy, and follow up the attack yourself from that side. If you start the fire on the east side, and then attack from the west, you will suffer in the same way as your enemy."] 1. A wind that rises in the daytime lasts long, but a night breeze soon falls. [Cf. Lao Tzu�s saying: "A violent wind does not last the space of a morn- ing." (TAO TE CHING, chap. 23.) Mei Yao-ch�en and Wang Hsi say: "A day breeze dies down at nightfall, and a night breeze at daybreak. This is what happens as a general rule." The phenomenon observed may be correct enough, but how this sense is to be obtained is not apparent.] 1. In every army, the five developments connected with fire must be known, the movements of the stars calculated, and a watch kept for the proper days. [Tu Mu says: "We must make calculations as to the paths of the stars, and watch for the days on which wind will rise, before making our attack with fire." Chang Yu seems to interpret the text differently: "We must not only know how to assail our opponents with fire, but also be on our guard against similar attacks from them."] 1. Hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show intelligence; those who use water as an aid to the attack gain an accession of strength. CHAPTER 13. THE ATTACK BY FIRE 119 1. By means of water, an enemy may be intercepted, but not robbed of all his belongings. [Ts�ao Kung�s note is: "We can merely obstruct the enemy�s road or di- vide his army, but not sweep away all his accumulated stores." Water can do useful service, but it lacks the terrible destructive power of fire. This is the reason, Chang Yu concludes, why the former is dismissed in a couple of sentences, whereas the attack by fire is discussed in detail. Wu Tzu (ch. 4) speaks thus of the two elements: "If an army is encamped on low-lying marshy ground, from which the water cannot run off, and where the rain- fall is heavy, it may be submerged by a flood. If an army is encamped in wild marsh lands thickly overgrown with weeds and brambles, and visited by frequent gales, it may be
