"All right," Isaid."Three ofthem havebeen spied outinour city, atleast sufficiently toformsome opinion. Nowwhatwould bethe remaining form thanks towhich thecitywould further partake invir- tue? For, plainly, this isjustice." "Plainly." "Sothen, Glaucon, wemust, likehunters, now station ourselves in acircle around thethicket andpayattention sothatjustice doesn't slip through somewhere and disappear into obscurity. Clearly it's c somewhere hereabouts. Look toitandmake every effort tocatch sight ofit;youmight somehow see itbeforemeandcould tellme."

"Listen whether after allImake anysense," Isaid."That rulewe 433a setdown atthebeginning astowhatmustbedone ineverything when wewerefounding thecity— this,oracertain form ofit,is,inmyopin- ion,justice. Surely wesetdown andoften said, ifyouremember, that eachonemust practice oneofthefunctions inthe city, thatone for which hisnature made himnaturally most fit." "Yes,wewere saying that." "And further, that justice istheminding ofone'sown business andnotbeing abvisybody, thiswehavebothheard frommany others andhave often said ourselves." h "Yes,wehave." "Well, then,myfriend," Isaid, "this— thepractice ofminding one'sownbusiness— when itcomes intobeing inacertain way, is probably justice. Doyouknowhow Iinfer this?" "No," hesaid, "tellme." "Inmyopinion," Isaid, "after having considered moderation, courage, andprvidence, this iswhat's leftover inthecity; itprovided thepower bywhich allthese others came intobeing; and,oncehaving come intobeing, itprovides them with preservation aslong asit'sin thecity.Andyetwewere saying thatjustice would bewhat's leftover c from thethree ifwefovmd them."
