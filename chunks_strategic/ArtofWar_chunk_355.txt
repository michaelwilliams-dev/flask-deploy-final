the solid and strikings at openings. The course of water is determined by earth, the way to military victory depends on the opponent. Thus a militia has no permanently fixed configuration, no constant form. Those who are able to seize victory by adapting to opponents are called experts. No element is always dominant, no season is always present. Some days are shorter, some are longer; the moon wanes away and then reappears. [ 7 ] Armed Struggle The general rule for military operations is that the military leadership gets the order from the civilian leadership to assemble an army, gather troops, and mass at the front. Nothing is harder than armed struggle. The difficulty of armed struggle is making a circuitous route into the most direct way, turning problems into advantages. Thus when you take a circuitous route�thereby leading on opponents with the prospect of gain�leaving after others but arriving before them, then you are the one who knows strategic use of circuitousness�s directness. Thus armed struggle can be profitable and can be perilous. If you mobilize the whole army to fight for the advantage, you will be too late; if you leave the army behind to fight for advantage, then equipment will be lost. Thus if you rush off with your armor in storage, marching double time day and night to fight for advantage too far away, then your top command will be captured; the strongest will get there first, laggards later, and as a rule only one in ten will make it at all. If you struggle for advantage at a considerable distance, your vanguard commander will be felled, and as a rule only half your force will ever get there. If you struggle for advantage at a somewhat lesser distance, then two out of three will get there. Therefore an army will perish if it has no equipment, no food, or no reserves. So those who do not know the plans of competitors cannot enter capably into preliminary negotiations; those who do not know the lay of the land cannot maneuver a militia; those who do not use local guides cannot gain the advantages of the terrain. Therefore a military force stands on deceit and moves according to advantage; division and combination are the means of adaptation. When it moves swiftly, it is like the wind; when it moves slowly, it is like a forest; when it raids, it is like fire; when it is still, it is like a mountain. Inscrutable as the darkness, it moves like thunder rumbling. To plunder an area, it distributes its troops; to broaden territory, it parcels out defense of the critical positions. Action is taken after weighing strategy. The first side to know how to make strategic use of circuitous and direct routes is the one to win; this is a law of armed conflict. A classic on military order says, �Gongs and drums are used because words cannot be heard; pennants and flags are used because soldiers cannot see
