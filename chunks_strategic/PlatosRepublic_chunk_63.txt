not themselves make up tales." "That's correct," he said. "But, that is just it; what would the models for speech about the gods45 be." "Doubtless something like this," I said. "The god must surely al? ways be described such as he is, whether one presents him in epics, lyrics, or tragedies." "Yes, he must be." "Then, is the god really good, and, hence, must he be said to be so?" "Of course." "Well, but none of the good things is haimful, ,is it?" "Not in my opinion." "Does that which isn't harmful do hmm?" "In no way." "Does that which does not harm do any evil?" "Not that, either." "That which does no evil would not be the cause of any evil?" "How could it be?" "What about this? Is the good beneficial?" ''Yes." "Then it's the cause of doing well?" "Yes." "Then the good is not the cause of everything; rather it is the cause of the things that are in a good way, while it is not responsible for the bad things." 379 b "Yes," he said, "that's entirely so." c "Then," I said, "the god, since he's good, wouldn't be the cause� of everything, as the many say, but the cause of a few things for human beings and not responsible for most. For the things that are good for us are far fewer than those that are bad; and of the good things, no one else must be said to be the cause; of the bad things, some other causes must be sought and not the god." "What you say," he said, "is in my opinion very true." "Then," I said, "we mustn't accept Homer's-or any other- poet's-foolishly making this mistake about the gods and saying that d Two jars stand on Zeus's threshold Full of dooms-the one of good, the other of wretched; and the man to whom Zeus gives a mixture of both, At one time he happens on evil, at another good; but the man to whom he doesn't give a mixture, but the second pure, Evil misery, drives him over the divine earth;46 nor that Zeus is the dispenser to us Of good and evil alike.47 And, as to the violation of the oaths and truces that Pandarus com? mitted, if someone says Athena and Zeus were responsible for its hap? pening,48 we'll not praise him; nor must the young be allowed to hear that Themis and Zeus were responsible for strife and contention among the gods,49 nor again, as Aeschylus says, that God plants the cause in mortals When he wants to destroy a house utterly. e 380a 380a b C d e 381 a And if someone produces a 'Sorrows of Niobe,'5� the work where these iambics are, or a 'Sorrows of the Pelopidae: or the 'Trojan Sor? rows; or anything else of the sort, either he mustn't be allowed to say that they are the deeds of a god, or, if of a god, he must find a speech
