and they were impatient with his cruelty, and his other enemies rose against him, they simply killed him. I don�t want to discuss Eleogabalus, son of Macrinus � son of Julian, who was gotten rid of immediately, so I will conclude the discourse. Princes of our time have less difficulty satisfying the armies and governments. They have to give it some attention but can resolve this more quickly since these Princes are not compromised by armies and offices involved in provincial ad.ministrations, as were the Roman military. Then it was necessary to play more to the armies because they had more influence than the people. Now, except for the Sultans of Turkey and Greece, the Princes owe more to the people because the people exercise more influence. The Turkish Sultan is an exception because he keeps twelve thousand infantry and fifteen thousand cavalry close at hand. The security and strength of the realm depend on them. Above all, the Sultan needs to keep them friendly. Similarly the Sultan of Egypt who is in the hands of the soldiers. He also, regardless of the people, must keep the army friendly. Note that Egypt under the Sultan differs from other Principalities, because it is like the Christian papacy, which is neither a hereditary nor a new princi 106� Niccol� Machiavelli pality. Not the son of the old Prince, or any other heredity, but the office is elected by the elders who are in authority. Since the of.fice is ancient, it is not a new Principality, and there are none of the difficulties of a new Principality. Although the Prince himself is new, the orders and offices, which he enters, are traditional, as if he were a hereditary ruler. But returning to our subject, I suggest that anyone who fol.lows the above discourse will see that either hatred or scorn were the causes of downfall of those emperors I mentioned. And one can see why some came a bad end and the others reached to happy ends. For Pertinacius and Alexander, both being new Princes, it was useless and harmful to imitate Marcus, who was a hereditary Prince. Carcalla, Commodius, and Massiminius should to never have imitated Severius, not having the virtue necessary follow in his footsteps. A new Prince in a new Principality cannot imitate Marcus, nor should try do what Severius did. He he to should take those qualities of Severius necessary for founding a state of his own and mix them with the glorious qualities of Mar.cus, which are necessary for conserving and maintaining a state already on its feet. ON FORTS AND OTHER THINGS OF EVERYDAY USE OR NOT TO PRINCES S ome Princes, for reasons of security, have disarmed their subjects,encouragedothers have partitiothers hav sought others hostile factions, ned their territory, to win have over suspect elements, others have built fortresses, still other have torn them down. Although one cannot judge the advisability of such measures apart from the particulars of those situations where they take place, nevertheless
