presenting an argument for this that isn't ridiculous?" "No," he said, "nor do I suppose I shall hear one." "Well, then, keep all this in mind and recall this question: Can a multitude accept or believe that the fair itself, rather than the many fair things, or that anything itself, is, rather than the many particular 494 things?" "Not in the least," he said. "Then it's impossible," I said, "that a multitude be philosophic." "Yes, it is impossible." "And so, those who do philosophize are necessarily blamed by them." "Necessarily." "As weH as by all those private men who consort with the mob and desire to please it." "Plainly." "So, on this basis, what salvation do you see for a philosophic nature so that it will remain in its practice and reach its end? Think it C d e 195 a over on the basis of what went before. We did agree that facility at learning, memory, courage, and magnificence belong to this nature." "Yes.ï¿½ "Won't such a one be first among all in everything, straight from the beginning, especially if his body naturally matches his soul?" "Of course he will," he said. "Then I suppose kinsmen and fellow citizens will surely want to make use of him, when he is older, for their own affairs." "Of course." "They will, therefore, lie at his feet begging and honoring him, taking possession of and flattering beforehand the power that is going to be his." "At least," he said, "that's what usually happens." "What do you suppose," I said, "such a young man will do in such circumstances, especially ifhe chances to be from a big city, is rich and noble in it, and is, further, good-looking and tall? Won't he be overflowing with unbounded hope, believing he will be competent to mind the business of both Greeks and barbarians, and won't he, as a result, exalt himself to the heights, mindlessly full of pretension and empty conceit?"13 "Indeed he will," he said. "Now, if someone were gently to approach the young man in this condition and tell him the truth-that he has no intelligence in him al? though he needs it, and that it's not to be acquired except by slaving for its acquisition-do you think it will be easy for him to hear through a wall of so many evils?" "Far from it," he said. "But if," I said, "thanks to his good nature and his kinship to such speeches, one young man were to apprehend something and be turned and drawn toward philosophy, what do we suppose those will do who believe they are losing his use and comradeship? Is there any deed they won't do or any word they won't say, concerning him, so that he won't be persuaded, and concerning the man who's doing the persuading, so that he won't be able to persuade; and won't they organize private plots and public trials?" "It's very necessary," he said. "Is it possible that such a man will philosophize?"
