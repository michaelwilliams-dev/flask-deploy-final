the example of the term ippon used in all the contemporary Japanese martial arts to indicate a victory. Ippon is a contraction of ichi hon, hon meaning �fundamental� or �essential.� In a training session or a tournament, it is customary to count the number of bouts won by each participant. Ippon refers to a win obtained through the use of a single technique within a system of conventions where it is recognized that if the particular movement in question had been fully completed outside the conventional system, the opponent would have suffered a blow that would have put him out of combat. In the days when people fought with real swords or with wooden swords, the result of a duel was most often determined by the use of a single decisive technique. During the period of Musashi�s youth, the result was death. However, in performing combat exercises within a school, thanks to the conventions that were adopted, the practitioners could engage in combat repeatedly in a series of many bouts. They then counted up the number of victories and defeats in terms of units of hon (ippon). What is sought after in the martial arts is the ideal ippon, that is, a victory obtained through a technique that has an integral connection with that which is fundamental to the combat. 44. Ryo koshi means �two swords.� Ryo means �two,� and koshi is the unit used to count swords. 1. 45. The naginata is a weapon with a long handle and a thick, curved blade like that of a scythe. 46. To no momo: To is currently pronounced soto and means �outside�; mono means �weapon.� Thus the expression means �weapon meant to be used outside,� among other places, on the field of battle. The ideogram to or soto is also pronounced hoka. In that case the meaning is different: �the realm or world that exists outside the ordinary one; a thing that exists outside normal standards; elsewhere, other than.� If we interpret it in this sense, then the sword being the normal weapon of the warrior, the lance and the naginata are added on to that. We could then translate: �The lance and the naginata are weapons of war additional to the sword.� 47. It should be noted here that in Musashi�s text, the designation for each of the two swords is not consistent. Sometimes he uses tachi and katana and sometimes katana and wakizashi. As he himself explained in the previous paragraph, the two expressions mean �the large sword and the small sword,� but katana refers to the small sword in the first expression and the large one in the second. In Musashi�s time, the names of the swords had not yet become altogether fixed. 48. �It is deplorable to . . . ,� hoie ni aru bekarazu: Hoi is pronounced honi at the present time and means (1) �true mind,� �spirit,� or �intention,� �initial intention,� �true desire�; (2) true sense, true meaning; (3) that which originally should be, character
