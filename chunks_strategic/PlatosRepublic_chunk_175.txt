over which they show the puppets." "I see," he said. "Then also see along this wan human beings carrying all sorts of artifacts, which project above the wan, and statues of men and other animals wrought from stOI).e, wood, and every kind of material; as is to be expected, some of the carriers utter sounds while others are silent." "It's a strange image," he said, "and strange prisoners you're telling of." "They're like us," I said. "For in the first place, do you suppose such men would have seen anything of themselves and one another other than the shadows cast by the fire on the side of the cave facing them?" 514 a b C 515 a :LAUCON/SOCRATF..S THE REPUBLIC 515 a "How could they," he said, "if they h d been compelled to keep b. their heads motionless throughout �Jife?� "And what about the things that are carried by?
