saythatthey aredrudgery butbeneficial tous;andwewould not d choose tohavethem forthemselves butforthesakeofthewages and whatever elsecomes outofthem." "Yes, there isalso thisthird"Isaid, "butwhat ofit?" "Inwhich ofthem," hesaid,"would youinclude justice?" 358a "I,formypart, suppose," Isaid, "that itbelongs inthe finest kind, which themanwho isgoing tobeblessed should likeboth for itselfandforwhatcomes outofit." "Well, that's nottheopinion ofthemany," hesaid, "rather it seems tobelong totheform ofdrudgery, which should bepracticed for thesakeofwages andthereputation thatcomes from opinion;^ but all byitself itshould befledfrom assomething hard." "Iknow this isthepopular opinion," Isaid,"and awhile ago justice, taken asbeing such,wasblamed byThrasymachus while in- justice waspraised. But I,asitseems, amapoor learner." b "Come, now," hesaid, "hearmetoo,andsee ifyou stillhave the same opinion. For itlooks tomeasthough Thrasymachus, likeasnake, hasbeencharmed more quickly thanheshould have been; yettomy wayofthinking therewas stillnoproof about either. For Idesire to hearwhat each isandwhatpower ithas allalonebyitselfwhen itisin thesoul— dismissing itswages and itsconsequences. SoIshall do it c thisway, ifyoutooconsent: I'llrestore Thrasymachus' argument, and first I'lltellwhat kind ofthing they sayjustice isandwhere itcame from; second, that allthosewho practice itdosounwillingly, as necessary butnotgood; third, that itisfitting thattheydoso,forthe lifeoftheunjustman is,after all,farbetter than thatofthejustman, as they say.For,Socrates, though that's notatallmyownopinion, Iamat aloss: I'vebeen talked deafbyThrasymachus andcountless others, while theargument onbehalf ofjustice—that itisbetter than in- d justice— I'veyettohearfromanyone asIwant it.Iwant tohear itex- tolled allbyitself, and Isuppose Iwould bemost likely tolearn that from you. That's thereason why I'llspeak invehement praise ofthe unjust life,andinspeaking I'llpoint outtoyouhow Iwant tohear you, inyour turn,blame injustice andpraise justice. See ifwhat I'msaying iswhat youwant." "Most ofall," Isaid."What would anintelligent manenjoy talk- ingandhearing aboutmore again andagain?" e "What yousay isquite fine," hesaid."Now listen towhat Isaid I wasgoing totellfirst—what justice isandwhere itcame from. "They saythatdoing injustice isnaturally good, andsuffering in- justice bad,butthatthebad insuffering injustice farexceeds thegood indoing it;sothat,when theydoinjustice tooneanother andsuffer it [36 ] Book II/357c-360a glaucon and taste ofboth, itseems profitable— tothosewho arenotable to 358e escape theoneandchoose theother— tosetdown acompact among 359a themselves neither todoinjustice nortosuffer it.Andfrom there they began tosetdown theirownlawsandcompacts and tonamewhat the lawcommands lawful and just.And this, then, isthegenesis andbeing ofjustice; itisamean between what isbest—doing injustice without paying thepenalty— andwhat isworst— suffering injustice without being able toavenge oneself. The just isinthemiddle between these two,cared fornotbecause itisgoodbutbecause itishonored duetoa want ofvigor indoing injustice. Themanwho isable todo itand is b truly amanwould never setdown acompact withanyone nottodoin- justice andnottosuffer it.He'dbemad.Now thenature ofjustice is thisandofthis sort,and itnaturally grows outofthese sorts ofthings. Sotheargument goes. "That even thosewho practice itdosounwillingly, from anin- capacity todoinjustice, wewould bestperceive ifweshould inthought dosomething like this:giveeach, thejustmanandtheunjust, license to c dowhatever hewants, whilewefollow andwatch where hisdesire will leadeach.Wewould catch thejustmanred-handed going thesameway astheunjustman outofadesire togetthebetter; this iswhat any nature naturally pursues asgood, while itislaw^which byforce per- verts ittohonor equality.
