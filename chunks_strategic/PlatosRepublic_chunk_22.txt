in the use of each and useful in its uselessness?" 'Tm afraid so." d. "Then justice, my friend, wouldn't be anything very serious, if it is useful for useless things. Let's look at it this way. Isn't the man who is cleverest at landing a blow in boxing, or any other kind of fight, also the one cleverest at guarding against it?" "Certainly." "And whoever is clever at guarding against disease is also cleverest at getting away with producing it?" "In my opinion, at any rate." "And, of course, a good guardian of an army is the very same man 334 a who can also steal the enemy's plans and his other dispositions?" "Certainly." "So of whatever a man is a clever guardian, he is also a clever thief?" "It seems so." "So that if a man is clever at guarding money, he is also clever at stealing it?" "So the argument25 indicates at least," he said. "The just man, then, as it seems, has come to light as a kind of robber, and I'm afraid you learned this from Homer. For he admires b Autolycus, Odysseus' grandfather26 on his mother's side, and says he surpassed all men 'in stealing and in swearing oaths.' Justice, then, seems, according to you and Homer and Simonides, to be a certain art of stealing, for the benefit, to be sure, of friends and the harm of ene? mies. Isn't that what you meant?" "No, by Zeus," he said. "But I no longer know what I did mean. However, it is still my opinion that justice is helping friends and harming enemies." "Do you mean by friends those who seem to. be good to an in? dividual, or those who are, even if they don't seem to be, and similarly with enemies?" "It's likely," he said, "that the men one believes to be good, one loves, while those he considers bad one hates." "But don't human beings make mistakes about this, so that many seem to them to be good although they are not, and vice versa?" "They do make mistakes." "So for them the good are enemies and the bad are friends?" "Certainly." "But nevertheless it's still just for them to help the bad and harm the good?" "It looks like it" "Yet the good are just and such as not to do injustice?" "True.ï¿½ "Then, according to your argument, it's just to treat badly men who have done nothing unjust?" "Not at all, Socrates," he said. "For the argument seems to be bad." "Then, after all," I said, "it's just to harm the unjust and help the just?" "This looks finer than what we just said." "Then for many, Polemarchus-all human beings who make mistakes-it will turn out to be just to harm friends, for their friends are bad; and just to help enemies, for they are good. So we shall say the very opposite of what we asserted Simonides means." "It does really turn out that way," he said. "But let's
