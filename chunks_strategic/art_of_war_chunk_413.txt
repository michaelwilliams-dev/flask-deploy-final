scholars have misread Sun Tzu, distorting his words and trying to make them square with their own one-sided views. Thus, though commentators have not been lacking, only a few have proved equal to the task. My friend Sheng-yu has not fallen into this mistake. In attempting to provide a critical commentary for Sun Tzu�s work, he does not lose sight of the fact that these sayings were in- tended for states engaged in internecine warfare; that the author is not concerned with the military conditions prevailing under the sovereigns of the three ancient dynasties,42 nor with the nine punitive measures prescribed to the Minister of War.43 Again, Sun Wu loved brevity of diction, but his meaning is always deep. Whether the subject be marching an army, or handling soldiers, or estimating the enemy, or controlling the forces of victory, it is always systematically treated; the sayings are bound together in strict logical sequence, though this has been ob- scured by commentators who have probably failed to grasp their meaning. In his 42The Hsia, the Shang and the Chou. Although the last-named was nominally existent in Sun Tzu�s day, it retained hardly a vestige of power, and the old military organization had practically gone by the board. I can suggest no other explanation of the passage. 43See CHOU LI, xxix. 6-10. CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION 20 own commentary, Mei Sheng-yu has brushed aside all the obstinate prejudices of these critics, and has tried to bring out the true meaning of Sun Tzu himself. In this way, the clouds of confusion have been dispersed and the sayings made clear. I am convinced that the present work deserves to be handed down side by side with the three great commentaries; and for a great deal that they find in the say- ings, coming generations will have constant reason to thank my friend Sheng-yu. Making some allowance for the exuberance of friendship, I am inclined to en- dorse this favorable judgment, and would certainly place him above Ch�en Hao in order of merit. 9. WANG HSI, also of the Sung dynasty, is decidedly original in some of his in- terpretations, but much less judicious than Mei Yao-ch�en, and on the whole not a very trustworthy guide. He is fond of comparing his own commentary with that of Ts�ao Kung, but the comparison is not often flattering to him. We learn from Ch�ao Kung-wu that Wang Hsi revised the ancient text of Sun Tzu, filling up lacunae and correcting mistakes.44 10. HO YEN-HSI of the Sung dynasty. The personal name of this commentator is given as above by Cheng Ch�iao in the TUNG CHIH, written about the middle of the twelfth century, but he appears simply as Ho Shih in the YU HAI, and Ma Tuan-lin quotes Ch�ao Kung-wu as saying that his personal name is unknown. There seems to be no reason to doubt Cheng Ch�iao�s statement, otherwise I should have been inclined to hazard a guess and identify him with one Ho Ch�u- fei,
