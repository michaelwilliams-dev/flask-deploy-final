paradoxical notion, but it is made to sound more plausible by using a word that reminds of the musical nomos as well as the political (cf. 365e, note 18). 3. Cf. 348c, note 44. 4. Eidos. 5. The shrine at Delphi belonged to Apollo; Socrates leaves the prac? tices.of piety to the oldest of the traditional sources; this is the only thing the philosopher-founder does not institute. In the temple, where the oracles were given, there was a golden globe, which was supposed to be the center or the navel of the earth. 1. Wisdom is here identified with the capacity of the political coun? selor. The word euboulos reflects the deliberation in public council (cf. 348d). It was an epithet of several gods. 2. The word for knowledge (episteme) is said by Socrates (Cratylus, 435a) to have the same root (histemi) as that for "supervising," used here (proistemi) and in 443e (ephistamai). The supervisors supervise by virtue of knowledge; the teaching that knowledge is the title to rule is thus implied in the very words. 3. Chalestra was a town on the Thermaic gulf in Macedonia. In a near? by lake there was carbonate of soda used in washing. 4. Lawful in the sense of "conforming to or based on law." There is some authority for reading "lasting" (monimon) instead of "lawful" (no? mimon). 5. That is, the courage of a citizen, the courage necessary to a city. Soc? rates leaves open the possibility that there is a higher form of courage which is radically different from that expressed in the willingness to die at the law's command. Courage, simply, without the qualification political, cannot be based on this form of opinion. It consists precisely in the willingness to ques? tion opinions, even the most authoritative ones. 6. The analogy is to the hunt, a frequent analogon of philosophy in So? cratic discourse. 7. The Greek sentence has a double sense: (a) stretching through every member of the whole city; (b) stretching through every note in the scale. 8. The Greek is an exclamation, iou, iou, which is usually a shout of grief but can also express joy. It is characteristic of the drama. 9. Cf. 479d. 10. Eidos. 1. TheGreek word is methodos, which means ther:�one talces,a pur? suit, a search, and the manner of that search. "Method" has takeri on.too rigid� a sense in modem science to be used as an accurate translation. � � 2. Literally, "cause," or "a basis for an imputation." � 3. The different stocks of men and the particular political talents con? nected with them, as formed by the climates of the north, the.center, and the south, are constant themes of political thought, beginning with Herodotus Plato, and Aristotle, and continuing through Montesquieu. 4. This is the earliest-known explicit statement of the principle of con tradiction-the premise of philosophy and the foundation of rational discourse. 5. Eidos. 6. Logismos, a derivative of logos, is used primarily to denote the com? putation of
