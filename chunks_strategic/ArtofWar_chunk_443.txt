who are better acquainted with their profession, having only the capital object in view, guard against a decisive blow, and acquiesce in small misfortunes to avoid greater."] 1. Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible at- tacks; numerical strength, from compelling our adversary to make these preparations against us. [The highest generalship, in Col. Henderson�s words, is "to compel the enemy to disperse his army, and then to concentrate superior force against each fraction in turn."] 1. Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle, we may concentrate from the greatest distances in order to fight. [What Sun Tzu evidently has in mind is that nice calculation of distances and that masterly employment of strategy which enable a general to di- vide his army for the purpose of a long and rapid march, and afterwards to effect a junction at precisely the right spot and the right hour in order to confront the enemy in overwhelming strength. Among many such suc- cessful junctions which military history records, one of the most dramatic and decisive was the appearance of Blucher just at the critical moment on the field of Waterloo.] 1. But if neither time nor place be known, then the left wing will be impotent to succor the right, the right equally impotent to succor the left, the van CHAPTER 7. WEAK POINTS AND STRONG 57 unable to relieve the rear, or the rear to support the van. How much more so if the furthest portions of the army are anything under a hundred LI apart, and even the nearest are separated by several LI! [The Chinese of this last sentence is a little lacking in precision, but the mental picture we are required to draw is probably that of an army advan- cing towards a given rendezvous in separate columns, each of which has orders to be there on a fixed date. If the general allows the various detach- ments to proceed at haphazard, without precise instructions as to the time and place of meeting, the enemy will be able to annihilate the army in de- tail. Chang Yu�s note may be worth quoting here: "If we do not know the place where our opponents mean to concentrate or the day on which they will join battle, our unity will be forfeited through our preparations for defense, and the positions we hold will be insecure. Suddenly happening upon a powerful foe, we shall be brought to battle in a flurried condition, and no mutual support will be possible between wings, vanguard or rear, especially if there is any great distance between the foremost and hindmost divisions of the army."] 1. Though according to my estimate the soldiers of Yueh exceed our own in number, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory. I say then that victory can be achieved. [Alas for these brave words! The long feud between the two states ended in 473 B.C. with the total defeat of Wu by
